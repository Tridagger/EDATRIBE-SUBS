1
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,586
Over the course of 1,000 years,

2
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:51,125
the spiritual energy of heaven and
earth gave birth to the Chaos Pearl.

3
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:56,417
Feeding off the sun and moon, its
power grew at an unstoppable rate.

4
00:01:56,696 --> 00:02:00,417
The divine and demonic life
forces it absorbed fused together,

5
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:03,641
making it unstoppable and no less hungry.

6
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:10,914
So my master, the supreme lord of heaven,
sent my brother and I to put a stop to the chaos.

7
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,267
I know what you're thinking,

8
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,383
"Who's that dashing rogue on the pig?"

9
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,833
That would be me, Taiyi Zhenren.

10
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,749
And If I weren't so busy being a super
impressive butt-kicking, day-saving monk,

11
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,992
I've been told I could be a model.

12
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,469
Chaos Pearl.

13
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,890
You can't escape.

14
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,774
This is the end of the line.

15
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,781
Don't scare it, you big meanie.

16
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,258
Go on. There's a good pearl.

17
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:38,836
Come here. Here, boy!

18
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,138
Or girl?

19
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:52,696
Uh...

20
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:04,539
It's over!

21
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,586
It absorbs energy!

22
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,000
You bruised my moneymaker.

23
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,591
Someone needs a time out.

24
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,248
Hit me now. I dare ya!

25
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,521
I was just playin' around?

26
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,422
Master!

27
00:04:28,138 --> 00:04:31,547
I have divided the Chaos Pearl into two parts,

28
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:34,664
The Spirit Pearl and the Demon Pill.

29
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,500
The Demon Pill is dangerous and nearly indestructible.

30
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,961
I'm casting a heaven-made curse,

31
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:46,032
a lightning bolt that will seek out
and destroy it in three years' time.

32
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:50,211
Until that day, you must stay vigilant and watch over it.

33
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,289
Li Jing has won my favor in battle.

34
00:04:54,458 --> 00:05:00,438
And so, the Spirit Pearl will be
reincarnated into his third-born son.

35
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,250
I shall entrust this task to you, my disciple.

36
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:06,438
Huh?

37
00:05:06,542 --> 00:05:07,633
Right now,

38
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,774
Eleven Golden Immortals sit beside me.

39
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:14,032
If the pearl is successfully reincarnated,

40
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:17,711
then you shall join me in the Court of Heaven.

41
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,078
You can count on me, master. Thank you so much!

42
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:24,391
Once the Spirit Pearl is born

43
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,313
call him...

44
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,938
Ne Zha.

45
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:44,172
I love a party. And parties love me. It's baby time.

46
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:48,272
Mm! Ha!

47
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,844
How 'bout a swiggy for the piggy?

48
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,929
Please.

49
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,414
Careful.

50
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,696
Dear, you should worship too.

51
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,836
Why didn't I think of that? I've
only been pregnant for three years!

52
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,708
From the Cave of Golden Light,

53
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,782
my name is Taiyi Zhen...

54
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:40,016
...ren.

55
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,079
Come on.

56
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:43,850
Wait for me!

57
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,203
Hurry up! Move it, slowpoke! Come on!

58
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:46,852
Yeah, slowpoke!

59
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:47,686
Come on!

60
00:06:53,641 --> 00:06:56,178
A third son! Congratulations!

61
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:58,196
I'll be a matchmaker for the little man.

62
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,227
We wrote him a song. Wanna hear it?

63
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,821
Thank you for your concern and well-wishes, my friends.

64
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:10,383
But for now, please remain calm and quiet.

65
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,344
Just wait for the good news

66
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,375
and we'll alert you...

67
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,782
...as soon as he's here.

68
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:18,914
I can't take it!

69
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,458
He approaches.

70
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,438
Or I think.

71
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,610
Master Immortal, I have something for you...

72
00:07:29,635 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't drink now. That'd be so unprofessional.

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,375
I'll just leave it here.

74
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,735
I have important things to do. Take it away.

75
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:36,549
Hey.

76
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:39,039
Ah, some people just don't listen.

77
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:45,960
Well, one sip can't hurt!

78
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,654
Don't want it going to waste!

79
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:52,117
That's nice.

80
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,563
I mean, I'm basically almost done. So...

81
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:05,630
Enjoy your enchanted three-day nap!

82
00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:08,766
Ah!

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,930
I knew it! A spell was cast, so
only Taiyi would be able to move it.

84
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:28,617
Your highness.

85
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:30,703
The immortal's spell must be cast soon!

86
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:32,446
Has the time come?

87
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:34,031
What's wrong?

88
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,288
He passed out, I think he's drunk.

89
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:37,110
He's what?

90
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:39,375
I guess we'll have to do it the hard way.

91
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:40,727
Now hold on.

92
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,708
We can't just go beating up on the man.

93
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,085
He's an immortal. It's wrong!

94
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,344
Milord! She won't last much longer!

95
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,255
Out of the way!

96
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:01,102
Oh, you wouldn't believe the crazy dream I just had.

97
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,460
I beg you. Open the lotus!

98
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,349
Oh, yeah! I knew there was something I forgot!

99
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,446
OPEN

100
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,186
Go on! Is something wrong?

101
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,708
I can't remember the password.

102
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,333
That was some crazy strong stuff!

103
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,630
Okay, let's see, uh...

104
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,714
No big deal! I have four more tries.

105
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:38,571
What the heck?

106
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,319
And if you're wrong a fifth time?

107
00:09:40,344 --> 00:09:42,875
It locks itself and we can try again in ten years.

108
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,321
Come, out!

109
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:50,406
Milord! The lady has fainted!

110
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:51,417
Oh, I got it!

111
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:51,923
Don't!

112
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:53,047
Is he mad?

113
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:03,235
I just remembered. If you forget the
password, you can just verify with a handprint.

114
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,805
Look over there, it's happy hour!

115
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,625
Huh?

116
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,930
I knew something felt off with you.

117
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,399
Look! A Slave Rune.

118
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:16,787
Huh?

119
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,367
Huh?

120
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,227
He's got control of her!

121
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,977
You want it so badly?

122
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,437
Okay, I'll give one back.

123
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,380
Halt!

124
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,482
Oh, boy.

125
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,914
Milord! I'm not sure what happened but...

126
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:22,055
What?

127
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:55,094
Gotcha!

128
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,537
You're not going anywhere, buddy...

129
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:53,801
Watch out!

130
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,875
Ah, he's getting away.

131
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,938
With the power of sun and moon, of sea
and sand, Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

132
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:21,602
Hold!

133
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,266
Take this, you little demon!

134
00:13:30,312 --> 00:13:31,110
That's my son!

135
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:31,702
No.

136
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,833
That's the reincarnation of
the Demon Pill and he's bad news!

137
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:39,750
If he didn't have the Qiankun Hoop containing him, he'd
unleash a reign of terror like the world's never seen.

138
00:13:43,938 --> 00:13:45,756
Go back where you belong!

139
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:46,500
No!

140
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:51,610
My love!

141
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,551
Please don't hurt him.

142
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,414
Don't hurt my child!

143
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,399
But...

144
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,625
Lord Li!

145
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:02,672
For generations we have battled against demons.

146
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:07,539
Do you think it wise to endanger our
people by letting one live among us?

147
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,867
As the leader of Chentang Pass,

148
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:14,414
I hope you can consider the
greater good and do what's right.

149
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,355
He's over there.

150
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,458
YOU HAVE A SON!

151
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,016
MY CONDOLENCES

152
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,263
You see that?

153
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm here. Don't be scared.

154
00:14:40,417 --> 00:14:42,458
Your Grace. Everyone...

155
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,583
My family is unfortunate. This I know.

156
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,341
But my son is also just a victim of this misfortune.

157
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,255
And I'm not of the mind to kill an innocent child.

158
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,575
I will take care of Ne Zha's education,

159
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,875
and I promise he won't set foot in the village.

160
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,763
If he brings you any harm,

161
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,794
then I will receive your punishment.

162
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,099
I'm willing to pay the ultimate price.

163
00:15:04,568 --> 00:15:05,917
Even if we spare him.

164
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,583
He'll only have three years.

165
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:09,958
The Supreme Lord put a curse on the Pill

166
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,542
so three years from today,

167
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,255
a lightning bolt will strike him and take his life.

168
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:15,615
Oh.

169
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,513
His curse can't be broken.

170
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:20,997
I'll convince him to have it removed.

171
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,162
Don't worry. my darling. I will protect our child.

172
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:02,216
THE DRAGON PALACE

173
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,990
Finally...

174
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:25,435
This is the Spirit Pearl?

175
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:28,323
If I infuse it into an egg...

176
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:32,418
That means my son will be all-powerful.

177
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,218
Unstoppable.

178
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:37,792
And my child will become a god?

179
00:16:37,957 --> 00:16:39,925
You'll never...

180
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,067
Never what?

181
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,278
Fail, sir!

182
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:47,076
Oh, very well.

183
00:17:05,489 --> 00:17:08,042
This is my son, Ao Bing.

184
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:12,771
As agreed, I will entrust him to
you and he shall call you master.

185
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:17,912
On the condition you help free
him from this underwater purgatory.

186
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,948
And he joins Heaven's Court.

187
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,771
I can't...

188
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:22,917
You can't?

189
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,865
...can't be defeated.

190
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:30,482
I'm going to prove to you that you've
put your trust in the most worthy immortal.

191
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,287
Next time...

192
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:36,793
Could you do me a favor and just nod?

193
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,973
That right there is a void portal.

194
00:17:46,177 --> 00:17:49,159
The Supreme Lord entered a realm beyond the three worlds,

195
00:17:49,184 --> 00:17:51,880
so this door is the only way we can get to him.

196
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:57,510
Supreme Lord! It is I! Your disciple, Taiyi.

197
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,114
Taiyi, do you understand what you've done?

198
00:18:01,325 --> 00:18:05,142
Yes, I know I messed up but it's not really
my fault because there was a demon and...

199
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,379
Ah! No excuses!

200
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,359
What took you so long to see me?

201
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,725
I get so bored by myself.

202
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,160
Ah! It's just you.

203
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:16,153
This is Chang ShengYun. He's in charge of the void portal.

204
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:18,059
But we just call him Clingy Cloud.

205
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,700
Oh, yeah? Well, we call you fatty!

206
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:20,903
Hello, new friend.

207
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:23,620
Not in front of company. Treat me with some respect!

208
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,184
And this is Li Jing, Commander of Chengtang Pass.

209
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,137
A pleasure! Really!

210
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:29,809
It's a party! I have company!

211
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,675
Oh, yes, sit, sit! Here, have some tea.

212
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:35,754
It's hard sitting here guarding the gate every day.

213
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,487
So what's new with the mortals?

214
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:39,206
I've been out of the loop for so long.

215
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,875
Please relay to the Supreme Lord.

216
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,458
We seek an audience with him.

217
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:43,895
Huh? I'm sorry but...

218
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,167
Unfortunately, our master and some of
his god pals went to the void portal.

219
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,250
Probably attending to godly matters.

220
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:52,450
But why do you want to see him? Do tell, do tell.

221
00:18:52,482 --> 00:18:55,614
Someone's under a heaven-made
curse, and I want him to call it off.

222
00:18:56,012 --> 00:18:57,167
Say it ain't so!

223
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,167
Then it's useless to speak to him.

224
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,707
That curse is unbreakable.

225
00:19:08,552 --> 00:19:10,692
One day here is a year there.

226
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:14,254
Which means back on earth, a great
deal of time has already passed.

227
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,825
We need to head back as soon as possible.
Maybe there's something we can do for him.

228
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:31,211
These dumb walls crush my soul.

229
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:34,895
Even prisoners get parole.

230
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:39,707
No friends, no fun, it's just the worst.

231
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:42,542
Hopefully boredom will get me first.

232
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,504
Ne Zha. What're you doing up there?

233
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:48,184
Can't go outside and nobody will play with me.

234
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,270
So what else can I do but check out the sights?

235
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,075
Then...

236
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,567
Oh! Why don't you describe the scenery to mommy?

237
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:58,221
Grass, trees, and dumb flowers.

238
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,887
And a guy showing his butt.

239
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,820
Oh, you with your jokes.

240
00:20:02,137 --> 00:20:03,903
Hey. Why don't I play with you?

241
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,142
Don't mess with me.

242
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:07,973
You don't have more demons to fight or something?

243
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,677
This is the first time I've seen you in forever.

244
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,746
You never have time to play.

245
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,785
I know. I know this is hard.

246
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,262
I would love to play more, baby,

247
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,364
however the fortress needs protecting.

248
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,267
I can't be everywhere at once.

249
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:23,137
Uh...

250
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:25,106
But today has been peaceful.

251
00:20:25,372 --> 00:20:27,637
How does playing Jianzi sound to you?

252
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:32,731
Well since you're so bored I guess I can play with you.

253
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:39,114
Ready? Go!

254
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:49,375
Milady. I think you should put your armor on.

255
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:50,473
You must be joking.

256
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,135
He is my son and we're playing.

257
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,879
Nobody's died from Jianzi.

258
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,301
Catch...

259
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:56,473
...this!

260
00:20:56,598 --> 00:20:57,387
Ready...

261
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,425
Uh, you okay, ma?

262
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,629
I'm fine! I'm fine!

263
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,542
Good shot!

264
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,317
On second thought...

265
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:08,043
Did I kick it too hard?

266
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,653
No. Kick as hard as you want!

267
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,333
You two, join in.

268
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,489
Maybe you should rest.

269
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:28,864
No. I'm alright.

270
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,309
Look at how much fun Ne Zha's having.

271
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:38,308
It's been a long time since he smiled like that.

272
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,934
That's wonderful for him, milady.

273
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:43,918
Report!

274
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,104
An eel spirit's destroying the eastern
fishing village. We need reinforcements.

275
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,512
Mom, catch!

276
00:21:58,377 --> 00:21:59,223
Sweetie...

277
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,731
We're going to have to call it a day.

278
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:03,715
But next time...

279
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:06,473
We can play as long as you want.

280
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:07,887
I promise.

281
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,473
That's what you said last time.

282
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,729
It's fine. I'm used to it by now.

283
00:22:12,754 --> 00:22:14,473
I'll cook your favorite when I come home!

284
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,317
Huh?

285
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:44,781
Huh?

286
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,007
And you two.

287
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:56,693
Master Immortal Taiyi brought
you here to protect the barrier,

288
00:22:56,718 --> 00:22:58,639
not so you can be flashy mascots.

289
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:00,601
Do not allow him to get out anymore.

290
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,498
Don't worry. I guarded the southern boundary.

291
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:05,670
And it's his fault Ne Zha got out last time.

292
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:08,625
You are so f-full of it! The north was secured.

293
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,851
He's clearly guilty. Just look at this guy!

294
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:13,217
Huh? You turn that finger around!

295
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,601
Once Taiyi Zhenren returns, you just wait!

296
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,217
Cause I'm sure he loves to hear you whine!

297
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:20,975
That's it! Fight me. Come on, you wanna go?

298
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,586
Bring it! I ain't scared!

299
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,240
Oh, yeah, chicken?

300
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:24,960
Chicken? You are!

301
00:23:25,375 --> 00:23:26,093
Cut it...

302
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,203
I'll show you a chicken.

303
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,792
Who's the chicken? Chicken says "what?"

304
00:23:30,817 --> 00:23:31,445
Huh?

305
00:23:31,484 --> 00:23:32,023
Huh?

306
00:23:42,317 --> 00:23:42,975
Huh?

307
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:47,632
Huh? What? Whatcha lookin' at?

308
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:49,745
Huh?

309
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,936
What's the big idea...

310
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:06,739
Body Slam!

311
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,827
Dragon Whip!

312
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:12,663
Crabby Sea Monster!

313
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,225
Immortal Picking Grapes!

314
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:18,921
Come on, Dad!

315
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:22,093
One!

316
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,944
Two!

317
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,984
He's out again!

318
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,417
Three!

319
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,272
Four!

320
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,554
Five.

321
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:44,616
Six!

322
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:47,208
Seven!

323
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:49,647
Eight.

324
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,375
Nine!

325
00:24:54,347 --> 00:24:55,343
Ten.

326
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:57,528
Ready or not...

327
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:35,999
Huh?

328
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,429
I've had enough.

329
00:25:49,454 --> 00:25:50,371
Let's fight.

330
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,833
But boss. There's no way we can beat Ne Zha.

331
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,639
Not true!

332
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:57,818
Are we, or are we not The Demon hunters Gang?

333
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,757
Until we can figure out a way... no one goes home!

334
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:02,632
Huh?

335
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,554
I have a way, boss!

336
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,417
Huh? I told you to keep guard.

337
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:10,218
Go back.

338
00:26:10,243 --> 00:26:13,007
I was thinking we could set some traps.

339
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,917
Like what?

340
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,413
Check this out!

341
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:20,671
Ne Zha's gonna come down that bridge,
but he won't know I cut the ropes...

342
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:21,265
And bam!

343
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:21,901
Ah!

344
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:27,882
When he hits the ground, it'll trigger the second
trap, an overhead basket filled with sharp pointy objects!

345
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:31,069
He'll reach for the nearest
shield, which will be an old pan.

346
00:26:31,102 --> 00:26:34,475
But surprise! There's another trap within that trap!

347
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:39,841
He'll run and run and run... And
"What's that? A safe space to hide?"

348
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,694
But not so fast...

349
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:43,749
Lift-off!

350
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:45,014
Boom!

351
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,250
But better watch out... For that venomous snake!

352
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,622
And he'll start climbing the rope ladder near the tree.

353
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:56,616
Which should make all those hornets in
the hornet's nest I put there really mad.

354
00:26:57,085 --> 00:27:02,700
If he doesn't want to get stung so bad his head swells
like a balloon, he'll have to jump into the mud pit.

355
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:07,835
And when he finally crawls out, he'll be so
scared and angry smoke will come out of his ears.

356
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:10,250
Nice! I never noticed how clever you were.

357
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,375
I'd have to be smart to hang out with someone like you.

358
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,375
You know, when you're right, you're right.

359
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,343
But he needs something way worse.

360
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:21,161
I got it, let's add some sea urchins to the pit!

361
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:24,218
That'll do the trick. It's
important for him to stay hydrated.

362
00:27:25,655 --> 00:27:28,811
Um, guys? You don't think that's too mean?

363
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,568
Huh? He's mean.

364
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:33,167
He humiliates us, so we're just returning the favor.

365
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:33,820
Yeah. That's right!

366
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:34,804
Yeah. Exactly.

367
00:27:34,936 --> 00:27:37,538
All right. Well you're the boss.

368
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:39,046
Who am I to disagree?

369
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:42,124
Hold on. I just had an important thought.

370
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:42,874
What is it?

371
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:46,436
If our plan starts with Ne Zha on
the bridge, how do we get him there?

372
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:47,663
That part's easy.

373
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,593
We can scare him onto it.

374
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,569
Like how?

375
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:52,499
Like...

376
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,750
You were right about one thing.

377
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,179
It's important to stay hydrated!

378
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,866
You guys! You guys!

379
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:28,608
He beat me up.

380
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:30,382
And he took all my clothes!

381
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:32,593
Well fellas, it's been real.

382
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:34,499
You guys are a lot of fun.

383
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,389
Yeah? Laugh all you want.

384
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,710
You demon!

385
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:42,737
What did you just call me?

386
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,366
I said...

387
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:47,514
You're a demon!

388
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:11,874
Ne Zha!

389
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,370
That'll be enough of that.

390
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,812
Boundary Beasts!

391
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:17,211
Sir!

392
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,108
Tighten the boundary.

393
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,500
He's now prohibited from setting foot outside this room.

394
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,304
Sir!

395
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:34,701
Enough.

396
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:42,179
We expected this might happen one day.

397
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:44,858
We tried but...

398
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,944
maybe this is just his fate.

399
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:53,171
Even after forbidding them from mentioning the word demon,

400
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,811
people will never see him as anything but.

401
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,718
And I've been so busy fighting
monsters to gain goodwill on his behalf.

402
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,983
I've neglected my boy.

403
00:30:04,092 --> 00:30:06,182
He only has two years left.

404
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,562
Let's resign our positions.

405
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,671
Take him to play in the mountains, and just be with him.

406
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,398
Until the end.

407
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:23,726
Uh, Lady Yin? This is on me.

408
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,468
So I've decided to take him on as an apprentice.

409
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:30,585
I'll shape the Demon Pill into a
demon-fighting warrior of justice.

410
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,429
Is that our only option?

411
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:35,175
To put him through all that?

412
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,296
Shouldn't we just let him enjoy the time he's got?

413
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,538
I do not wish to rob him of a meaningful life.

414
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,578
And would you want this?

415
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,835
For him to be remembered as a demon?

416
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,725
Master Ne Zha!

417
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:57,734
Time for breakfast.

418
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:03,734
Huh?

419
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,639
The young Master's escaped again.

420
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,617
What? Oh, no!

421
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,210
What?

422
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,406
That's impossible.

423
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:15,767
Mm-hm.

424
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:16,761
I agree.

425
00:31:16,785 --> 00:31:17,583
Don't stand there!

426
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,078
Report this to Master Li.

427
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:22,222
You can count on me!

428
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:23,140
I'm on it.

429
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,257
There's no guard alive...

430
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:30,562
who can keep me locked up.

431
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:35,906
Huh?

432
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,578
Wha--

433
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:42,320
Eh?

434
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,343
Woah.

435
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:13,906
Welcome to the world Inside the painting. Scenic isn't it?

436
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:15,279
What's the big id--

437
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:17,433
Ah-da-da. Hold onto your socks.

438
00:32:17,554 --> 00:32:19,773
I'm about to show you a little somethin'.

439
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:27,640
With one stroke, you can change the painting
to reflect whatever your little heart desires!

440
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,092
You've got a brush. Big deal!

441
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:33,640
Why don't you just sit back
and watch this bad boy in action!

442
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:35,570
Do your thing, brush!

443
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,117
No, no, no.

444
00:33:37,023 --> 00:33:38,843
Wow!

445
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:44,078
Young apprentice, we haven't even started!

446
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,148
Wow...

447
00:34:10,695 --> 00:34:12,562
Mighty impressive, huh?

448
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:17,531
Just think, you can spend every day here
learning the Immortal magic of Kunlun with me.

449
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,687
Go ahead. Call me master, I know you're impressed.

450
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:21,742
Master?

451
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,601
<i>What could I learn from you?</i>

452
00:34:26,078 --> 00:34:29,773
Huh? Why you-- You're in trouble now.

453
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:32,906
On my command, one, two, change!

454
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:38,054
Look out.

455
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,796
Magic'd!

456
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,176
Huh?

457
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,835
That's my handy-dandy disguising spell.

458
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,805
Wanna learn it?

459
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:47,671
Yeah!

460
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,328
This looks yummy.

461
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:58,375
So can you make me look all big and scary?

462
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:00,289
Now what would I go and do all that for?

463
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:02,906
Also, that's next-level stuff, even I can't pull that off.

464
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,882
Don't get fancy, learn the basics.

465
00:35:04,992 --> 00:35:05,967
Come on little guy.

466
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:07,570
Your master's gonna teach you...

467
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,417
That's easy. Teach me something cooler.

468
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,560
The disguising spell is the most basic.

469
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:17,828
If you won't learn that then I won't even bother!

470
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:20,958
Fine. Watch me knock this out.

471
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,039
On my command! Change!

472
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:25,980
Change!

473
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:27,976
Change!

474
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:31,609
The disguising spell isn't even remotely basic.

475
00:35:31,835 --> 00:35:35,265
Took me six whole months to master my first disguise.

476
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:38,593
Knock yourself out, take your time.

477
00:35:39,656 --> 00:35:42,750
AN IMMORTAL PREPARES

478
00:35:51,195 --> 00:35:52,929
Master? Master.

479
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,812
Lady Yin. What a nice surprise.

480
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:00,140
I'm checking on Ne Zha.

481
00:36:00,195 --> 00:36:02,093
I'm just teaching him some stuff.

482
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:03,268
Where is my son?

483
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, right there...

484
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:06,936
Huh?

485
00:36:08,312 --> 00:36:10,148
Hang on. What is that?

486
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:14,023
Ah! Hang on, kid.

487
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,968
I'll save you.

488
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:30,585
Ne Zha. What happened?

489
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,531
What is this?

490
00:36:32,585 --> 00:36:35,445
Huh? I didn't do that! I promise you!

491
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:36,953
How'd this happen?

492
00:36:37,484 --> 00:36:38,828
Oh, good, he has a pulse.

493
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:58,414
Oh! Oh, no! It's poisonous.

494
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,792
You should treat me with more respect.

495
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,842
How'd you master that spell so quickly?

496
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,804
I don't know, by being super awesome?

497
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:19,539
Okay, don't get jealous.

498
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:22,453
Even though it took him one day what took you six months.

499
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:26,031
Share your trick with your beloved master?

500
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:28,906
Teach me more Immortal Magic and I'll tell you.

501
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:30,406
Yep! You got it, kid!

502
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:33,960
Since your element is fire, I'll teach you fire control.

503
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:37,382
Tongue of flame. Sands of time.
Unleash heat from the holy shrine.

504
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:39,179
Make it so!

505
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,958
Not cool, that got in my eye.

506
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:48,735
I can't say this spell right with my tongue all swollen.

507
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,266
Aha! Good thing I have an anti-venom pill in my pants.

508
00:37:55,353 --> 00:37:57,292
<i>Oh, I can't reach it.</i>

509
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,492
Can you get it for me, little guy, please?

510
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:00,658
No problem.

511
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:04,408
Whoa! You've got like treasure pants!

512
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:07,656
Huh? What's this weird moppy thingy?

513
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,142
It's for flies.

514
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:13,039
What? What about this shiny thing?

515
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:14,853
That's a fire-tipped spear.

516
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,808
A fire-tipped spear, huh?

517
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,958
Hey, don't touch that switch.

518
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,853
You mean this switch?

519
00:38:24,822 --> 00:38:25,322
Huh? Ha?

520
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:26,345


521
00:38:34,667 --> 00:38:37,080
Ne Zha! Are you causing trouble again?

522
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:45,369
Your grace! Are you all right?

523
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,541
I'm an immortal, I can't get hurt, but thanks.

524
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:51,510
Ne Zha. If you show me respect,

525
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,000
the things I'll teach you...

526
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:55,727
Like banishing demons and defeating monsters.

527
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,689
What? Banish demons? And defeat monsters?

528
00:38:58,939 --> 00:39:02,080
Nice try! Like I'd ever learn anything from you.

529
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,392
How do I get out of here?

530
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:05,408
Well you'll have to use this little landscape brush,

531
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:08,167
if you wish to escape from the painting.

532
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:09,695
Oh, wait a minute.

533
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,797
You want to keep me locked up in here.

534
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:12,986
No don't be silly.

535
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,735
A place this lovely could never be a prison, dear.

536
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,408
It's a "training retreat.”

537
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:19,900
So I train and they'd still hate me anyway.

538
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,330
I'd be better off just taking a nap.

539
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:26,595
Ne Zha. I'm your mother.

540
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:30,955
I know you. I know you want the others to accept you.

541
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:34,697
But you feel more and more
alone every time they rejected you.

542
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,377
And you resent them for that.

543
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,174
Young master?

544
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:45,306
How did he get out again? Young master?

545
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:47,408
Huh?

546
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,197
Hi, you wanna play?

547
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:57,000
Mm-hm!

548
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,470
Ne Zha!

549
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:02,352
I thought he was locked away!

550
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:03,197
They let him out!

551
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:05,361
Everyone run!

552
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:16,908
Go back to where you came from!

553
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:17,443
Yeah!

554
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,689
Little demon brat!

555
00:40:18,714 --> 00:40:19,857
No one likes you!

556
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:21,110
You're a Demon!

557
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:22,299
Yeah, no one wants you here!

558
00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:23,174
Go away!

559
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,752
You've been through a lot, but it will be alright.

560
00:40:31,025 --> 00:40:34,650
After your training you'll be able to banish demons

561
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,583
with us and earn their admiration.

562
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,369
Why would I do anything for them? Never!

563
00:40:39,408 --> 00:40:40,877
They wanna see me as a demon?

564
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,845
I'll show them what a demon really looks like!

565
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:44,095
Dear, you...

566
00:40:47,833 --> 00:40:50,494
I guess it's time we tell you the truth.

567
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:53,736
The secret we've kept for so long.

568
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,908
Why they're so afraid.

569
00:40:58,127 --> 00:40:59,517
You are actually...

570
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:01,541
The Spirit, what?

571
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,049
Oh. right, right. right!

572
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:06,291
The reincarnation!

573
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:09,806
And it's that divine strength they find so intimidating.

574
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:12,814
Are you... lying?

575
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,345
Use your head.

576
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,167
Your father and I are humans.

577
00:41:17,228 --> 00:41:19,158
How could we give birth to a demon?

578
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:22,274
Then, why don't you just tell them I'm the Spirit Pearl?

579
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,417
The Spirit Pearl was a secret weapon

580
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,861
the Supreme Lord sent down to the mortal realm.

581
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,938
It's not called an "everyone knows about it" weapon.

582
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,924
They couldn't handle the truth.

583
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:33,752
The truth...

584
00:41:34,947 --> 00:41:36,994
In the meantime, try to win their hearts.

585
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:40,167
Treat them as if they're family. Keep them safe from harm,

586
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:44,150
and they'll surely return the favor,
embracing you as one of their own.

587
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,125
TWO YEARS LATER

588
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,931
Total piece of cake.

589
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:22,010
No, no, no. Way too impulsive.

590
00:42:27,333 --> 00:42:28,502
Show him, go on.

591
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,580
Stop there.

592
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,666
Yummy human!

593
00:42:57,547 --> 00:42:58,502
See here?

594
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:05,572
And here too.

595
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,291
Look at that. You harmed all those innocent
civilians, just to destroy a couple skeletons.

596
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,056
Yeah, they're not even real though.

597
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:18,252
What's the big deal.

598
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,674
If you can't do the right thing in training,

599
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,892
how can we trust you in the real world.

600
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:26,072
Your Grace, take away his Chaotic Silk and spear.

601
00:43:26,283 --> 00:43:29,556
Until he learns self-control, he's
banned from such powerful weapons.

602
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:32,760
Fine, so take it back. See if I care!

603
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,845
I've learned all your Immortal
Magic, so I can go kick demon butt.

604
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:36,533
No way.

605
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:40,806
In fact, from now on your only
focus will be meditation not fighting.

606
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:45,064
What? You wanted me to learn how
to fight monsters. Well I did that!

607
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,180
Oh, why won't you let me out of here?

608
00:43:47,205 --> 00:43:49,158
You're not leaving here 'til I say so.

609
00:43:52,283 --> 00:43:53,166
Yeah, whatever.

610
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:55,181
I'd like to see you try and stop me.

611
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,420
Huh, how'd he get that?

612
00:43:56,444 --> 00:43:57,017
Ne Zha!

613
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,572
Don't worry, I got this!

614
00:43:59,775 --> 00:44:01,549
They're gonna love me!

615
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:49,517
I'm so sick of seafood. But it's good to change things up.

616
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,533
Yo, demon!

617
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:55,433
Let go of that dog!

618
00:44:55,603 --> 00:44:56,338
Huh?

619
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:57,744
Huh?

620
00:45:01,252 --> 00:45:03,688
What, you want me to eat you instead?

621
00:45:03,713 --> 00:45:04,767
Right here!

622
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,744
Why...

623
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:12,986
Huh?

624
00:45:13,301 --> 00:45:14,205
Huh?

625
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:26,370
Oh, no, you don't!

626
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:47,470
Huh?

627
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,095
Get out here!

628
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,525
Show your face!

629
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:57,588
Stop!

630
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,822
Turn around and watch this!

631
00:46:00,986 --> 00:46:04,916
Come out! Stop hiding!

632
00:46:06,892 --> 00:46:10,681
Be like that. Guess I'll have to smoke you out!

633
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:17,100
How horrible!

634
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:18,314
Ne Zha's gone mad!

635
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,424
Hey! Where you think you're goin'?

636
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,158
Ready? It's coming!

637
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:43,572
Huh?

638
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,470
Ne Zha kidnapped Yaya!

639
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,049
Good luck catching me in the sea, puny human!

640
00:47:15,556 --> 00:47:17,939
I've frozen the sea for half a kilometer.

641
00:47:18,128 --> 00:47:19,336
You can't escape.

642
00:47:22,979 --> 00:47:25,298
Demon, let the girl go.

643
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:28,181
Why should I listen to you?

644
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,197
Stay back, child. I'm here to save her.

645
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:32,603
I'm not a child!

646
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,361
You should surrender.

647
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:49,792
Wrong choice.

648
00:47:53,658 --> 00:47:55,455
Back off and get in line, weirdo!

649
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,578
I saw this guy first!

650
00:47:56,603 --> 00:47:58,994
What... what on earth are you doing?

651
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:00,588
Huh?

652
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:03,000
Wait your turn! I'll kick your butt next!

653
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,728
Where are you paren...

654
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,213
Town's only big enough for one cool guy.

655
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:15,049
Hey, demon! Let that girl go!

656
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:16,479
Huh?

657
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:19,931
There's something different about you.

658
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,658
Whatever!

659
00:48:34,142 --> 00:48:37,463
Ow, let go! I said let go!

660
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,375
Huh? Woah, you have horns!

661
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,033
Huh.

662
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:16,392
Huh, bubbles?

663
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:20,775
What's goin' on?

664
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:23,100
Take a good look around you.

665
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:27,924
I should thank you both for giving
me time to unleash my special attack.

666
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,353
Go on, make a move. Not so tough now, huh?

667
00:49:31,416 --> 00:49:33,838
I can finally have my dinner in peace.

668
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:38,611
Hey, spit her out!

669
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:41,283
When I get done with you, you'll wish that you...

670
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,002
You don't look so good.

671
00:49:53,027 --> 00:49:55,025
Uh-oh, my spit gotcha!

672
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:58,252
Seems like you hit "rock bottom".

673
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,049
Maybe in your next life

674
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:05,197
you'll learn to mind your own business.

675
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:11,119
Huh?

676
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,501
Bring it on, kid!

677
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:56,854
Please have mercy!

678
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:58,518
I'll give you the antidote!

679
00:50:58,909 --> 00:50:59,760
Antidote?

680
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,080
Don't worry. It's enough.

681
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:19,565
It tastes like garlic!

682
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:23,604
Huh? Look at that!

683
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:26,268
How'll they drink? Their mouths can't move!

684
00:51:27,088 --> 00:51:29,736
Uh, you can also apply it to the skin.

685
00:51:32,604 --> 00:51:34,877
Why didn't you say so?

686
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:38,150
Well, because you didn't ask.

687
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,275
That's right, spread it evenly.

688
00:51:43,672 --> 00:51:46,104
You have to really massage it in.

689
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:47,900
The skin'll absorb it faster.

690
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,002
Plus, it makes the complexion all dewy!

691
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:15,123
Wait

692
00:52:15,147 --> 00:52:15,783
Huh? I

693
00:52:16,143 --> 00:52:17,508
Spare me.

694
00:52:17,533 --> 00:52:19,705
I just wanted a snack.

695
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,500
I didn't eat a person.

696
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,885
You gave us the antidote. So I'm grateful.

697
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,494
But if you try to do evil in the future,

698
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,875
I won't spare you again.

699
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,283
Okay, okay.

700
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,458
Hey, you! Boy!

701
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,963
What? Still wanna fight?

702
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:36,033
That's not fair to you.

703
00:52:36,058 --> 00:52:38,166
Huh? I'm no match for you?

704
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,333
Come on then. Show me what you got.

705
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,748
Thank you for saving me.

706
00:52:41,913 --> 00:52:42,433
Huh?

707
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,119
And for saving this girl as well.

708
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,205
Today you were my ally.

709
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:48,892
I will find a way to repay the kindness you've shown.

710
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:50,502
Nah, it was nothin'.

711
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:53,463
I was simply following the will of Heaven.

712
00:52:53,583 --> 00:52:57,229
Cause I was destined to be a great demon slayer!

713
00:53:00,815 --> 00:53:03,354
You're not afraid of me?

714
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:06,463
You save Yaya from bad guy.

715
00:53:33,588 --> 00:53:35,658
Hm. Huh?

716
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,236
Hey. What's wrong?

717
00:54:22,299 --> 00:54:25,299
It's nothing. Just got eyes in my sand.

718
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:27,494
You mean sand in your eyes?

719
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:30,041
Let me see. I can get it out for you.

720
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:36,916
Aw man! This is so embarrassing!

721
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,713
Okay, fine!

722
00:54:38,744 --> 00:54:40,979
My mom's the only other person who'll play this with me.

723
00:54:41,004 --> 00:54:43,236
So I got emotional. Big deal!

724
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:49,408
Huh?

725
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,143
We're friends now.

726
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:54,072
If you want to play again,
come to the shore and blow this.

727
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:57,182
When I hear the conch shell, I'll come from wherever I am.

728
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,971
I forgot. I'm Ao Bing.

729
00:54:59,135 --> 00:54:59,854
And you?

730
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,940
My name's Ne Zha!

731
00:55:03,712 --> 00:55:04,696
Your friends?

732
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:05,846
What?

733
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:12,385
Huh?

734
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,361
There's Ne Zha. He kidnapped Yaya!

735
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:21,143
The demon!

736
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:23,125
My baby! Oh, Yaya!

737
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,667
Yaya! How are you feeling?

738
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,292
Ne Zha hit. Pow, pow, pow!

739
00:55:27,292 --> 00:55:29,190
Demon go, boom, boom!

740
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,213
Why would you kidnap a little girl!?

741
00:55:31,432 --> 00:55:32,400
That's not what happened!

742
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,666
If I hadn't chased that thing down,
she would've been demon-food already.

743
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,041
So where's the demon then? Did you see one?

744
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:38,885
How about you?

745
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,750
Do you seriously think we're that dumb?

746
00:55:40,775 --> 00:55:41,389
Yeah?

747
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:42,010
Yeah!

748
00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:43,947
You won't get away with this!

749
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:49,705
Okay, I see.

750
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:54,994
Go away, you demon brat!

751
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:02,415
You wanna say that again?

752
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:04,479
Stop it!

753
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:13,385
See? He's a monster!

754
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:15,486
We'll kill you!

755
00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:16,439
Die, demon!

756
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,760
Your master has arrived.

757
00:56:46,898 --> 00:56:48,231
Stop hurting people.

758
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:53,673
Ne Zha.

759
00:56:56,104 --> 00:56:57,666
Commander Li!

760
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:00,736
Ne Zha burned down the village, kidnapped a child,

761
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,807
and attacked the villagers. We demand he be punished.

762
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:08,221
My crimes? I'm gonna show you a real crime!

763
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,042
Ne Zha, don't.

764
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:22,815
Lord Li, you must lock this demon-child up.

765
00:57:22,877 --> 00:57:25,166
Never again to see the light of day.

766
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:27,682
Lock him up! And throw away the key!

767
00:57:28,127 --> 00:57:28,917
Lord Li,

768
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:31,142
you must get your son under control!

769
00:57:31,167 --> 00:57:32,518
We'd thank you!

770
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,658
Father... Master.

771
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,468
How did today's assignment go?

772
00:57:55,525 --> 00:57:58,494
I made seven lesser revolutions and four greater ones.

773
00:57:58,658 --> 00:58:01,500
I learned to ice over rivers and create frost and snow.

774
00:58:01,596 --> 00:58:04,167
I've reached the seventh heaven of the Ice Jade.

775
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:07,533
Also... I made a friend.

776
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,375
I met him near the seashore.

777
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,674
Wha-- what do you mean a friend?

778
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:14,080
You can't reveal your identity.

779
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:16,643
He was a human, but he didn't care what I was.

780
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:17,741
Because I'm his friend.

781
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,158
And who was this person?

782
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:21,525
His name was... Ne Zha.

783
00:58:21,917 --> 00:58:22,752
Huh?

784
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:28,619
Sma... small world, apprentice.

785
00:58:28,846 --> 00:58:31,330
Sounds like you just met the Demon Pill.

786
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:32,350
Oh, no.

787
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:33,322
Ne Zha...

788
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:35,298
is your sworn rival.

789
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:38,190
We've waited three whole years.

790
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:43,119
On the day the reckoning occurs, the
Demon Pill will begin a mama... massacre...

791
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:45,708
and then you will rescue Chentang Pass

792
00:58:45,744 --> 00:58:49,408
and claim your birthright as the Spirit Pearl.

793
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:53,315
Master, might he be granted redemption?

794
00:58:54,533 --> 00:58:56,979
In the times of antiquity,

795
00:58:57,292 --> 00:59:02,682
we dragons were all-powerful
beings, revered and worshipped.

796
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:08,135
On behalf of Heaven, we fought
monsters, subduing them in the ocean,

797
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,666
earning us the title of Dragon Kings.

798
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,369
Do you understand

799
00:59:13,395 --> 00:59:15,650
what this place really is?

800
00:59:15,706 --> 00:59:16,838
Our Palace, right?

801
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:23,900
Beneath the magma of this volcano are the
countless creatures we defeated those many years ago

802
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,713
at the request of the Supreme Lord.

803
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:32,307
"Dragon Palace"?

804
00:59:33,761 --> 00:59:37,854
It's as much our prison as it is theirs.

805
00:59:39,213 --> 00:59:45,838
If we were to leave this place, the monsters
would break free of their imprisonment and escape.

806
00:59:45,947 --> 00:59:53,041
Do you see now, son? They tricked us
into doing their dirty work for them.

807
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,666
After all.

808
00:59:55,127 --> 01:00:00,736
What were we to Heaven other than
just monsters to be locked away.

809
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:04,197
The title "King" they gave us?

810
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:10,307
It's laughable. I am nothing more
than another prisoner in this pit.

811
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:15,322
We sealed our fate the moment we took them at their word.

812
01:00:15,432 --> 01:00:23,174
So, my boy, for the past millennium, the
Spirit Pearl has been our only hope for freedom.

813
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,820
In one year's time,

814
01:00:25,236 --> 01:00:31,583
I'll be able to completely remove the horns on
your head and hide your identity as a Dada... dragon.

815
01:00:31,977 --> 01:00:34,525
If you're victorious on the day of reckoning.

816
01:00:34,713 --> 01:00:38,361
Then and only then will you win a place in Heaven,

817
01:00:38,424 --> 01:00:42,979
and be able to break the dragons
free of this underwater purgatory.

818
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:48,578
Our fate rests entirely on your shoulders.

819
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:50,916
Don't let yourself be fooled

820
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:53,854
by the illusion of friendship.

821
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:01,682
I'm a scary demon.

822
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,299
Better run and hide.

823
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,549
Legend says I'll eat and eat,

824
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:09,408
'Til everyone has died

825
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,221
And they're right You should steer clear.

826
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,947
Best take their suggestion

827
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,260
Cause when I eat too much,

828
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:19,963
I get real bad indigestion.

829
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,821
Please eat. You haven't had anything in three days.

830
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:40,665
Dear. How long are you going to be like this?

831
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:41,917
Leave me alone.

832
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:44,367
I just wanna die in peace.

833
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:46,875
I try to help but no one cares so honestly why bother?

834
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:48,751
Isn't Jianzi your favorite, huh?

835
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,293
I could play with you right now.

836
01:01:50,337 --> 01:01:51,583
I'm tired Of being a burden to

837
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:55,907
I've designed a really neat new training
course in your painting called Ride the Clouds.

838
01:01:56,056 --> 01:01:57,321
Wanna give it a try?

839
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,728
I'll close my eyes And disappear.

840
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,833
Hey! Your third birthday's only ten days away.

841
01:02:12,907 --> 01:02:15,696
The people of Chentang Pass want to celebrate with you.

842
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:16,650
Yeah?

843
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:23,375
They'd celebrate my funeral. Not my birthday.

844
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:30,462
The Sea Yaksha can move as water, without being noticed.

845
01:02:30,564 --> 01:02:33,837
It's saliva can petrify people and leaves a residue.

846
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,962
That misunderstanding has been resolved.

847
01:02:37,282 --> 01:02:39,243
They know you drove off the demon.

848
01:02:39,439 --> 01:02:41,083
Oh! Yes, your father's right.

849
01:02:41,165 --> 01:02:44,165
The celebration's the thank
you for defeating that monster.

850
01:02:44,667 --> 01:02:45,868
It would be.

851
01:02:45,958 --> 01:02:48,056
I see my teachings have paid off!

852
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,931
Now those morons get it.

853
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,642
About time.

854
01:02:52,743 --> 01:02:53,751
Promise you'll be there?

855
01:02:53,928 --> 01:02:55,040
All right, fine!

856
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:19,110
Why did you lie about his birthday?

857
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,344
Believing he's the Spirit Pearl

858
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,618
has given him joy.

859
01:03:25,042 --> 01:03:26,875
If it means he can stay that way,

860
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,477
then yes, I'm going to lie.

861
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:29,649
Well, except...

862
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,517
the villagers were clear they want to lock him up.

863
01:03:32,962 --> 01:03:34,571
Why would they attend his party?

864
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:38,917
Let me handle the details.

865
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,352
On the beach that day,

866
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,626
I saw the Yaksha slime on his hands.

867
01:03:42,821 --> 01:03:44,282
He was telling the truth.

868
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:47,977
And I will see to it that they
all learn that, at the celebration.

869
01:03:48,396 --> 01:03:49,071
But...

870
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,618
When you've been commander as long as I have,

871
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,618
many people owe you favors.

872
01:03:54,813 --> 01:03:57,930
I'll get them all to attend. You can count on that.

873
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,422
Don't worry.

874
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:24,110
What do you want?

875
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:26,801
Ah, don't scare me like that.

876
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:31,899
My birthday party's in ten days. And
everyone in the Pass is gonna be there.

877
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,735
I uh, drew you a map so you wouldn't get lost.

878
01:04:38,528 --> 01:04:39,774
Li Manor's renowned.

879
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,266
I guess. But you're coming, aren't ya?

880
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:43,274
Well...

881
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,227
Oh, come on!

882
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,157
I don't care if they don't come but you gotta be there!

883
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:48,267
Why's that?

884
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:50,532
Maybe 'cause you're my only friend.

885
01:04:54,403 --> 01:04:55,987
You're my only friend, too.

886
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:59,000
Do you have any other wishes?

887
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:03,258
You saved my life. So I'll do
everything I can to make them come true.

888
01:05:04,211 --> 01:05:06,462
Wishes? Eh, like I said!

889
01:05:06,524 --> 01:05:08,391
My wish is you'd come to my party!

890
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:11,149
I'll go.

891
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,266
It's a deal! See you there!

892
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:20,757
Don't bail!

893
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:21,954
I won't.

894
01:05:29,027 --> 01:05:30,860
INVITATION

895
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:38,378
Ao Bing,

896
01:05:39,398 --> 01:05:41,235
It's time to go.

897
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:43,198
One more thing.

898
01:05:50,484 --> 01:05:51,383
Father!

899
01:05:59,439 --> 01:06:00,641
Wait, what're you--

900
01:06:27,687 --> 01:06:28,828
My son...

901
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:35,008
Each of the dragons has given you
their hardest scale for protection.

902
01:06:35,446 --> 01:06:39,087
Dragon scale armor is impenetrable.

903
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,579
It's all up to you now.

904
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,071
Huh? Why're you so sad? Show enthusiasm. Smile.

905
01:07:11,324 --> 01:07:13,199
Why does it sound like a funeral?

906
01:07:19,813 --> 01:07:21,790
When does Lord Li want us to come out?

907
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:22,870
He'll signal.

908
01:07:23,055 --> 01:07:24,083
Oh.

909
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:32,508
Hmm. Yeah, I'm feelin' this cape.

910
01:07:32,641 --> 01:07:34,001
Fancy!

911
01:07:35,856 --> 01:07:38,649
A good shroud for a corpse maybe.

912
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:39,563
What?

913
01:07:40,368 --> 01:07:42,883
I am your ma-mast...

914
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,858
Ew, gross, a demon!

915
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:47,907
Stop! I know your master!

916
01:07:47,932 --> 01:07:50,079
So I'm a friend to you!

917
01:07:50,344 --> 01:07:53,212
Oh. Your name is Shen something, right?

918
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:55,337
Shen Go-go-go--

919
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:56,751
What up, Shen Gonggong?

920
01:07:56,776 --> 01:07:59,946
Brat. It's Shen Go-go-gong-bao!

921
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:03,719
And I'm here to reveal your true identity.

922
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:05,844
What do you mean "true"?

923
01:08:07,312 --> 01:08:09,094
Oh, my poor child.

924
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:13,368
You have been kept in the dark for far too long.

925
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:21,993
And now let's bring out the birthday boy!

926
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:33,672
Play with me!

927
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:34,477
Huh?

928
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:43,118
Today is your birthday, young apprentice.

929
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:46,196
And let me tell you I'm gonna spoil you rotten!

930
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:03,954
Your fire-tipped spear and Chaotic
Silk. They're officially yours now.

931
01:09:04,446 --> 01:09:05,961
And here's the big one!

932
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:12,321
This shall serve as your noble steed.

933
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:14,125
Go on, touch it.

934
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:31,586
This guy's my most prized possession. It can transform
into various mounts based on the traits of its owners.

935
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:34,852
With you, it will take the form of a flaming chariot!

936
01:09:36,289 --> 01:09:39,225
So why does it turn into a pig with you then?

937
01:09:39,250 --> 01:09:39,829
Huh?

938
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:51,844
You stinker. Where has the time gone?

939
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:55,126
Just three years ago, you were
a little meatball in my belly.

940
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:58,501
And now you've become a man with a personality and...

941
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,704
I so want to watch you grow up.

942
01:10:08,649 --> 01:10:12,040
Why are you talking like that on his birthday?

943
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,258
Dad got you a protection charm to keep you safe.

944
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:16,594
SAFE AND SOUND

945
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:20,438
I know I've always been hard on
you, and you're angry about that.

946
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,712
But I was doing what I thought best.

947
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:26,167
Now son, you have a long life ahead.

948
01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:28,587
Do not pay any attention to what the others say.

949
01:10:28,755 --> 01:10:30,735
You are who you say you are.

950
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:32,992
That's all that matters.

951
01:10:34,587 --> 01:10:35,977
I believed you.

952
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,446
But all you've done was lie to me.

953
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:40,422
Why are you saying that?

954
01:10:40,454 --> 01:10:42,680
Come on. The Demon Pill?

955
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,024
I know about everything.

956
01:10:46,536 --> 01:10:48,079
You said I was the Spirit Pearl.

957
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,149
Put me through training in the painting.

958
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,915
But really you were just
keeping me locked up until I died.

959
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,860
All to make these idiots happy!

960
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,235
To keep your dumb reputation, you locked me away!

961
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:02,360
Now you're being silly.

962
01:11:02,546 --> 01:11:03,969
Don't be so dramatic.

963
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:05,813
I mean, look at all these people!

964
01:11:05,838 --> 01:11:08,524
Eating, drinking, being merry.

965
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:11,407
Why am I not surprised?

966
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:14,422
Fine. If you wanna keep lying too.

967
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:18,700
With the power of sun and moon of sea and sand...

968
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:19,438
Where did you learn that spell?

969
01:11:19,463 --> 01:11:23,376
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

970
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:51,391
Run away!

971
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:55,797
Finally...

972
01:11:55,992 --> 01:11:59,094
It's just you and me demon!

973
01:12:33,172 --> 01:12:37,001
Ne Zha! Stop this!

974
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,333
He's been possessed!

975
01:12:38,477 --> 01:12:40,602
The Qiankun Hoop is our only hope!

976
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:41,985
Find the hoop!

977
01:12:45,118 --> 01:12:46,954
Looking for this?

978
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:49,712
Don't waste your time.

979
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:54,667
Only the heavenly calamity can stop the Demon Pill.

980
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:59,696
Once he's killed Taiyi and his parents, go subdue Ne Zha.

981
01:12:59,762 --> 01:13:01,852
Until the lightning destroys him.

982
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:05,915
And when the dust clears, the
villagers will see you as a hero.

983
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:10,042
After all that, the Supreme Lord will turn you into a god.

984
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:12,360
Your power will be limitless.

985
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,727
Ne Zha's parents and Taiyi.

986
01:13:16,156 --> 01:13:17,781
They are all innocent.

987
01:13:18,508 --> 01:13:20,585
It's not right. If the hoop was still on,

988
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:22,000
then Ne Zha wouldn't be evil.

989
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,208
What do you care if he's good or evil?

990
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:26,696
He's about to get struck by lightning!

991
01:13:27,852 --> 01:13:33,899
If Taiyi and his parents survive how
will I sell our lie to the Supreme Lord?

992
01:13:39,305 --> 01:13:41,962
Fortune didn't smile upon me when I was born.

993
01:13:42,133 --> 01:13:45,243
I had to fight an uphill battle to get this far.

994
01:13:45,313 --> 01:13:49,954
Of all the disciples, I trained
the hardest, never slacking.

995
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,079
Yet continually I was passed over for the others.

996
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,922
Do... Do you know why, my child?

997
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,547
No, master.

998
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:02,282
Because he knows I was born a lowly jaguar spirit.

999
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:05,852
So he could care less if I lived or died!

1000
01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:10,712
To everyone else, you and I are just monsters.

1001
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:14,516
They could construct an entire
mountain with their prejudice.

1002
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:18,493
And no matter how hard you
try, that mountain is immovable.

1003
01:14:18,518 --> 01:14:22,368
But you're being handed a rare
chance to change their minds.

1004
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:24,219
To alter your fate.

1005
01:14:24,883 --> 01:14:27,325
Master. I owe Ne Zha my life.

1006
01:14:27,349 --> 01:14:27,766
Huh?

1007
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:29,538
Maybe I can't save him

1008
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,001
but let me save his parents and his master,

1009
01:14:32,192 --> 01:14:33,484
to repay my debt.

1010
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:34,797
Huh?

1011
01:14:34,993 --> 01:14:35,626
Go.

1012
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:39,172
Go on, then.

1013
01:14:39,977 --> 01:14:43,704
But if, if, if this goes south...

1014
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:46,938
don't say I didn't warn you boy.

1015
01:14:47,079 --> 01:14:51,055
If they discover what you are...

1016
01:14:51,602 --> 01:14:55,883
Then I promise more than four
will meet their fate today...

1017
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:58,876
Uh... Hey. I was talking!

1018
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,532
Nope!

1019
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:14,500
Huh?

1020
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,594
Stop! That's your father.

1021
01:15:57,915 --> 01:16:00,516
Ah, he's so cool.

1022
01:16:27,337 --> 01:16:29,493
Hear that? We're missing the whole party.

1023
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:30,875
Are you sure we can't go out?

1024
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,602
Lord Li said there's a signal.

1025
01:16:32,727 --> 01:16:34,579
Oh. Oh, oh.

1026
01:16:58,625 --> 01:16:59,594
Use the Hoop!

1027
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:03,102
Sun and moon, of sea and sand,
Qiankun Hoop, obey my command!

1028
01:17:15,488 --> 01:17:16,273
Hold!

1029
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:29,126
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1030
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:34,868
Dear? It's your mother.

1031
01:17:44,446 --> 01:17:45,251
Wait!

1032
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,073
Please, wait.

1033
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:01,547
Thank you for your assistance today.

1034
01:18:01,687 --> 01:18:02,977
Tell me, what is your name?

1035
01:18:03,032 --> 01:18:04,958
My name isn't worth knowing, Milord.

1036
01:18:04,983 --> 01:18:07,883
Nonsense, I must make a toast, to thank you.

1037
01:18:07,908 --> 01:18:10,469
I have an urgent task I must attend to.

1038
01:18:11,594 --> 01:18:13,601
I'm sorry. Let me get that.

1039
01:18:13,626 --> 01:18:14,868
No need.

1040
01:18:21,055 --> 01:18:22,243
A dragon!

1041
01:18:22,375 --> 01:18:26,333
Weren't they imprisoned in the Eastern Sea
by the Court of Heaven? How did he get out?

1042
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:29,290
I knew I detected a familiar scent on you.

1043
01:18:29,492 --> 01:18:32,422
But that mark on your head confirms my suspicions.

1044
01:18:32,712 --> 01:18:33,571
That sigil!

1045
01:18:33,762 --> 01:18:36,001
So the dragons stole the Spirit Pearl.

1046
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:39,792
I could chase you if I wanted!

1047
01:18:39,792 --> 01:18:44,555
What else would you expect from a bunch of
dragons? No wonder your kind were locked away.

1048
01:18:45,594 --> 01:18:47,649
Well, you can't cross the dragons.

1049
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:49,821
So, the dragons were the thieves. Figures.

1050
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:52,313
The Court of Heaven shouldn't have left them alive.

1051
01:18:53,985 --> 01:18:55,899
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1052
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:58,438
How unfortunate.

1053
01:18:58,811 --> 01:18:59,594
Brother?

1054
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:03,962
For this to work only four people needed to die.

1055
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,375
But wouldn't you know?

1056
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,375
Now everyone sees what you are.

1057
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,149
Now no one gets to su-sur... survive.

1058
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,007
Please tell me you weren't involved.

1059
01:19:12,094 --> 01:19:15,625
I'm afraid I can't. It would be quite rude to lie.

1060
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:18,407
As for the Pearl, I stole it.

1061
01:19:18,511 --> 01:19:21,751
And Ao Bing is my apprentice.

1062
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,915
Uh, have you lost your mind?

1063
01:19:24,003 --> 01:19:25,735
I'm gonna tell the Supreme Lord!

1064
01:19:27,266 --> 01:19:29,625
Good thing I'm one step ahead then.

1065
01:19:29,672 --> 01:19:33,704
If you all die, there will be no
one left to tell him will there?

1066
01:19:33,946 --> 01:19:35,292
Apprentice,

1067
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,876
there's only one thing to be done.

1068
01:19:39,368 --> 01:19:41,868
The survival of your people

1069
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,875
depends on the next decision.

1070
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:55,641
For the past millennium, the Spirit
Pearl has been our only hope for freedom.

1071
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:58,993
It's all up to you now.

1072
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:21,657
What is he doing?

1073
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:54,602
He's trying to bury Chentang Pass!

1074
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,883
A great deal of time has already passed.

1075
01:21:53,071 --> 01:21:55,351
We should head back as soon as possible.

1076
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:57,415
Maybe there's something we can do for him.

1077
01:22:00,477 --> 01:22:02,633
You can't leave, you just got here!

1078
01:22:03,243 --> 01:22:04,792
I'll die of loneliness!

1079
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:05,917
You're being clingy!

1080
01:22:07,641 --> 01:22:09,268
You can't break this curse

1081
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:10,993
but there are ways around it.

1082
01:22:11,274 --> 01:22:13,891
Like a transplant spell. You thought about that?

1083
01:22:13,985 --> 01:22:17,391
Yeah, but what does he know? Are you
gonna trust me or an annoying cloud?

1084
01:22:17,985 --> 01:22:21,083
I've studied with the Master for centuries before you.

1085
01:22:21,083 --> 01:22:22,460
I know things you don't!

1086
01:22:22,485 --> 01:22:24,708
Let me show you what talent looks like.

1087
01:22:24,708 --> 01:22:26,618
Yeah, okay, airhead.

1088
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:29,149
These guys are Fate-Swapping Runes.

1089
01:22:29,206 --> 01:22:31,622
Find a relative willing to sacrifice their life.

1090
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:35,641
Have them put one rune on themselves,
and the other on the cursed individual.

1091
01:22:35,805 --> 01:22:38,962
And then instead of him, the relative will go boom!

1092
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:51,227
Ow.

1093
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:55,083
Woah, hey! What are you doing?

1094
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:57,767
I've decided to swap my life for that of my son's.

1095
01:22:57,792 --> 01:22:59,292
This stays between you and me.

1096
01:22:59,399 --> 01:23:01,665
I beg of you, don't tell my wife.

1097
01:23:02,813 --> 01:23:03,610
Milord...

1098
01:23:03,891 --> 01:23:06,583
Ultimately, your sacrifice would just go to waste.

1099
01:23:06,704 --> 01:23:11,126
The Demon Pill will bring disaster and
the Supreme Lord will never let him go.

1100
01:23:11,151 --> 01:23:12,376
The Demon Pill?

1101
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:16,188
I will use the remaining two years
I have left to make him a warrior.

1102
01:23:16,296 --> 01:23:18,155
The people shall see him as a hero.

1103
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,165
No, I can't allow it! If you won't allow it,

1104
01:23:20,243 --> 01:23:22,547
when the lightning strikes during the Heavenly Calamity,

1105
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:23,708
I will die with Ne Zha.

1106
01:23:23,751 --> 01:23:25,899
That's, that's so not fair!

1107
01:23:26,222 --> 01:23:27,899
Uh, who is Ne Zha?

1108
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,376
He is my son.

1109
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:09,368
Stop!

1110
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:13,946
Ah!

1111
01:24:15,969 --> 01:24:17,282
That's strong armor!

1112
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:18,180
Aim for the head!

1113
01:24:59,071 --> 01:25:00,305
Ao Bing?

1114
01:25:01,516 --> 01:25:02,962
Don't waste your breath.

1115
01:25:03,352 --> 01:25:05,333
Shen Gonggong? What are you doing here?

1116
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:07,375
It's Shen Gong-Bao!

1117
01:25:08,227 --> 01:25:11,710
Shen Gongbao was the one who stole
the Spirit Pearl and put it in Ao Bing.

1118
01:25:11,735 --> 01:25:14,790
He wants to bury Chentang Pass and everyone in it!

1119
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:21,751
Stop!

1120
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:48,750
Your power is limited by that hoop.

1121
01:25:48,868 --> 01:25:49,962
You've no chance.

1122
01:25:50,008 --> 01:25:52,922
I'll kick your butt! Hoop or no hoop!

1123
01:26:03,907 --> 01:26:05,313
Don't do this.

1124
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,167
Ha! Too slow!

1125
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,883
Fine. Then I'll ice you out!

1126
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:19,508
Stop, my apprentice!

1127
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,531
I'm sorry, master!

1128
01:26:24,635 --> 01:26:25,343
Ne Zha!

1129
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:34,417
That's crazy! What the heck are you wearing?

1130
01:26:34,417 --> 01:26:35,649
Transformation?

1131
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:41,640
Come and get me! You scared?

1132
01:26:42,376 --> 01:26:44,758
Demon, there can only be one of us.

1133
01:26:57,524 --> 01:26:58,321
Ah!

1134
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:00,530
You better watch yourself!

1135
01:27:00,555 --> 01:27:02,093
I was holding back this whole time.

1136
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:04,726
If anyone deserves to be the 12th Golden Immortal,

1137
01:27:04,751 --> 01:27:07,719
it's me, not an incompetent fool like you!

1138
01:27:10,212 --> 01:27:10,883
Huh?

1139
01:27:12,821 --> 01:27:15,750
Hold on. Master entrusted you with the painting,

1140
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:16,438
not me?

1141
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:18,610
Well, maybe he knew you didn't deserve it!

1142
01:27:19,391 --> 01:27:20,587
Very mature of you.

1143
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:22,036
But it's you who'll weep!

1144
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,172
Take that!

1145
01:27:33,444 --> 01:27:34,430
Coward!

1146
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:46,542
Huh?

1147
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,083
Huh? Ha?

1148
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:55,422
I've got you now!

1149
01:27:56,555 --> 01:27:58,625
Stop! I am your master!

1150
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,750
Nice try. Next time, pay more attention to detail.

1151
01:28:05,227 --> 01:28:08,188
Apprentice, let me help you!

1152
01:28:12,305 --> 01:28:13,887
That'll teach you!

1153
01:28:17,118 --> 01:28:18,958
Great! Job well done!

1154
01:28:19,055 --> 01:28:21,235
You are too kind, Master.

1155
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:27,383
Thank you, apprentice!

1156
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:31,778
Huh?

1157
01:28:32,708 --> 01:28:33,360
Uh hey...

1158
01:28:35,422 --> 01:28:37,751
Totally nailed that! Huh?

1159
01:28:49,469 --> 01:28:50,250
No!

1160
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:04,653
Who are you?

1161
01:29:04,677 --> 01:29:06,501
Why... I'm your master!

1162
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,071
Woah it's me, Ne Zha.

1163
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:16,383
Ooh! That's sneaky!

1164
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,735
Come on let's get out of here.

1165
01:29:20,907 --> 01:29:22,626
That brush is our only way out.

1166
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:23,454
Get him!

1167
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:17,016
Ao Bing, grab it.

1168
01:30:26,626 --> 01:30:28,727
Hey, Ne Zha. Grab the brush for me.

1169
01:30:33,227 --> 01:30:36,094
Classy. But you can't keep that up forever.

1170
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:39,610
I, on the other hand, will never run out of ammunition.

1171
01:30:43,883 --> 01:30:46,196
What was that you were saying?

1172
01:30:51,641 --> 01:30:52,829
Good one!

1173
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:10,702
Uh, question, where'd you learn to draw?

1174
01:31:10,727 --> 01:31:12,672
You try drawing with your feet.

1175
01:31:36,714 --> 01:31:37,286
Huh?

1176
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:38,235
Hm?

1177
01:32:06,837 --> 01:32:07,141
Ne Zha!

1178
01:32:07,173 --> 01:32:07,446
Son!

1179
01:32:07,512 --> 01:32:07,968
Ne Zha!

1180
01:32:07,993 --> 01:32:08,439
Son!

1181
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:11,587
Ah!

1182
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:53,485
Power of sun and moon, of sea and sand.

1183
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:58,227
Listen up, Qiankun Hoop, and obey my command!

1184
01:32:58,252 --> 01:33:00,719
Can't lose myself. Gotta focus.

1185
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,735
Stop struggling.

1186
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:00,930
You were born the Demon Pill. Why not accept your destiny?

1187
01:34:02,016 --> 01:34:03,985
'Cause it is not the boss of me.

1188
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,477
I'm the master of my destiny.

1189
01:34:06,502 --> 01:34:08,210
I'll be the one who decides.

1190
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:10,751
And I will not be a demon!

1191
01:35:08,227 --> 01:35:09,126
Huh?

1192
01:35:28,516 --> 01:35:29,837
Why spare me?

1193
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:31,547
I told you.

1194
01:35:32,664 --> 01:35:34,477
You're the only friend I have.

1195
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:46,329
Well, my time's almost up.

1196
01:35:47,338 --> 01:35:48,504
You should leave.

1197
01:35:49,297 --> 01:35:50,667
But aren't you worried I'll...

1198
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,417
I thought you were the Spirit Pearl!

1199
01:35:52,417 --> 01:35:54,672
I'm the Demon Pill and I'm braver than you?

1200
01:35:54,731 --> 01:35:56,016
Don't be such a baby!

1201
01:35:56,524 --> 01:35:57,625
I'm a monster.

1202
01:35:57,958 --> 01:36:00,499
When I was born, my fate was sealed.

1203
01:36:00,524 --> 01:36:01,290
You're not listening.

1204
01:36:01,399 --> 01:36:03,055
Your fate's what you want it to be.

1205
01:36:03,094 --> 01:36:05,241
No one else gets to decide what you are.

1206
01:36:05,266 --> 01:36:06,969
My father taught that to me.

1207
01:36:07,743 --> 01:36:09,469
If fate comes at you swingin'...

1208
01:36:09,494 --> 01:36:11,110
then you hit back.

1209
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:17,204
Ne Zha!

1210
01:36:20,313 --> 01:36:22,110
Ne Zha! Release us!

1211
01:36:30,180 --> 01:36:32,282
I know you want to help but...

1212
01:36:32,307 --> 01:36:33,765
this is my fight.

1213
01:36:34,362 --> 01:36:35,883
Ne Zha! No!

1214
01:36:44,251 --> 01:36:46,758
Huh, you know looking back on it...

1215
01:36:47,465 --> 01:36:48,977
Three years isn't that long.

1216
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:51,469
I had fun while it lasted!

1217
01:36:56,954 --> 01:36:58,261
My only regret?

1218
01:36:59,274 --> 01:37:01,383
I never kicked the Jianzi with you, Dad.

1219
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:12,743
It's my birthday. No crying allowed.

1220
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:20,633
Aw, man.

1221
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,446
Dad. Mom.

1222
01:37:41,032 --> 01:37:41,938
Thank you.

1223
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:03,895
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1224
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:06,165
Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1225
01:38:07,125 --> 01:38:08,649
Ne Zha!

1226
01:38:12,208 --> 01:38:14,844
Ne Zha! Ne Zha! - Ne Zha! Ne Zha!

1227
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,524
Ne Zha!

1228
01:38:40,567 --> 01:38:41,401
Huh?

1229
01:38:41,426 --> 01:38:42,907
Are you nuts?

1230
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,844
Ao Bing, get out of there!

1231
01:38:45,122 --> 01:38:47,837
Dragon scale Armor!

1232
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:14,219
He is ruining my entire plan!

1233
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,399
I'm not done with you.

1234
01:39:16,727 --> 01:39:20,172
You've not seen the last of me!

1235
01:39:20,438 --> 01:39:22,977
You're sacrificing yourself for nothing.

1236
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:24,226
You dumb or what?

1237
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:26,938
'Course I am, I'm your friend after all.

1238
01:40:08,333 --> 01:40:08,985
Huh?

1239
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:19,524
I never expected it could absorb this amount of power.

1240
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:21,665
The Chaos Pearl has an appetite.

1241
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,821
I can't take it.

1242
01:40:29,968 --> 01:40:32,212
I'm about to explode!

1243
01:40:37,188 --> 01:40:38,821
You shouldn't have to...

1244
01:40:38,899 --> 01:40:40,977
Let's give it back.

1245
01:40:41,351 --> 01:40:42,540
Right!

1246
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:56,805
I can't hold on!

1247
01:41:00,258 --> 01:41:03,704
Ne Zha! No!

1248
01:41:04,774 --> 01:41:07,493
How dare they not invite me to join in...

1249
01:41:10,375 --> 01:41:11,938
I love a good party.

1250
01:41:12,682 --> 01:41:14,140
Stay strong, you two.

1251
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,860
Open!

1252
01:41:47,133 --> 01:41:49,376
Where are you? Ne Zha!

1253
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:13,981
How are we alive?

1254
01:42:14,005 --> 01:42:14,946
Ha! We made it!

1255
01:42:15,102 --> 01:42:16,672
Well, not exactly...

1256
01:42:19,969 --> 01:42:22,958
The Multi-colored Lotus couldn't save your bodies...

1257
01:42:23,087 --> 01:42:24,883
but it kept your souls intact.

1258
01:42:25,008 --> 01:42:29,147
Whereas I'm pretty sure I blew my chance
at becoming the 12th Golden Immortal.

1259
01:42:29,172 --> 01:42:30,704
It cost me centuries!

1260
01:42:30,729 --> 01:42:32,876
Now I guess I gotta start over again from scratch!

1261
01:42:32,901 --> 01:42:34,805
Thank goodness.

1262
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:38,071
I thought I'd never see you again!

1263
01:43:02,024 --> 01:43:03,743
if you asked me

1264
01:43:03,883 --> 01:43:06,446
whether a person can alter their fate?

1265
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:08,501
Well, I don't really know.

1266
01:43:09,414 --> 01:43:11,454
But hey, anything's possible.

1267
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,743
Because a boy named Ne Zha,

1268
01:43:13,953 --> 01:43:15,876
forever changed his.

1269
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:29,110
A JIAOZI FILM

1270
01:43:51,876 --> 01:43:52,633
Okay,

1271
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:54,485
but, are you sure we can't go out?

1272
01:43:54,587 --> 01:43:56,821
We, we're still waiting on the signal!

1273
01:43:56,862 --> 01:44:00,274
So uh what exactly is the signal?

1274
01:44:00,723 --> 01:44:01,610
You know...

1275
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:03,766
That's a good question.

1276
01:44:08,587 --> 01:44:12,250
DON'T LEAVE! THERE'S STILL POST-CREDITS SCENE!

1277
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:32,958
Ao Bing...

1278
01:45:33,797 --> 01:45:37,876
Everything we have worked for was laid to waste.

1279
01:45:38,063 --> 01:45:43,571
And for that, I will make all
of Chentang Pass pay in blood.

1280
01:45:47,602 --> 01:45:48,563
Louder,

1281
01:45:48,588 --> 01:45:51,641
I don't think they can hear you!

1282
01:45:51,883 --> 01:45:56,610
Screaming into the void like a child won't change a thing.

1283
01:45:57,407 --> 01:46:02,032
We trusted you to secure our freedom, and you failed us!

1284
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:08,157
Would you like to make a deal?

1285
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,626
Dear brother?

1286
01:46:15,835 --> 01:46:18,126
DON'T YOU DARE LEAVE! THERE
ARE STILL POST-CREDIT SCENE TO SEE

1287
01:49:21,208 --> 01:49:22,946
Jiang Ziya...

1288
01:49:27,516 --> 01:49:28,954
You know your sin.

1289
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:33,208
JIANG ZIYA

1290
