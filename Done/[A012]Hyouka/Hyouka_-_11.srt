83
00:05:46,174 --> 00:05:46,826
Yes.

187
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:02,843
Psh.

14
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,155
Yeah.

38
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,145
Okay.

42
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,563
Yeah.

184
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:53,128
What?

361
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:39,656
Okay.

20
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:42,869
Hotaro!

22
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,405
Hotaro!

71
00:04:56,568 --> 00:04:57,131
Hotaro!

102
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:47,606
Well...

122
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:00,747
Well...

162
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:39,939
Dammit!

293
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:29,480
Nothing.

196
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,614
Yeah, hi.

146
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:19,087
The setup.

166
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:04,070
Let's see.

249
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:20,204
However...

367
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:37,047
Next time:

194
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:37,980
Hey, there.

286
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,254
Fine, then!

331
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:12,563
What is it?

351
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,118
What is it?

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,802
But still...

89
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:58,363
And, well...

202
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,669
Irisu, look.

333
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:19,349
Interesting.

359
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,636
So listen...

7
00:00:25,697 --> 00:00:26,616
It had to be!

47
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:51,052
Meaning what?

50
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:58,099
That's right.

117
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:36,345
You're right.

164
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:56,767
A Tarot book?

167
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,563
"The Empress.

206
00:13:11,754 --> 00:13:12,712
Please enjoy!

292
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:28,043
What's wrong?

350
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:17,281
By the way...

30
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,758
Yeah, she did.

79
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:29,762
Listen, Oreki.

179
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,823
Okay, my turn.

271
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,291
It's pathetic.

284
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:11,985
Am I mistaken?

26
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:57,942
Where's Mayaka?

201
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,849
I'm not coming.

209
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:21,927
Of course I do.

364
00:23:47,754 --> 00:23:48,745
The truth is...

221
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,566
At first glance,

316
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:34,398
And that's that.

67
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,545
Hold on a second!

127
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:13,575
Nice people, huh?

248
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,155
Quite impressive.

277
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:47,809
Isn't that right?

5
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:23,914
Well, yeah, but...

77
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:25,583
Hey, what's wrong?

86
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,878
You can be honest.

158
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,914
Who cares, anyway?

299
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:44,307
But I gotta say...

23
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,527
Whoa, are you okay?

178
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,735
Sounds about right.

212
00:13:27,462 --> 00:13:28,577
You're lying to me!

33
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,184
Right. So what's up?

37
00:03:19,606 --> 00:03:21,021
It was Hongo's idea.

81
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,552
Oh, great. You, too?

143
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:12,259
The theatre setting.

145
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:16,707
The gruesome murder.

175
00:11:26,646 --> 00:11:28,396
Interesting, indeed.

216
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,471
Sherlock Holmes did.

254
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:34,664
Yes, that's correct.

21
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:45,658
Hotaro! Hey, wait up!

230
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,637
Here's my hypothesis.

328
00:22:04,795 --> 00:22:06,001
Why would he do that?

358
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:35,587
Oh, yeah, I get that.

74
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,235
then I'll let this go.

84
00:05:47,341 --> 00:05:48,633
So you didn't like it?

325
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,810
Oh, right, I remember!

366
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,031
That is just like you.

55
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,384
<i>Sherlock Holmes,</i> right?

99
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,795
to be perfectly honest.

144
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:14,689
The cast of characters.

170
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:15,334
So Ibara was "Justice."

215
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,229
What gave my plot away?

281
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,493
That was just a tactic.

16
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:53,133
See you tomorrow, Oreki.

189
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,662
It's pretty fascinating.

193
00:12:20,472 --> 00:12:22,461
Change my point of view?

218
00:13:51,222 --> 00:13:52,595
No, I don't mind at all.

253
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:32,732
But in the film he does.

259
00:15:47,587 --> 00:15:48,876
I have no hard evidence.

318
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,837
It makes more sense now.

44
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,587
There's no inconsistency.

85
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,496
No, it's not that at all.

155
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,321
But where did I go wrong?

52
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:04,487
Yeah, I guess that's true.

224
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:08,212
From what Satoshi told me,

256
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,547
Ibara mentioned that, too.

324
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,527
There was a narrator, too.

173
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:22,658
Satoshi was "The Magician."

205
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:10,869
One green tea for the lady.

237
00:14:44,712 --> 00:14:46,524
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,492
She had to go to Manga Club.

115
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,396
She would have been furious!

141
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:04,782
What does that say about me?

157
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,499
No lucky flashes of insight.

172
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:19,980
Yep, that's not too far off.

176
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,213
And Chitanda was "The Fool."

34
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:14,962
It's about the film's ending.

93
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,937
It's still pretty early, huh?

130
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,419
It was that great of an idea.

195
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,503
It's been a while, hasn't it?

149
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:43,983
Pathetic. Some detective I am.

159
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:29,419
They already wrapped the film.

203
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,520
I'd like to discuss something.

296
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:37,767
Huh? No, it's not that at all.

57
00:04:16,045 --> 00:04:17,716
That's telling, and here's why.

61
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,975
Now, I don't know Hongo at all.

133
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:30,627
That's what I have to find out!

177
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:33,225
"Curiosity, impulse to action."

188
00:12:05,462 --> 00:12:07,626
I dunno, maybe I am "Strength."

210
00:13:22,295 --> 00:13:24,009
Just what did you mean by that?

321
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,061
even in the unfinished version.

29
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:03,409
Did Chitanda have to leave, too?

76
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,029
I gotta go. I'll see you around.

97
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,340
That's why you came to watch it.

156
00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:21,123
I can't wrap my brain around it.

191
00:12:14,712 --> 00:12:16,429
That would be just like Satoshi.

207
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,520
So what did you want to discuss?

214
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,144
Wasn't that your plan all along?

308
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:16,254
Huh? But I thought the window...

312
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:25,348
chased Kaito, and sliced him up.

354
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,633
What would make you think I did?

138
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:50,655
well, that's the only reason why.

204
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:06,522
One Yunnan tea for the gentleman.

320
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,587
Yeah, they turned up in the film,

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,712
I really thought it was fantastic.

72
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:59,524
Is that what you actually believe?

107
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,395
how Hongo wanted the movie to end.

223
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,409
But unfortunately, I was mistaken.

243
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:05,337
But some joker still voted for it.

301
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,105
Not like myself? What's that mean?

368
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,047
"Those Things Piled Up Endlessly."

18
00:02:33,093 --> 00:02:35,919
Did I ignore it? Not intentionally.

182
00:11:43,254 --> 00:11:45,396
Why would Satoshi pick this for me?

285
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,083
Is there something wrong with that?

298
00:20:40,462 --> 00:20:42,485
No, it's not like me. You're right.

305
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:07,910
Ugh, your guess is as good as mine.

24
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,889
Yeah, it's nothing. What's going on?

101
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,612
Then what were you so curious about?

108
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,139
And it would have been a lot easier.

171
00:11:15,462 --> 00:11:17,954
"Equality, righteousness, fairness."

220
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,203
I copied a few of them down for you.

341
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,170
Oh, right, that makes perfect sense!

360
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:38,908
If I tell you, promise not to laugh!

28
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:01,979
Good, I'm actually glad it's just us.

66
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:46,478
I have to tell you that you're wrong.

91
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:04,370
I don't think it was what she wanted.

165
00:10:57,098 --> 00:10:58,995
I didn't know Sis was into this stuff.

235
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,729
First, the small amount of blood used.

255
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:36,920
And that arm was remarkably well-made.

291
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:07,127
I'm not sure why, but that's a relief.

304
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,967
Please tell me. I have to know, Oreki!

54
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,978
in preparation for writing this script?

279
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,663
You said something else to me before...

302
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,152
Well, why don't I just ask, like usual?

330
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:10,155
but I don't think that's the case here.

35
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,212
Was the plot twist part of Hongo's plan?

113
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,025
And if she was too frail to handle that,

240
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,087
So, as far as the answers are concerned,

15
00:00:49,393 --> 00:00:51,633
Well, I'd better get going to Manga Club.

75
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:08,977
That's all I wanted to talk to you about.

229
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:24,803
In the ones marked with an "X," they die.

275
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,879
and she couldn't claim that you hurt her.

278
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:52,395
I don't dispute any of these accusations.

289
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,703
Well, I was not being completely sincere.

343
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,751
So that's how she wanted the story to go?

17
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:32,287
How could I have forgotten about the rope?

41
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:36,553
Are you basing that on something specific?

82
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:44,729
This is about Class 2-F's movie, isn't it?

90
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:00,699
I'm beginning to think you guys are right.

92
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:11,004
And what makes you say that, specifically?

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,695
That's an option I've considered, as well.

180
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,034
"Inner fortitude, fighting spirit, bonds?"

353
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,981
What? No, I didn't know anything about it.

244
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,705
So what about this other single vote, here?

274
00:16:39,936 --> 00:16:42,212
Then, you replaced her script with my work,

297
00:20:38,045 --> 00:20:40,311
So what, then? This isn't like you, y'know.

310
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,810
There are two, but it doesn't matter which.

25
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:56,614
Oh, I wanted to talk to you about something.

140
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:01,954
Chitanda was actually concerned about Hongo.

238
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:52,332
How were you able to get your hands on this?

258
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,549
From here out, my statements are conjecture.

263
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,228
She was much too timid to speak up that way.

346
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,126
Unless Hongo talks, we might never find out.

70
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,543
Hell, maybe she even saw one used in a movie!

147
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:28,165
The killer... lurks among you all undetected!

199
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,854
Listen, there's a launch party this Saturday.

228
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:22,429
are the ones in which the characters survive.

239
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,843
All I had to do was ask if I could borrow it.

233
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,918
She just couldn't stomach it when people died.

174
00:11:22,872 --> 00:11:26,225
"Initiative, originality," and "interest," huh?

192
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:18,923
It's not like he could change my point of view.

311
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:23,592
Konosu snuck in using the rope Hongo asked for,

345
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:00,604
or what made him decide to forgive her, either.

12
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:43,785
and the end caught everyone totally by surprise.

36
00:03:17,295 --> 00:03:19,480
Or did you come up with all of that on your own?

78
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:28,058
I thought you would've already gone home by now.

80
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,574
There's something I wanted to talk to you about.

87
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:54,453
Satoshi and Ibara already talked to me about it.

185
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,450
No way, I am not controlled by women in any way!

198
00:12:43,587 --> 00:12:45,769
We couldn't have done it without you, so thanks.

245
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:11,113
A lone vote for having zero murders in the film.

246
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:13,607
And that was how Hongo cast her vote, wasn't it?

313
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,278
Just one strike, though, not enough to kill him.

339
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,396
The injury could be accounted for pretty easily,

60
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,538
which wasn't until the mid-1920s at the earliest.

163
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:52,317
Maybe I'll read a book to take my mind off of it.

168
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,132
Maternal affection, a fertile mind, sensitivity."

181
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,980
What the heck? That doesn't sound like me at all!

242
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:03,254
'Cause there are only about 30 kids in the class.

251
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,860
I heard that Hongo didn't even come to the shoot.

262
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,837
and demand the class reshoot without the changes.

48
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,540
Have you ever heard of the term "narrative trick"?

88
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,107
They said they knew it wasn't what Hongo intended.

153
00:09:57,545 --> 00:10:00,747
I wasn't asked to come on board as a screenwriter.

283
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,670
All that really matters to you is the bottom line.

309
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,625
I mean the window in the stage right sitting room.

357
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,008
Was your empathy for Hongo really the only reason?

94
00:06:16,212 --> 00:06:18,919
Do you wanna take a walk with me down by the river?

110
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:12,400
If you've got something in mind, you should say it.

123
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,273
Maybe she didn't have confidence in her conclusion.

213
00:13:29,212 --> 00:13:31,420
I wasn't your detective. I was your mystery writer.

217
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,141
Do you care if I spoil some of his stories for you?

269
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:24,634
But in reality it was just a scriptwriting contest.

65
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:44,629
But if you're trying to pass it off as Hongo's work,

73
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:03,860
If it is, and you feel like you made the right call,

128
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:16,051
If the ending you wrote is the one she came up with,

137
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,225
So if it seems to you like I didn't enjoy the movie,

151
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,156
The last scene was really quite a shock to everyone!

236
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:44,419
Second, the unexpected outcome of the questionnaire.

260
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:52,879
Regardless, I have no choice but to say this to you:

265
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:08,260
But you decided to take matters into your own hands.

317
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,462
Ah, that must be why Hongo wished Konosu luck, then.

323
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:51,879
The cast didn't just consist of the people onscreen.

363
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:47,434
Wow, this is a lot more embarrassing than I thought.

232
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,669
She preferred happy endings to tragedies. That's all.

273
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:39,795
That's because you had manipulated our point of view.

300
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,070
You're not acting quite like yourself, either, Oreki.

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,423
Why would she do that if it wasn't a part of her plan?

19
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,607
Did I twist the narrative to make it fit Kaito better?

125
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,307
But the other kids in the class seem like nice people.

197
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,418
The class film turned out quite well, don't you think?

257
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,384
But Kaito died, any way you slice it, no pun intended.

261
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,170
Hongo didn't have the nerve to stand up for her script

10
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:37,825
I'm sorry, I guess I could be mistaken about that part.

109
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,825
And Hongo still would have been able to rest, you mean?

211
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,437
It's ironic that you don't know. I was talking about...

105
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:58,132
Why didn't Irisu talk to someone who was close to Hongo?

276
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,458
She couldn't substantially prove you did anything wrong!

6
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,672
What makes you think the rope was even part of the setup?

63
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:39,009
Personally, the movie turned out to be right up my alley.

150
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:47,254
I'm not saying that you did anything wrong at all, Oreki.

169
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:12,068
From what I've seen, that doesn't seem like Irisu at all.

315
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:32,783
and met up with the rest of the cast, looking nonchalant.

356
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:31,171
which is kind of out of character for you, so I wondered.

154
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:10,160
I did a great job if my assignment was to screw things up.

186
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:00,635
Not my sister, Chitanda, Irisu, or any of the rest of 'em.

200
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,410
Do you think you can come? We'd all love to see you there.

241
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,809
staging a hundred murders in the film would be impossible.

329
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:08,477
Normally, I'd say "to stop the murderer from getting him,"

4
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:18,734
The rope didn't figure into
your new conclusion in any way!

64
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,029
And if it was all your idea,
I promise not to say anything!

135
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,603
all those screams of frustration
were hidden in the script!

250
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:23,596
Her impulsive classmates
decided to improvise the violence.

295
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,708
Is that what's twirling around
inside your head over there?

56
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,928
Exactly, she didn't read
anything other than <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>.

116
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:34,988
And she probably wouldn't have
escorted us to the detectives.

139
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:59,213
While I was busy trying to
figure out the puzzle of the film,

340
00:22:44,504 --> 00:22:46,719
because of the glass that was
all over the floor in the room.

362
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:43,669
I think that Hongo and I are
really similar in a lot of ways.

1
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:09,021
It was clever to have the camera
man be the seventh character.

103
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,941
I was actually more interested
in Hongo as a person, you know?

160
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,844
No matter how hard I think
about it, it won't change anything.

68
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,204
We don't have some comprehensive
list of everything she's read!

161
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:36,768
Dwelling on it now is just a
waste of time and precious energy.

231
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:29,754
Hongo wasn't thinking about the
plotlines when she marked them.

46
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,886
But it wasn't keeping in line
with the story she wanted to tell.

49
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:57,437
Isn't that a way of fooling the
reader with clever storytelling?

58
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:21,219
Doyle didn't use narrative tricks
in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> novels.

266
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:11,438
The way things were going, Hongo
was becoming the class villain.

306
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:11,325
Knowing Kaito's supposed to live
solves the locked-room problem.

307
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,630
Konosu is the real attacker,
and the entry point was the window.

11
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:41,045
Anyway, I thought your idea
turned out to be really entertaining,

290
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,746
And if you choose to call it an
outright lie, that's your choice.

355
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:28,770
You weren't convinced by any of
the other detectives' hypotheses,

314
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:30,315
Then she climbed back up to the
second floor, using the same rope,

334
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:23,420
I bet that after Konosu cuts
Kaito, she stays around for a minute,

337
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:34,237
makes his way to the stage left
wing, and collapses to the ground.

62
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,275
But I find it hard to believe
she'd be on par with Agatha Christie!

335
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:26,714
and Kaito asks her why she stabbed
him, because he's baffled by it.

96
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:33,567
How I was gonna tie up all the
loose ends and wrap the movie, right?

190
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:14,538
Is he using the Tarot to hint at
some kind of judgment he has of me?

322
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:49,292
They did? Only the original six
showed up in the version that I saw.

219
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:56,193
I found some notes tucked into the
novels that Hongo read to prepare.

247
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,786
She didn't want anyone to have to
die in the script she wrote at all.

106
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,596
Eba knows Hongo really well, so
she could have helped Irisu figure out

319
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:42,763
But wait... What about the seventh
character Hongo was trying to cast?

8
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,809
Hongo insisted they find a rope
that could hold a person's full weight!

31
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:07,674
Why? Do you not want them to overhear
what you need to discuss with me?

104
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,113
I thought the whole script thing
was really bizarre from the beginning.

98
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:39,254
No, I didn't really have any interest
in how the movie was going to end,

336
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,654
Then, to cover for her, for whatever
reason, he sends her back upstairs,

39
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:29,452
I would be lying to you if I said I
believed the ending was Hongo's idea.

40
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:33,909
I don't know what she intended to
write, but I am positive that wasn't it.

131
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:24,963
But I don't think she came up with
something that good, so she kept quiet.

326
00:21:56,907 --> 00:22:00,821
So why was the door to the room the
other six found Kaito in locked, then?

344
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:58,453
Yeah, but we still don't know why
Konosu stabbed Kaito in the first place,

348
00:23:07,877 --> 00:23:11,015
and why would the one who was stabbed
let their attacker get away with it?

365
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,526
I don't handle it very well when
characters have to die in movies, either.

294
00:20:30,045 --> 00:20:33,367
You just have to know what kind of
script Hongo actually intended to write.

338
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,842
But then, how would he explain away
the fact that he's been cut that badly?

32
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:11,471
It's nothing major, but I would prefer
to talk about it with you in private.

267
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,427
You set her up to come down with an
illness and leave her script unfinished.

100
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:44,387
That's why I told you that the idea
you came up with was such a brilliant one.

222
00:14:00,754 --> 00:14:04,280
I assumed she had just written them
down as ideas she might use in her script.

342
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:52,545
He could just say that he fell on a
piece of the broken glass and cut himself.

234
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:39,597
Once I thought of it in those terms,
several puzzles suddenly made sense to me.

272
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:35,247
No one caught on to the fact that they
were doing your dirty work, not even me!

287
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:18,826
When you told me I was special, was
that just so you could manipulate me, too?!

327
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:04,706
Kaito went into the stage left wing by
himself, and locked the door behind him.

129
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,670
I'm sure she would have had enough
confidence in it to share it with the others.

119
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,932
Are you implying that Hongo still wanted
to write the rest of the script herself?

126
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,090
I don't think they would be disrespectful
of her idea, or insult her or anything.

252
00:15:26,837 --> 00:15:30,818
The strangest part is that the script
never says that Kaito dies from his injury.

352
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:21,716
Did you happen to know more about this
incident than what you're letting on here?

136
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,475
The version that we ended up with didn't
have any of her real feelings left in it.

142
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:09,661
I saw the script as a literary problem,
and forgot about the human side of things.

227
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,379
I talked it over with Satoshi, and I
realized that the stories with double circles

303
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:01,942
I'm curious. What kind of script did
Hongo originally dream up for the class film?

349
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,654
I'm dying to know why Hongo was trying
to depict that scenario in the first place.

69
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:53,945
Maybe she learned to use narrative tricks
by reading about them in some other book!

282
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,258
You don't truly care about the feelings
of people who don't have natural abilities.

43
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,962
How could I have missed an inconsistency
so glaring that two people picked up on it?

268
00:16:16,504 --> 00:16:20,376
Then you rallied her classmates together
and held a meeting of collective deduction.

132
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,004
And if all that's true, what was it that
pushed her to the point of not finishing it?

270
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:29,122
Once you realized they couldn't write to
your standards, you dragged us into it, too.

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,058
I just thought it didn't fit with the rest
of the film, if you want my honest opinion.

53
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,738
Do you remember our conversation about the
books Hongo used to study the mystery genre

225
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,869
"The Red-Haired League" and "The Three
Garridebs" have pretty much the same plot line.

264
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:04,811
I think she had some guilt about ignoring
the death toll tally from the questionnaire.

114
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,570
I would think Eba would have gotten so mad
at the class she wouldn't have participated.

118
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:44,737
Did Hongo really not tell anyone else in
the class how the rest of her film played out?

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,658
Even if she had gotten sick in the middle
of things, they could have asked her about it.

51
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,707
The surprise twist of the murderer being the
camera man in this film is a perfect example.

120
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,897
No. From the way Eba described her, I get
the impression Hongo's too meek to insist on it.

121
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:59,230
I don't think that kind of girl would have
the gall to keep her classmates waiting around.

347
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:07,837
I guess we'll leave it at that, but why would
anyone want to stab one of their classmates,

59
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:26,295
Except for a handful of cases, narrative
tricks weren't in use until Agatha Christie's era,

111
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:18,812
I think Hongo had a clear vision of her script
from the beginning, right up to the very end.

183
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:51,593
"Strength is represented by a picture of a
ferocious lion being controlled by a kind woman."

332
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:17,941
Oh, I just had the realization that I understand
Hongo's intentions a little bit better now.

208
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,812
Do you remember the last time we were here,
when you said that I was gifted, a "true genius?"

95
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:30,310
So, Oreki, do you know what it was that made me
so curious about all of this in the first place?

280
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,634
That when people have talent and can't recognize
it, they unknowingly hurt those who don't have any.

152
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:55,764
It may not have been what Hongo originally intended,
but at the end of the day it was a great ending.

134
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:35,752
I believe that all of her regrets, how she really
felt about not being able to finish what she started,

148
00:09:30,548 --> 00:09:35,554
I never even considered that Hongo could have
written her feelings into the script as some hidden code.

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:13,824
And I thought the scene where the other six looked
into the camera at the same time had a lot of impact.

288
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:27,866
When you said it's right to acknowledge who you really
are, you were thinking of your own selfish interests!

226
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:16,732
So why did she mark, "The Red-Haired League" with a
triangle, but "The Three Garridebs" with a double-circle?
