1
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,493
Is that you, Sis?

2
00:00:41,754 --> 00:00:43,985
Guess who's finally ho-oome?

3
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:50,140
I expect a big "welcome back" hug when I come out.

4
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:52,620
I think I'll pass.

5
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,020
After I've been away for so long?

6
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:56,664
What a heartless little brother!

7
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,298
Hm.

8
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:38,621
Is this a souvenir from South America?

9
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:42,332
Sure is. You wanted one, right?

10
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:43,570
No, not really.

11
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:02,432
This is unusual. Since when do you watch TV?

12
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,682
What about the paper?

13
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,848
I don't feel like working my brain.

14
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:06,796
Hmm.

15
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,010
Your calendar looks pretty empty.

16
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,015
My schedule is packed full.

17
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,182
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

18
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,093
Napping.

19
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,750
I know about a job where you can get paid
for just sitting there all day long. Want it?

20
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:27,236
Mmm.

21
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,096
Well? You interested?

22
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:30,526
Mmm.

23
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,723
That sounds like a "yes" to me.

24
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,610
I'll let them know to expect you.

25
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:41,777
Here.

26
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,643
You're going to need this.

27
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:51,245
Yes, Oreki residence?

28
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:55,043
Oh, hi Satoshi! It's been a long time, huh?

29
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,712
Yeah. I just got back.

30
00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:00,503
Hotaro? Sure, he's here. Hold on a sec, 'kay?

31
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,068
Hotaro! Satoshi's on the phone for you.

32
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:05,760
Mmm.

33
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:09,137
Hey. You know that book I lent you last week?

34
00:04:09,184 --> 00:04:10,053
You done reading it yet?

35
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:11,189
Mmm.

36
00:04:11,723 --> 00:04:12,807
Is that a "yes"?

37
00:04:12,978 --> 00:04:14,615
'Cause if you are, I'd like to get it back.

38
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,774
Mmm.

39
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:18,086
So, can I come pick it up today?

40
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:22,742
Mmm. Just stop by after I get off work.

41
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:23,162
Huh?

42
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,061
After I get off work.

43
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,602
A job? You have a job?

44
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:30,001
I don't understand. What's going on?

45
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:34,015
It's no big deal. I'm just filling in
as a lifeguard over at the municipal pool

46
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:35,564
for somebody my sister knows.

47
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,622
Ahh. Your sister. That explains it.

48
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:41,473
Still, the thought of you doing
actual work boggles the mind.

49
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,413
Well, anyway, I've got to get going.

50
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,520
All right. Maybe I'll stop by the pool for a swim later.

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,615
Suit yourself. See ya.

52
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,498
Bye.

53
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:19,188
Hotaro!

54
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,825
Hey! How's it going?

55
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,349
I didn't realize all three of you were going to show up.

56
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,015
I called the ladies right after we got off the phone.

57
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:36,022
I said if they came with me,
they'd see a truly exceptional sight.

58
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,081
Yeah, you did. So where is it, then?

59
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,321
Right there! The elusive Working Hotaro.

60
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:44,015
I gotta tell you, I'm a little underwhelmed.

61
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:46,891
Not me! We all get to hang out at the pool together.

62
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,560
I think this is going to be fun!

63
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,683
Yeah. You're right. Let's make the best of it.

64
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,265
Hey, you creep!

65
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,976
Unless you're looking for trouble,
you better keep your eyes off my girl!

66
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,271
Calm down. He wasn't doing anything.

67
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,848
Yeah, I was just standing here.

68
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,031
Sir, please take it easy, or I'm
going to have to ask you to leave.

69
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,589
What's all that about?

70
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,647
Whatever's going on, I just hope I can stay out of it.

71
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,435
Come on, sweetie, you can do it!

72
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,650
Catch!

73
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,793
Are you ready, Mayaka? It's coming your way!

74
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,041
And... go!

75
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:25,988
Here!

76
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:29,898
It's all yours.

77
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:32,998
You can do it! Spike that ball!

78
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:34,964
Huh? Spike? I... Oh!

79
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,098
That was a pretty sad showing.

80
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:41,681
Right! Penalty game! You know what to do.

81
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:01,667
Ah! I'm sorry! They made me!

82
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,472
You watching?

83
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:11,576
Whoo!

84
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:12,640
Ready, set...

85
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,507
Here we go!

86
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,265
All right, get ready!

87
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,960
Here... I... come!

88
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:25,726
Wooohoohoo!

89
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,666
You think you're funny, don't you?

90
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,274
Hey!

91
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:36,569
Time to switch up. You can take your lunch break now.

92
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,533
Hey, Oreki.

93
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:49,339
We were going to eat too, if you'd like to join us.

94
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:54,307
If I'd had a little more warning, I could've
made something a lot better than this for lunch,

95
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:56,228
but I guess it'll have to do.

96
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,834
Hey, don't look at me. This one's all on Hotaro.

97
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,288
Yeah, why do you say that?

98
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,189
He's a monument to idleness! Look in the
dictionary and you'll see his picture next to the word.

99
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,390
Then out of nowhere, he suddenly
decides to start earning a living.

100
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,312
He should've told us about it immediately.

101
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,924
Really. Why didn't you?

102
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:15,653
Heh...

103
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,705
Well, anyway. I'm glad we all got together like this.

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,023
It's been a lot of fun!

105
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,241
Mm. Totally.

106
00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:25,307
I have to say, though, it's not exactly a perfect match.

107
00:08:25,442 --> 00:08:26,975
What's not a perfect match?

108
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:29,948
The pool and Hotaro.

109
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,061
That's for sure.

110
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,098
Come on, you two, that's not very nice.

111
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,446
Swimsuits and Oreki don't go together either!

112
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:39,401
Yep! The sun and Hotaro, there's another bad match for ya.

113
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:41,467
The sea and Oreki!

114
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,198
How about summer and Hotaro?

115
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,456
Okay, enough already. Tell them to stop, Oreki.

116
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:47,868
Hm.

117
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:53,096
All right. Anybody else wanna get back in the pool?

118
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,839
Sounds good to me. I'll take
care of throwing out our trash.

119
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:59,430
I have a few more bites, but when
I'm done, I'll put our chairs back.

120
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,327
There we go.

121
00:09:09,288 --> 00:09:12,267
Aww. One ice cream wasn't enough, huh?

122
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:15,318
Well, you certainly do have a sweet tooth, don't you?

123
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,703
All right, you win. Let's go and get you another.

124
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,063
That startled me for a second.

125
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,199
Yeah.

126
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,118
So, are you liking the job so far?

127
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,947
Sure. It's okay.

128
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,784
I've always wondered what being a lifeguard was like.

129
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,644
Look how fast they are!

130
00:09:51,015 --> 00:09:54,732
I wonder if they're training to be
competitive swimmers when they get older.

131
00:09:56,365 --> 00:10:00,349
You never know, one of them might even
win a gold medal at the Olympics someday.

132
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:03,368
Yeah, maybe.

133
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:04,315
Huh?

134
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,640
It all just comes down to what kind of person they are.

135
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,015
You know what I mean?

136
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:10,198
If they're special, they'll do something great.

137
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,687
If they're average, they'll just lead an average life.

138
00:10:15,557 --> 00:10:18,822
And what about you? Have you ever wanted to be special?

139
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:24,137
Not really. I'm just a regular
guy, and that's all right with me.

140
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:31,559
That's not true. You are special! To me, anyway!

141
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,599
Huh?

142
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:35,237
And the same thing goes for Fukube and Mayaka.

143
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:39,758
You might not think of yourselves as being
special, but I do because you're my friends!

144
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,991
I'm not talking about subjective opinions.

145
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:44,448
Objectively speaking, I'm not...

146
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:46,368
My opinion should count too!

147
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:52,145
I don't think it's a simple matter of looking around
and categorizing everyone as either special or average.

148
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,664
There's more to life than that.

149
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,823
As long as there's someone, even just one person,

150
00:10:55,848 --> 00:10:58,461
who thinks you're special, I think that means you are!

151
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:04,887
Oh. I'm sorry. I just, uh... I should get going.

152
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,589
Ha ha ha! Wait up!

153
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,932
That's not true. You are special!

154
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,288
My opinion should count too!

155
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:41,529
Okay, Oreki. It's your break time.
I'll take over here for a little bit.

156
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,682
So... Are you on break?

157
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:58,690
Mm.

158
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,465
Well, um... There's something
that I'm sort of curious about.

159
00:12:03,854 --> 00:12:04,465
Huh?

160
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,548
Yeah, it has to do with the
serious business of lifeguarding.

161
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:11,306
You see the woman over there...
the one in the red swimsuit?

162
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,403
Mm.

163
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:17,115
She's the same one we saw earlier
when we were finishing lunch.

164
00:12:17,226 --> 00:12:19,800
I remember that she had something white on her ear.

165
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:23,525
But then I looked at her again
just now, and it's not there.

166
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,432
I'm surprised you noticed something that tiny.

167
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:28,848
I notice little things about people sometimes.

168
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,231
I don't know why.

169
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,750
So? Why ask me about it?

170
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:38,765
Well, as one of the pool's lifeguards, we thought
you'd be concerned about the potential safety hazard.

171
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,783
If there's an earring lying around out
there, someone could step on it and get hurt.

172
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:52,598
So, anyway. I thought maybe you could look for it with us.

173
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:56,021
Find one earring in a place like this?

174
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:56,998
Is she kidding?

175
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,399
And you're sure you saw something on her ear earlier?

176
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,345
Yes.

177
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:06,563
Even so, before we start an all-out
search, maybe we should verify that with her.

178
00:13:06,932 --> 00:13:08,875
[I thought of doing that, but, well...

179
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,626
I'm worried that I'll get yelled at.

180
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,280
All you're doing is asking about an earring.

181
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:17,698
I'm sure you'll be fine.

182
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:19,808
Then how about you go and ask her?

183
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:21,881
Thanks, I'm good.

184
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:22,620
Hmph.

185
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,774
Please, I'd appreciate it so much!

186
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:27,407
Come on. Isn't this a lifeguard's job?

187
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,888
Well? What do you say?

188
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,975
Please help! I have to know!

189
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,184
Huh?

190
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,194
That jerk from before?

191
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:51,223
I don't wanna get him riled up again, y'know?

192
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:52,110
Yeah.

193
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:56,911
Tell ya what, I don't want to turn this into
a big deal. So let's look for it discreetly.

194
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,703
Sure. It'll be slow-going alone, though.

195
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,691
Right.

196
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:02,918
Well, you're not the only lifeguard we have.

197
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,013
I'll get the others to check the poolside.

198
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:08,128
As for you... you can start inside the pool.

199
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,136
'Kay.

200
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,853
Don't worry. I'll help look.

201
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,370
Yeah, same goes for me.

202
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,323
Well... Guess I'm in too, then.

203
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:15,557
Okay, thanks.

204
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,329
All right everybody, what's the
best way to start looking for it?

205
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:21,285
Our best bet's probably to split the place into sections.

206
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,938
Good idea. What do you think of that, Oreki?

207
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:25,618
Knock yourselves out.

208
00:14:25,643 --> 00:14:28,563
Seriously, would it kill you to show a little initiative?

209
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:31,613
You're the lifeguard here, so that
means you should be the one in charge.

210
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:34,164
Just assign us to different parts of the pool.

211
00:14:37,247 --> 00:14:40,545
Okay, fine, I'll take care of it then. So...

212
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:43,625
Chitanda and Mayaka, you two have the stair area.

213
00:14:43,892 --> 00:14:48,183
Hotaro gets the slide area. And
I'll take the diving board area.

214
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:49,656
Well? Sound okay?

215
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:50,698
Yes, leave it to us!

216
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,890
Sure, why not?

217
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,913
Whatever.

218
00:14:57,102 --> 00:14:58,134
Just curious...

219
00:14:58,205 --> 00:14:58,578
Hm?

220
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:00,515
Why did you take this job?

221
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,431
Did you owe your big sister or something?

222
00:15:05,223 --> 00:15:06,468
No, I just took it.

223
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:08,448
That's not really staying true to your motto.

224
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:11,456
What happened to "If I don't have to, I'm not going to"?

225
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:13,448
What's it matter to you?

226
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:14,835
All right! Better!

227
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,664
I'm glad to get a reaction out of you finally,

228
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:20,119
even if it is a pissy one. Much less boring.

229
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:20,881
Ah...

230
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,240
See ya. Happy hunting.

231
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:20,998
Oreki!

232
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,138
Doesn't look like you're working very hard.

233
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,923
I'm pulling my weight. I just found something at
the bottom of the pool and came to throw it away.

234
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:32,145
Sure you did.

235
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,515
You know what? Just looking at you right now is enough

236
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,954
to drain all my energy. I'm
practically falling asleep here.

237
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:47,201
So stop looking at me.

238
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,557
I'm used to being annoyed or
exasperated when I look at you.

239
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,214
This is different, though.

240
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,649
Either way, you're a real pain most of the time.

241
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,198
But do us all a favor.

242
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,850
Go back to being the kind of pain you used to be.

243
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,307
You're a lot more fun to be around when you actually talk.

244
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,537
More fun to be around... Huh?

245
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:34,258
Any luck?

246
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:36,289
No, none. But...

247
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:37,848
I don't think we need to keep looking anymore.

248
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,392
Ah! I know what that means, Hotaro.

249
00:17:40,582 --> 00:17:42,013
You've figured it out, haven't you?

250
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah. I think I've got it.

251
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:52,651
Chitanda.

252
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:55,583
Are you sure it was an earring you saw the woman wearing?

253
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:59,105
Am I a hundred percent sure? I guess not.

254
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:02,909
All I can say for certain is there
was something white on her left ear.

255
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,140
What else could it be, though? There's no
other jewelry you wear on your ears, is there?

256
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,192
Right. That's what I'm wondering:

257
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,821
what else could it be?

258
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:14,098
What if we assume it wasn't
actually jewelry to begin with?

259
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,160
What? Now you've lost me.

260
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,003
Look at what she's doing right now.

261
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,562
If she were wearing anything in her
ears, would she be smacking them like that?

262
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,287
Sounds like it would be kind of painful to me.

263
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,470
What's your point?

264
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,707
I would guess that whatever she had on
her ear was probably something that got there

265
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:31,429
without her even knowing it.

266
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,900
All right, then. What do you think it could've been?

267
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,561
That's the question.

268
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:39,287
Satoshi. Would you do me a favor and pick Ibara up?

269
00:18:39,432 --> 00:18:40,336
Sure.

270
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:42,655
Mm...

271
00:18:45,973 --> 00:18:49,057
No! I don't want him to.

272
00:18:49,187 --> 00:18:50,998
All right, what if Chitanda does it?

273
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,462
That's not gonna make it any less embarrassing.

274
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:56,139
I don't wanna be picked up like I'm some little kid, okay?

275
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:58,062
Well, that's a shame.

276
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,960
Since seeing a little kid picked
up is exactly what I'm after.

277
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,076
Why do you want somebody to pick me up in the first place?

278
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,649
'Cause I'm trying to prove a theory.

279
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:07,753
About whatever was on the woman's ear?

280
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:08,501
Yeah.

281
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:09,787
Hm...

282
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,015
I'm game if you are. What can it hurt?

283
00:19:18,098 --> 00:19:18,949
Eh...

284
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,799
Ah, all right, you win. I'll sacrifice my dignity.

285
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:35,419
Impressive, Chitanda. I didn't know you were so strong.

286
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:36,682
What's that supposed to mean?

287
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:39,417
Whoa, hold on! I didn't mean it that way, I swear.

288
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:42,240
It was just, y'know, a general observation, that's all.

289
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,140
Yep. It fits.

290
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,423
What fits? Were you able to prove your theory?

291
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,592
It's her hand. She's resting it on your shoulder.

292
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,892
So... Can she stop holding me now?

293
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:53,604
Yeah. I've seen enough.

294
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,709
Down you go.

295
00:19:57,765 --> 00:19:59,260
Look over there for a second.

296
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:03,920
Earlier, I saw the woman in the red suit holding that kid.

297
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:07,127
Exactly the way Chitanda was holding Ibara.

298
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,869
If he was eating an ice cream
cone like that at the same time,

299
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:12,570
what would've happened?

300
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:13,474
I get it!

301
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:16,810
The cone would've been at the perfect
height to get ice cream on the woman's ear!

302
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:18,496
And there you have it.

303
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:22,904
Ah... So that explains why it isn't there anymore.

304
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,837
Either it washed off while she was
swimming or she just wiped it off herself.

305
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,120
Case closed. Mystery solved.

306
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,529
You know, Oreki...

307
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,031
Yeah, what's up?

308
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,453
Well, um... It's just...

309
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:43,824
That was great! I think the way you're able to
figure things out makes you a really special person!

310
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,515
Heh. Flattery will get you nowhere with me.

311
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:53,322
Hm.

312
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:53,873
Hm.

313
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:58,155
Sure.

314
00:20:58,848 --> 00:21:02,416
And here I was starting to think we'd
never hear another snappy retort from you!

315
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:03,887
Would that be so bad?

316
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,596
You wouldn't think. But you were totally
weirding us out for a little while there.

317
00:21:07,987 --> 00:21:08,667
Hmph.

318
00:21:10,647 --> 00:21:14,388
Ah! Sorry! I just realized I haven't thanked you yet.

319
00:21:15,882 --> 00:21:19,077
Thanks a lot. Sorry to bother
you with something like this.

320
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:22,307
I made a big fuss. And it was all for nothing.

321
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:23,640
Hey. I...

322
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:28,268
No, you shouldn't apologize. I mean, I'm the one
who thought it was an earring in the first place.

323
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:30,159
I'm sorry. Really.

324
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,050
Seriously, it's no big deal.

325
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:35,473
Alllriiight! I don't know about the rest of you,

326
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:37,432
but all this searching has made me hungry.

327
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,572
I could really go for some ice crea...

328
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:44,494
What's up? Why'd you cut off like that? Ah! <i>Hyouka</i>!

329
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:47,195
I seem to remember you solemnly swearing to me that you

330
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:49,932
would have your <i>Hyouka</i> draft
done by tomorrow, rain or shine!

331
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,144
Well, Fuku. Have you finished it yet?

332
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:56,323
Well, I guess you could say I have it more
or less finished. Give or take a page or two.

333
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,184
So the answer is no. It isn't finished. Is that correct?

334
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,365
Yeah. I guess you could say that, too.

335
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,348
That is exactly what I would say!

336
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:07,198
We're leaving! I'm taking you home right
now, and you're going to write that draft!

337
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:11,211
I don't care how long it takes, I'm not
letting you out of my sight until it's done!

338
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,880
Look. There's not much left to do.

339
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:15,684
I can take care of it myself, I promise, okay?

340
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,291
I don't believe you!

341
00:22:17,765 --> 00:22:21,866
Sorry to leave like this, you guys, but
a deadline's a deadline. See you tomorrow.

342
00:22:22,078 --> 00:22:24,161
Well, wish me luck... ah! Ah!

343
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,704
I hope it doesn't take too long to get the draft done.

344
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:29,285
Oh, I'm sure it will.

345
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:32,256
For those two, I think the thrill is all in the chase.

346
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,980
I wish they'd get to it already.

347
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,355
The thrill is in the chase, huh?

348
00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:41,956
Well, I guess I dragged you along on a chase of
my very own, didn't I? Sorry I'm always doing that.

349
00:22:42,348 --> 00:22:44,782
Yeah, seriously. You can be a real nuisance.

350
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:46,581
Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.

351
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:52,048
On the other hand, maybe that's not such a bad thing.

352
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,143
Huh?

353
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,034
Nothing. Just forget about it.

354
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:56,472
Oh.

355
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,738
That's right, I was wondering...

356
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:01,780
With that woman...

357
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:04,377
What gave you the idea that it was ice cream on her ear?

358
00:23:04,728 --> 00:23:06,959
Oh, that's simple. Just look around.

359
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,636
Ice cream's the only thing in this place that's white.

360
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:15,254
I guess there is one other thing.

361
00:23:15,508 --> 00:23:15,951
Huh?

362
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,973
Well. I should probably get going now, too.

363
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:29,499
Have fun. I guess I'll see you later.

364
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:30,984
Uh. Yeah.

365
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:41,356
Hey!

366
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:44,508
Break time's over.

367
00:23:45,238 --> 00:23:46,239
All right.

368
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:55,725
Man, what a pain.
