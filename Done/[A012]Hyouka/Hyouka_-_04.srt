1
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:12,858
Unless we find the first issue,
we're kind of spinning our wheels.

2
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:14,328
Yeah, you're right.

3
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:18,555
It might be a good idea to bring
Satoshi and Ibara in on this.

4
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:21,359
No. I'd really rather not.

5
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:24,751
Well, it could take a long time for us to solve this.

6
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:27,818
And we might not find anything
out before your uncle's funeral.

7
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:30,288
His funeral...

8
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,000
Fine, let's ask them.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,623
I have a feeling that we're gonna need
all the help we can get to figure it out.

10
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:49,250
I just... I have to know!

11
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:52,593
What happened to my uncle so long
ago has weighed on me for years.

12
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm begging you all to help me find out.

13
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,702
Your uncle sounds like an interesting guy.

14
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:59,333
Did all of that really happen?

15
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,198
The story of a forgotten hero,

16
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:03,660
uncovered by his niece 45 years later.

17
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,378
You know, we were just looking
at some stuff from that period.

18
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,541
That's true.

19
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:09,445
I'm also fascinated by this picture.

20
00:01:09,516 --> 00:01:11,169
I'd love to help find out the truth.

21
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:12,917
This is kind of exciting, huh?

22
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:16,420
If we figure it out,
we should write about it in the anthology.

23
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,558
We can investigate all we want, and call it club business.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,303
And so, this is the story of how all the members
of the Classic Lit Club became fully invested

25
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,625
in illuminating the mysteries of its past.

26
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,705
Hey there! Did you wait long?

27
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,126
Hey! What is your problem, man?

28
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,162
Put a sock in it!

29
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:13,315
What the matter with you, screaming like that?

30
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:16,041
Anyway, did you bring all your research to present?

31
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,166
Of course, and what about you? Did you find anything good?

32
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,750
Yeah, I found a few things.

33
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:23,793
Awesome. I'm looking forward to
hearing your hypothesis, too.

34
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,023
Aw, crap.

35
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,152
I forgot we were supposed to come up with one.

36
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,292
All right, let's get going.

37
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:34,598
The Chitandas are a super-rich farming family,
so their mansion should be top notch!

38
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,850
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself so much.

39
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,089
What can I say, I love cycling!

40
00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,058
Speeding through town like the wind by the
power of your legs alone is thrilling, you know?

41
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:04,287
Not that. I'm talking about your whole
attitude about high school life so far.

42
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:06,768
Oh, right, the "sunshine and roses" bit.

43
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:10,557
That's just me.

44
00:04:10,613 --> 00:04:13,227
I like to stay sunny regardless of my circumstances.

45
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,875
I'd say "sunny" is putting it kinda mildly.

46
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:17,676
Whatever!

47
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,425
Why should anybody live their
life under a little black cloud?

48
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,141
You said that last time we discussed this.

49
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,189
Did I really?

50
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:26,708
Well, I don't mean it as an insult or anything bad;
it's just foreign to me.

51
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,470
Hmph.

52
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:30,958
I guess my attitude is all sunshine
and roses at the end of the day.

53
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,791
You can throw shade all you want,
but it's not gonna change that!

54
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,570
I won't be rained out!

55
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:37,793
Well, maybe you should rein it in a little.

56
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:38,958
Not a chance, buddy!

57
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,333
What's the big problem?

58
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,375
You think I'm overextending myself with all
these extracurricular activities, is that it?

59
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:45,666
Well, am I wrong?

60
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,874
Yeah, you are.

61
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,558
Even if I weren't in clubs, I'd find things to do.

62
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,752
I'm just an energetic guy, you know?

63
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:56,250
And if I wanted to insult you,
I'd call you boring, not pessimistic.

64
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,683
Yeah, well, I really don't care
what you think about me anyway.

65
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,693
That's pretty obvious!

66
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:07,084
Oh, hey, how did you end up doing on your midterms?

67
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,072
Average overall, of course.

68
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,898
There's that little black cloud again.

69
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:12,924
There it is, up ahead!

70
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,166
That's the Chitanda family estate.

71
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:22,666
What'd I tell ya?

72
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,484
Pretty sick digs, right?

73
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,041
Come on, they're probably getting antsy in there.

74
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,029
Fine. Hey, wait!

75
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:33,533
Wouldn't it be super cool if
a butler came to escort us in?

76
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm glad you made it!

77
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,541
We thought you guys got lost!

78
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:43,505
Sorry.

79
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,253
Don't mind if I do.

80
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:48,382
Come on in, we're back here.

81
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,568
Sit where you want. Make yourselves at home, okay?

82
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,103
You sure took your time.

83
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,958
We aren't even late, calm down.

84
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:11,828
Hmph.

85
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,660
I've never seen a man less suited to
take the seat at the head of the table.

86
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:18,977
All right!

87
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:21,725
I guess we should get this party started, don't you think?

88
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:22,554
Second!

89
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:23,229
Sure!

90
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:23,882
Yeah.

91
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,521
The purpose of today's meeting is to investigate what
took place within the Classic Lit club 45 years ago.

92
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,641
If we do happen to find out anything,

93
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,774
then I want to include it in the
anthology for the festival this year.

94
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:37,570
First, let's each share reports
on any data we've gathered,

95
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,771
followed by some Q and A about those findings,

96
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:41,448
then propose our hypotheses.

97
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,728
Finally, we'll discuss the various theories
and decide how we should proceed from there.

98
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,914
Dang, she's kind of a natural leader.

99
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,956
Okay, who do we think should go first?

100
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,117
I mean... uh...

101
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:54,269
Oh, geez, I can't decide who should start.

102
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:55,808
I take it back.

103
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,067
Does it really matter?

104
00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:59,100
Chitanda, why don't you lead us off, okay?

105
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,294
Right, good idea.

106
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:03,185
I'll begin, and then we'll go
in clockwise order from there.

107
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:06,870
I decided to research the old anthology, titled <i>Hyouka</i> .

108
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:11,144
The only reference I could find to the events
of our investigation was in this forward.

109
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,845
I compiled all the facts from it and
included them on the second page.

110
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,452
Let's look at item one.

111
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,114
"Senpai" refers to my uncle, Jun Sekitani,

112
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:21,458
the subject of our quest.

113
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,083
We know that Jun was kicked out of Kamiyama High,

114
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,590
and thus his academic career
ended as a middle school graduate.

115
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:32,333
Item two just shows that the story
became more exaggerated as time passed.

116
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,343
He started as a hero and turned into a legend.

117
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:38,864
Items three and five are connected.

118
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,842
He was a quiet and kind "senpai,"

119
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,733
and once he turned "warrior," he morphed into a "hero."

120
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,918
In the end...

121
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,587
...he became a martyr.

122
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:52,060
Item four is curious to me,
but we'll talk about that later.

123
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:54,087
That concludes my presentation.

124
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,350
What do you think? Any questions for me?

125
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,535
I have one.

126
00:07:57,637 --> 00:08:01,714
Why did you leave out the part where the author says,
"It was in no way a heroic tale?"

127
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,034
Because that's an opinion, and I only included facts.

128
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:06,831
Maybe by that, they just mean
the fights were really scrappy.

129
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:09,183
That they weren't anything awe-inspiring or remarkable.

130
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,541
That could be true.

131
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,333
Okay, now let me tell you my hypothesis.

132
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:18,250
I think my uncle may have protested some school policy,
and was asked to leave as a result.

133
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,543
There's something else.

134
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,014
It's not stated objectively in the forward,
but I inferred it from the wording.

135
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:26,041
This says it had been "a year since" the events occurred.

136
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:29,712
That means my uncle was expelled around
the time of the previous Kanyasai.

137
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:31,266
This is kind of off topic,

138
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:35,958
but my friend who goes to another school told me
they had an incident at their cultural festival last year.

139
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,333
A culture fest shakedown!

140
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:40,334
Extortion and larceny, a dark, seedy underbelly!

141
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,375
I guess every generation has its crooks
who wanna spoil it for the rest of us.

142
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:47,633
Maybe people like that tried to
target Kami High's festival that year,

143
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,683
and when my uncle led the charge
to defend the school against them,

144
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,250
he got punished for fighting.

145
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,992
That would be in line with the whole hero narrative.

146
00:08:55,366 --> 00:09:00,237
I think the underclassmen who looked up to my uncle
for his bravery were mad that he got expelled,

147
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,041
and they wrote this in honor of him.

148
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,003
Hmm... I don't buy it.

149
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,488
Yeah, I agree with Hotaro.

150
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,649
Seriously?

151
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:08,708
What part of it doesn't add up to you?

152
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:09,791
Well, for starters,

153
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,733
do you remember what I suggested we do

154
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,760
instead of the anthology when you first brought it up
to me that day?

155
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:15,873
Lemme see...

156
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:17,771
A concessions stand!

157
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:18,534
That's right.

158
00:09:18,615 --> 00:09:22,198
You told me that selling refreshments had
never been allowed at the Kanyasai before.

159
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,548
So why would anyone try to rip off a festival

160
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,979
where they knew no money would be changing hands?

161
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:30,420
They might have come with other bad
intentions besides stealing people's money.

162
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:33,208
Didn't think of that one, did ya, Hotaro?

163
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:33,987
Fine.

164
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:36,537
Why don't you wow us with your take on her theory?

165
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,350
A bunch of punks disrupting the Kanyasai,

166
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:40,675
I'm sorry to say,

167
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,458
would never have happened back then.

168
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,500
Why not?

169
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,094
When you think of that time-period,

170
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:47,485
the 1960s, what images come to mind?

171
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,660
Hmm...

172
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:53,148
Tokyo, the Diet building, protests,
people carrying signs?

173
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,986
Satoshi, why don't you get to the point already?

174
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,805
Peaceful student activism.

175
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:03,731
You see, the kind of on-campus violence Chitanda presents
in her hypothesis wasn't even a thing yet in the 60s,

176
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,495
at least not around here, anyway.

177
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,737
We were fighting against "The Man" back then:

178
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,016
The system and the state.

179
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,795
There wasn't any animosity toward
the teachers or the schools.

180
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:13,901
Don't try to make it sound like you were there.

181
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,125
I obviously wasn't,

182
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,976
but I did some in-depth research.

183
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:17,934
You're right.

184
00:10:18,022 --> 00:10:20,719
I didn't take the social climate of the time into account.

185
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,609
I'm really sorry, Chi!

186
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,500
What are you apologizing for, Mayaka?

187
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:28,395
The information I found in my research
doesn't support your theory, either.

188
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,872
I wanted to wait my turn, so I didn't say anything,

189
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,915
but my info refutes your claim.

190
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:35,750
Damn it, Ibara, you just let me waste my breath?

191
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:39,349
No worries, I think it's safe to withdraw
my theory for right now, so Mayaka,

192
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,410
why don't you share your findings with the group?

193
00:10:41,435 --> 00:10:43,130
Is that all right with you guys?

194
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:43,675
Sure thing.

195
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:44,267
Yeah!

196
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:47,621
Ugh! Aw, man, my butt is falling asleep.

197
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:51,115
This might be rude,
but your estate is ginormous, Chitanda.

198
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,641
Do you have a pond in your gardens?

199
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,933
Yep, we sure do!

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,541
Really? I'd love to check it out.
Would that be cool with you?

201
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:58,385
Ooh, yeah, I wanna see it, too!

202
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,776
Okay, why don't we move the meeting outside, then?

203
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,625
It's such a lovely day to sit out on the veranda!

204
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:06,877
A pond? Wow.

205
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:22,522
This is a copy of a booklet I found in the library,

206
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:24,969
called <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> , Issue One.

207
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:27,536
I couldn't find issues two or higher, though.

208
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,681
It was published 45 years ago, the same as Chi's.

209
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,667
"Our valiant activism?" Really?

210
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,209
That sounds so old-fashioned.

211
00:11:35,757 --> 00:11:37,251
Okay, let's dive in.

212
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,128
"We," in this case, refers to the students,

213
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:43,458
while the terms, "reactionary forces" and
"authoritarians" refer to the teachers.

214
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,390
The previous June, there was some kind of conflict,

215
00:11:46,445 --> 00:11:50,591
and Jun Sekitani, the president of
the Classic Lit Club, spearheaded it.

216
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,954
The students, under his leadership, engaged in what
they called "activism" by sticking it to the teachers.

217
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:57,138
Interesting.

218
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:59,569
I wonder what their methods of protesting were.

219
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:02,896
This <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> stuff
seems a little silly, doesn't it?

220
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:04,813
What do you mean by that?

221
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:05,958
I'm not knocking it.

222
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:10,317
I just think it makes a presumably common high
school complaint out to be on par with a legitimate,

223
00:12:10,342 --> 00:12:11,788
real-world protest, ya know?

224
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:13,934
So does that have any bearing on this research?

225
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,459
Nope, I'm just thinkin' out loud!

226
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:16,999
Sorry for interrupting you guys.

227
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,565
All right, any questions, or can we keep going?

228
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,426
Well, here's my hypothesis.

229
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,856
Like I said, Chi's theory doesn't work.

230
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,995
According to <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> ,

231
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:29,291
the incident in question happened in June.

232
00:12:29,387 --> 00:12:31,793
As for what Sekitani did to get expelled,

233
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,731
violence is what comes to mind, right?

234
00:12:33,882 --> 00:12:38,083
So in other words, he and the students
he inspired got themselves all riled up.

235
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,750
And they let the teachers have it!

236
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:44,546
There isn't any evidence he actually hit anyone, though.

237
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,891
Something happened that threatened
to take away the students' freedom,

238
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:51,417
so they must have rallied together to
fight against that perceived injustice.

239
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:53,324
And my uncle was their leader?

240
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,258
Hmm...

241
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,674
I'm almost completely on board
with your hypothesis, I think.

242
00:12:57,806 --> 00:12:58,863
Why "almost?"

243
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:02,740
To sum up, your theory is that the students
resorted to violent resistance in protest

244
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,353
of some sort of oppression by the teachers, is that it?

245
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,863
Yeah, pretty much.

246
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:08,944
It's a decent hypothesis, overall.

247
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,694
But honestly, I think it's a
little too vague to fit the bill.

248
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:15,125
Well, my theory doesn't mention anything specific,
that's for sure.

249
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,556
But are there flaws in it?

250
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,116
Uh-huh.

251
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:20,863
Both <i>Hyouka</i> and <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i>
claim the incident occurred in June,

252
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,208
but we know he wasn't expelled until October.

253
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:25,938
If he had led some violent uprising against the teachers,

254
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,813
he would have been expelled immediately.

255
00:13:27,838 --> 00:13:28,644
Fine, then.

256
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:31,791
Yeah, I'm curious about why they'd
wait four months to expel him, too.

257
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:34,463
In <i>Hyouka</i> , it states that it
had been a year since he left,

258
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,942
and it was published in October,
so that must be accurate.

259
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,207
Okay, guys, I get it. My theory doesn't work.

260
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:42,670
I think you're on the right
track with the protest, though.

261
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,901
Yeah, I agree.

262
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:46,959
Well then, I guess that means it's
the end of my turn, doesn't it?

263
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:48,750
Yes. Thank you for your input!

264
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:50,078
Okay, moving on...

265
00:13:50,277 --> 00:13:51,187
Sorry.

266
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,373
Sounds like my stomach wants to contribute.

267
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,333
Geez.

268
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:55,868
You just ate a bunch of junk food.

269
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,907
Yeah.

270
00:13:57,184 --> 00:13:59,545
I can make you some <i>onigiri</i> if you want.

271
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:01,523
What about you guys? Sound good?

272
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,327
Hey, Chi, do you need any help with those?

273
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,130
No, I'm fine, but thanks for asking.

274
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:21,927
You sure?

275
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:22,570
Uh-huh!

276
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:27,725
Handmade snacks, bro!

277
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,166
Calm down, weirdo.

278
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:31,701
Wait, Fuku. Doesn't this--?

279
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:33,619
Mayaka! I'm sorry!

280
00:14:33,849 --> 00:14:37,687
According to this data,
your hypothesis can't be accurate, not even a little bit.

281
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:39,191
I forgot to say it earlier.

282
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:40,613
Fine, whatever.

283
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:43,151
Hm?

284
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,515
Is this the Kami High Monthly Newsletter?

285
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:49,303
I just remembered Togaito mentioning
they were approaching the 500th issue.

286
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:50,416
Yeah, he's right.

287
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:52,016
There are about 500.

288
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:56,279
I took a quick look through almost all of the back issues,
but my research didn't turn up very much.

289
00:14:56,359 --> 00:15:00,500
This article was all that mentioned an incident
from back then. And trust me, I looked.

290
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:02,604
Page two is a summary of what it says.

291
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,393
The first one and the last one say the same thing.

292
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,158
No violence occurred at all during the incident.

293
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,500
So Mayaka, there's proof against your theory.

294
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,208
Also, if "we" refers to all of the students,

295
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,808
it says they were in solidarity,

296
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:17,208
so the entire student body could have been involved.

297
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:21,657
At the very least it means everyone in school
supported those who actively participated.

298
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:23,754
Here you go. Thanks for waiting.

299
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:25,120
Wow!

300
00:15:25,145 --> 00:15:26,758
These look amazing, thanks!

301
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:27,345
Sure!

302
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,864
I made a few each of plum, kelp, and mustard leaf.

303
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:32,953
Help yourselves, okay?

304
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,899
Thank you for the food!

305
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:37,666
Huh? What's the matter with you?

306
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:38,711
Nothing!

307
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,458
Tasty!

308
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,041
Delicious!

309
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,708
Hey, Chitanda, is this rice
from here on your family's farm?

310
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,958
It sure is!

311
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,541
Oh. Do you guys have any questions?

312
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:57,583
Yeah, are you positive that this is the "legendary
movement" that got Jun Sekitani expelled from school?

313
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,916
This blurb doesn't seem like enough to support that.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,958
Who knows? That's all I've got.

315
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,166
That's all you've got?

316
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,083
How can we even count it as data?

317
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,708
I don't know, maybe we can't.

318
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,791
We can still consider it as
circumstantial evidence, though.

319
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:13,875
If the "Jun Sekitani Incident" and the
"Legendary Movement" were different events,

320
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,958
there would be something in there distinguishing
this as the "Legendary Movement," wouldn't there?

321
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:18,926
She's right!

322
00:16:18,974 --> 00:16:20,333
That's what I meant to say.

323
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,708
Thank you for sorting it out!

324
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,208
Hmph!

325
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,250
Okay, then what's your hypothesis?

326
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,083
Uh... Well, about that...

327
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:28,458
I'd love to hear it.

328
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,875
Unfortunately, I don't really have
one to offer to the group right now.

329
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,708
My research only uncovered enough
to correct the theory Ibara offered.

330
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,083
And besides...

331
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,875
It's not a database's function to draw conclusions.

332
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,625
I knew he'd say that.

333
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,311
--Now, then... --Thanks so much.

334
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,291
You're welcome.

335
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,345
What should I do?

336
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,208
Okay, Oreki. It's your turn now.

337
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,458
Hotaro, is this what I think it is?

338
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,666
"The Fifty-Year Progress of Kamiyama Secondary School?"

339
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,666
It is.

340
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,916
I thought there might be something in
the public record about the incident.

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,791
But now that I look at it again,

342
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,591
there's nothing at all worth mentioning to the group.

343
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:10,791
I haven't come up with a hypothesis, either.

344
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:13,375
What's going on? You're acting weird.

345
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,708
What's the matter?

346
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,875
Did you forget how you're supposed to proceed?

347
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,625
You start by presenting your research.

348
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:24,833
Does this even qualify as something
I have to do in the first place?

349
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,708
You're freakin' me out a little.

350
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,875
What's up with you?

351
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,500
Are you feeling okay?

352
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,875
Stop it!

353
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,000
Should I blow this off?

354
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,625
Whoa, you scared me!

355
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,000
Sorry, I forgot that I have some
shiitake mushrooms drying outside.

356
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
I have to bring them in out of the rain!

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,333
Do you need any help with them?

358
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,250
No, it's okay.

359
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Hey, Chitanda.

360
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,541
What is it?

361
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,583
Sorry. But would it be okay if I used your restroom?

362
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:56,778
Oh, of course.

363
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,041
Just go right through that door
and then straight down the hall.

364
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,375
You'll see it.

365
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:03,708
Are you nervous about presenting?

366
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,458
Straight down the hall.

367
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:07,541
I'll see it, she says.

368
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:09,541
Hm?

369
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,208
Well, I'm lost.

370
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,041
She's done so much research.

371
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,208
The least I can do is put my brain to work for a bit.

372
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,291
45 years ago,

373
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,083
something happened to Jun Sekitani.

374
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,250
There are four different accounts.

375
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,916
What's the common thread that ties them all together?

376
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,763
I've got to think.

377
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,916
Student activism. Nonviolent resistance.

378
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Four months between the event and his expulsion.

379
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,208
What happened to Jun Sekitani?

380
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,708
What did he do?

381
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,708
You sure were gone a long time.

382
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,416
Well, excuse me.

383
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,038
It was my turn to present my research, right?

384
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:13,166
Sorry, but I don't have a hypothesis.

385
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,333
So would it be okay if we just skip my turn?

386
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,041
We could move right on to the wrap up.

387
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:19,708
Stop playing. You figured it out, I can tell.

388
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,083
Maybe. I think I've got a general explanation.

389
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,375
You've solved the mystery, haven't you, Oreki?

390
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,958
Calm down, Chitanda, let him explain.

391
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,833
Yeah, come on, impress us.

392
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,500
You'd better not let us down now.

393
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,166
All right, but I have to explain it in stages.

394
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,291
First, let's establish the "when."

395
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,458
Well, we know it happened 45 years ago, for starters.

396
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:44,666
If we trust both <i>Hyouka</i> and <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> ,

397
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,791
then we know the incident took place in June,

398
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,250
but that our hero left in October.

399
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,516
Next, the "where."

400
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:53,416
We all know it happened at our own Kamiyama High School.

401
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,250
As for the "Who," according to <i>Solidarity and Salutes</i> ,

402
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,375
our main player is Jun Sekitani,

403
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,375
president of the Classic Lit Club.

404
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,125
From the Kami High Monthly Newsletter,

405
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,541
we learned that the entire
student body was somehow involved.

406
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,000
Now for the "why."

407
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:11,416
It makes the most sense that the students would
rise up in solidarity against the teachers.

408
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,716
To borrow from Ibara,

409
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,982
the students likely rose up because something
happened and they thought it threatened their freedom.

410
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,000
And the event that caused the whole problem was...

411
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,583
...the cultural festival.

412
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:27,791
Where did it say in any of the research that
the cultural festival was the cause of it?

413
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
It didn't, but just hear me out for a minute.

414
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:33,708
In June, the teachers and students met
to discuss the details of the festival.

415
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,625
And they decided that the event would
be held four months later, in October.

416
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:39,125
Are you referring to this part,

417
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:42,250
where it says, "meeting to consider the cultural festival?

418
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,041
Exactly. Now take another look at it.

419
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,375
Hmm...

420
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,208
There are circles and squares marked at
the top of each entry in the calendar.

421
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,238
I've got it!

422
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,541
The squares are recurring events that happen every year,

423
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,333
but the circles are things that only took place that year!

424
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,180
That's right.

425
00:20:57,244 --> 00:21:00,125
The same notation appears on
calendars for other years, too.

426
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:04,666
This is the only year that they held a meeting to
discuss the cultural festival, but why is that?

427
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,916
I bet that 45 years ago, the student body demanded it.

428
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,541
I found a clue in <i>Hyouka</i> .

429
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,577
Right here.

430
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:15,191
"In the past year, senpai has gone
from being a hero to a legend.

431
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:19,166
The cultural festival will continue its five-day
run, in spite of everything."

432
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,565
I think the key words here are "five-day run,"
especially with the "in spite of everything."

433
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:24,958
What does that mean?

434
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:29,541
The length of the cultural festival is what
Jun Sekitani was fighting the teachers for.

435
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:34,772
I'm just guessing, but combine that with this mention of
the principal placing heightened emphasis on academics.

436
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,000
I believe that the administration was trying to shorten
the length of the festival against the kids' wishes.

437
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:44,125
I could imagine that throwing the
whole student body into a burning rage.

438
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,041
That was the motivation, I bet. The "why."

439
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,750
As for the incident itself, let's talk about that.

440
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,664
The "how."

441
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:53,429
The "valiant activism," which was popular at the time,

442
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:57,541
was carried out by none other than
Classic Lit Club president Jun Sekitani.

443
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,958
This leads us to the ultimate question: the "what."

444
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,833
The students did not engage in violence;

445
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,750
instead, they most likely decided to boycott class.

446
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:08,501
With no one to teach, the school had to
acquiesce and meet with the students,

447
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,250
deciding to abandon the plan
to shorten the festival.

448
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,375
But someone had to pay,
and thus Sekitani was expelled.

449
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,829
So why did so much time pass
between the event and the expulsion?

450
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,333
Well, if he'd been kicked out in June,

451
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,666
while tempers were hot, it would've made things worse.

452
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,041
So they probably waited until after the festival,

453
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,750
when the hype had died down a bit.

454
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,958
That's all I've got for the wrap-up.

455
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,291
Now I finally know.

456
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:41,250
That's what happened to him?

457
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,125
Excellent work. That was really impressive.

458
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:51,291
Yeah, you've really outdone
yourself with that one, Hotaro.

459
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,524
It all adds up, huh?

460
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:55,956
Why does he get it every time?
It's so freaking annoying!

461
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,567
It came to me.

462
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:01,041
Do either of you have objections to his theory?

463
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,250
None here!

464
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:05,458
I hate to admit it, but I think he's right.

465
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:10,541
Well, in that case, let's focus this year's Classic
Lit Club anthology on proving Oreki's theory.

466
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,583
We'll get started on that a little bit later in the term.

467
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,916
On that note, I guess this meeting is adjourned.

468
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,666
Thank you for your hard work!

469
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:21,541
I can't express how much I appreciate this.

470
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,750
It's not like I did it all by myself, you know.

471
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,916
That's true.

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,926
But you're the one who found the answer.

473
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:29,125
I'll get your umbrella back to you at school.

474
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,875
Well... See ya.

475
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,864
Although...

476
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:57,000
Would hearing that story as a child
really have made me cry as much as I did?

477
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,873
Next time:

478
00:25:36,944 --> 00:25:39,458
"The Truth About the Historic Classic Lit Club."
