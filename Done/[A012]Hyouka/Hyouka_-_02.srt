1
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,177
"Hey, Little Bro.

2
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:30,153
How are you?

3
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:33,278
I'm still in Varanasi. Congrats on passing!

4
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,993
Sorry this is late.

5
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:38,570
I hear you ended up going to Kami High, my alma mater!

6
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:40,692
Now that you're officially in high school,

7
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:43,209
let me give you some sisterly advice.

8
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:46,505
Join the Classic Lit Club.

9
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:51,031
It's one of the oldest clubs the school
has, and I was in it my whole time there.

10
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:55,532
From what I've been told, it
doesn't have a single member right now!

11
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:59,685
If no one new joins this year, the
Executive Committee will do away with it!

12
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:03,023
As one of the veterans, I
couldn't bear to see that happen.

13
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,306
Please, Hotaro.

14
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:09,902
Join the Classic Lit club, and help keep the legacy alive.

15
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:12,527
My adolescent memories are at stake!

16
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,456
It's not like you have anything better to do, right?

17
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:18,620
Sincerely, your sister, Tomoe."

18
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,549
1, 2, 3, 4!

19
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,373
It's been a month since we saved the Classic Lit Club.

20
00:02:54,527 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm starting to feel at home
in the Earth Science prep room.

21
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:57,423
Good afternoon.

22
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,616
When I get bored after school, it's the first place I go.

23
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:04,191
I never expected to feel that way
in there, but I'm not complaining.

24
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:07,482
Want some?

25
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,791
I brought some snacks from home.

26
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:12,095
You're welcome to whatever you want.

27
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:13,271
Thank you.

28
00:03:14,144 --> 00:03:17,013
It's not that I ever disliked
spending time with other people.

29
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:19,875
As long as they weren't the
kind who wore me out or anything.

30
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:41,922
It's pointless.

31
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:43,996
Yeah, is life like a dull pencil?

32
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:46,022
What? What are you talking about?

33
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,764
Was that supposed to be a joke?

34
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:50,996
Yeah, sorry.

35
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,292
Look. I'm not in the mood for jokes now!

36
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,069
'Kay, fine then.

37
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,277
I said it's pointless!

38
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:57,526
What?

39
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,294
All the time we've been wasting in here after
school every day, doing absolutely nothing productive!

40
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,902
I don't have a problem with that.

41
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:09,539
But is there something specific you want
to do with your time in the Classic Lit Club?

42
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,732
Yeah, there is.

43
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:11,383
Oh?

44
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,686
But... That's more of a personal matter.

45
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,338
She's said that before.

46
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,205
Right now I'm talking about something different.

47
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,637
If we're going to be a legit
club, we need some good activities.

48
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,219
That's pointless.

49
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:24,832
Wait, hear me out.

50
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:28,512
Let's submit an anthology to the cultural festival!

51
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,759
Seriously?

52
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:30,218
Yep.

53
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,015
Let's not. Sounds like a ton of work.

54
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,280
No, we have to have an anthology!

55
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:37,759
Look, if you really want to participate in the festival,

56
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,419
there are much easier ways to do it.

57
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:40,849
Like concessions.

58
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:45,110
Kami High's cultural festival has never
allowed students to sell concessions.

59
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:50,938
Anyway, they'll give us a budget for an anthology, and
our advising teacher has requested that we create one.

60
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:56,302
Also, it's been a tradition for this club to
create one for the festival for the past four decades.

61
00:04:56,349 --> 00:04:57,645
They don't want to break that.

62
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,998
Well then, why didn't you mention all that sooner?

63
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,586
That means we have to do it.

64
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,116
Great!

65
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:06,368
So what is this anthology supposed to contain, anyway?

66
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,378
I have no idea!

67
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,046
Are you kidding me?

68
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:11,110
Yeah, sorry.

69
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:13,742
I thought that you and I could look into it together.

70
00:05:13,876 --> 00:05:18,134
I figured if there were any anthologies from
previous years lying around, we could start there.

71
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,651
Why don't we search for them?

72
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:30,956
I give up.

73
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,576
Maybe they're in the library.

74
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,129
Let's check it out!

75
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,164
Why are you still sitting there?

76
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,538
You're coming with me.

77
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:42,802
Get up.

78
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,539
I'm not in the mood for this.

79
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:55,181
It's Friday, which means that
it's her shift on library duty.

80
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,414
Well, well. It's Oreki.

81
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,106
Long time no see. Can't say I've missed you.

82
00:06:01,243 --> 00:06:03,547
Hey, Ibara. Nice to see you, too.

83
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:05,707
This is the sacred realm of knowledge.

84
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,861
Your presence here defiles all that.

85
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:08,591
Oh, yeah?

86
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,672
I'm floored they'd leave you in charge of books.

87
00:06:10,697 --> 00:06:12,039
Do you even know how to read?

88
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,564
You haven't changed at all.

89
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,512
If you came to insult me, then you should just leave.

90
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,821
'Scuse me.

91
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:20,262
Hey, Hotaro! How's it going?

92
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,897
Looks like you two are as close as always.

93
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:25,704
Seems about right for the cutest couple in middle school!

94
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:26,773
Ridiculous.

95
00:06:26,798 --> 00:06:30,098
Don't be disgusting. I'd rather
date a slug than this lowlife.

96
00:06:30,186 --> 00:06:31,283
Out of your league.

97
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,887
Over the line, Fukube!

98
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,177
And you've got a lot of nerve making a
joke when you're well aware how I feel.

99
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,064
Ah, I'm sorry, Mayaka.

100
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:39,465
Hurt your feelings?

101
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:43,374
Do you even care that you're
pouring salt into my wounds? Not cool.

102
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,900
Seriously. Have a heart, okay?

103
00:06:47,356 --> 00:06:49,524
I don't understand what's going on here.

104
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,463
She's had an enormous crush
on him ever since middle school.

105
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,551
Oh!

106
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:55,197
Ahem.

107
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:58,286
Chitanda, I'd like you to meet Mayaka Ibara.

108
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,750
We all went to Kaburaya Middle School together.

109
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,378
Nice to meet you!

110
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:04,985
Mayaka, this is Eru Chitanda.

111
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,044
She's president of the Classic
Lit club, which I joined recently.

112
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:08,914
Yes, indeed.

113
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,466
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

114
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:13,700
So anyway, what brings you two to the library?

115
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:15,281
Oh, right, I almost forgot!

116
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:16,712
So, uh, Ibara...

117
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,581
I was wondering if you might be able to help us.

118
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,540
I'll try.

119
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:22,439
Does the library happen to have any old club anthologies?

120
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:24,648
Like Classic Lit Club, maybe?

121
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,078
Let me see.

122
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,397
I don't think so, actually.

123
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:30,772
At least not out here, but maybe in the back.

124
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:32,006
Oh, okay.

125
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:33,705
So why are you looking for them?

126
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:37,042
We've decided our club should
make one for the culture festival.

127
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,919
So we wanted to look at past
anthologies to get some ideas.

128
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:40,697
Oh, yeah?

129
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:42,365
Are we gonna present it at Kanyasai?

130
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:44,471
I can't believe Hotaro agreed to that.

131
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,893
I was pressured into it, as a matter of fact.

132
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:48,772
"Kanyasai?"

133
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,897
Abbreviation.

134
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,241
Kamiyama High Cultural Festival.

135
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,339
Is this another one of those
terms you make up and try to coin?

136
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,481
No, for real!

137
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:59,378
That's what everyone here in
the school calls it, not just me!

138
00:07:59,772 --> 00:08:00,421
Right?

139
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,247
Yeah, "Kanyasai" is what they call it in Manga Club.

140
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,475
"Kanya"?

141
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,112
Wait, how do they spell that, anyway?

142
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:08,211
I have no idea.

143
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,545
I've asked around but I haven't gotten an answer.

144
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,266
I bet it started as, Kamiyama High
Bunkasai, then shortened to, Kamiyama-sai.

145
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,387
Kaynama-sai. Kanyasai.

146
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:19,039
That's my hypothesis, but who knows?

147
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,522
Anyway, Chitanda.

148
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:23,813
There might be some old anthologies
back in the storage stacks.

149
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:28,356
But the librarian is in a meeting right now,
and we can't get back there unless she unlocks it.

150
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:31,935
I think her meeting will be
done in about 30 minutes or so.

151
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,048
Wanna wait?

152
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:34,254
What should we do?

153
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:35,354
We should wait.

154
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:37,432
You could always leave and come back.

155
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:39,498
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,064
Wait! Hotaro, hold up!

157
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:42,925
Hey, Mayaka.

158
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:45,527
You should tell these guys the
story that you told me earlier.

159
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:46,481
Huh?!

160
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,564
Hmph. Okay, fine.

161
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:51,713
Oreki.

162
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,575
Do you feel like using your
tiny brain for once in your life?

163
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,142
Nope.

164
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,826
What story are you going to tell?

165
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:59,113
It's called the "Most Favored Book of Disfavor."

166
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,949
"The Most Favored Book of Disfavor"?

167
00:09:00,997 --> 00:09:02,747
It's quite a peculiar tale.

168
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:05,367
No matter how I slice it, it doesn't seem to add up.

169
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,298
It's got Mayaka and me pretty much stumped.

170
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,960
Please, tell us all of the details!

171
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:14,481
I report here for duty every
Friday after school, you know?

172
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,864
And every week, the same book
gets returned, like clockwork.

173
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:19,716
Today makes five weeks in a row.

174
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,481
That, in and of itself, is kinda weird, right?

175
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:23,800
This is the book.

176
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,326
Wow, what a gorgeous book!

177
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:27,997
It's huge.

178
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:29,940
Is it okay if I look inside?

179
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,112
Go ahead.

180
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,308
Oreki, you should see this.

181
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,233
It's about the school's history, huh?

182
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,925
I can't believe how dense it is.

183
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:46,698
This would be a lot of work to read.

184
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:51,067
It's not weird for someone to check this out every week.

185
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,205
They'd never finish.

186
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:55,222
You've obviously never borrowed from the school's library.

187
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,856
The check-out period here is a
full two weeks, instead of just one.

188
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:01,499
So why would someone need to get it more often than that?

189
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:05,027
Nevertheless, someone always does,
and turns it in every week, too.

190
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:07,402
Do you have a record of the borrowers?

191
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:08,516
Yeah, of course!

192
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:10,331
The checkout list is in the front cover.

193
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:11,042
See?

194
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:15,617
Huh? Oreki, this is odd!

195
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,519
Each Friday, a different person checks this book out,

196
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,536
but they always bring it back that same day!

197
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:21,921
Exactly.

198
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:26,756
This giant book has been checked out and
returned every Friday, for five weeks in a row now.

199
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:28,434
Even the times are consistent.

200
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:32,367
All five kids have come to get it
during lunch and returned it after school.

201
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,606
What do you think?

202
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,013
You're curious, right?

203
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:36,648
Yes.

204
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,492
I just... I have to know!

205
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:46,938
Let's try to figure this out, Oreki.

206
00:10:46,986 --> 00:10:47,809
You want to?

207
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:51,689
Damn you, Satoshi. You knew this would happen
when you stopped me from leaving, didn't you?

208
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:55,189
I mean, you did such a great job
solving that locked door mystery.

209
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:58,013
And then there was that strange
business with the secret club.

210
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,768
Wait, what are you talking about?

211
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:03,240
She would be referring to a rather
provocative facet of Hotaro, here.

212
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:05,064
Stop, you're making it sound dirty!

213
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,457
In any case, this is curious, right?

214
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:09,619
No, it's not.

215
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,485
Yes, it is!

216
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:12,731
Is not!

217
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,785
Enough!

218
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:16,810
Be quiet. Both of you.

219
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:18,447
Right.

220
00:11:18,662 --> 00:11:19,731
Sorry.

221
00:11:19,902 --> 00:11:21,147
I got reckless.

222
00:11:21,231 --> 00:11:24,664
Any further refusal could result in
a careless waste of precious energy.

223
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:25,946
That can't happen.

224
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,495
With that in mind...

225
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,231
Yeah, all right.

226
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,906
I guess I will think about it, okay?

227
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:33,827
Great!

228
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:39,286
Fukube...

229
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,143
Has Oreki ever been smart in his life?

230
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,664
No, not like us.

231
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,783
But he does have a knack for solving problems,

232
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,571
which can come in handy sometimes.

233
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:49,041
Hey, don't talk about me like I'm not here.

234
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:57,130
For five weeks straight, different people have
checked this book out, and returned it a few hours later.

235
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:02,881
Lesser minds might shrug it off as a coincidence,
but Chitanda wouldn't be content with that answer.

236
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:04,981
The truth isn't what matters here.

237
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:08,380
What's important is satisfying her burning curiosity.

238
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,739
Now, then...

239
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,693
Borrowing the book at lunch hour,

240
00:12:11,718 --> 00:12:14,996
then returning it after school
doesn't allow sufficient time to read it.

241
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,143
If they didn't want to lug around such a tome,

242
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,843
they could just read it in the
library without borrowing it.

243
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:24,147
Conclusion: This book is not being
utilized for literary purposes at all.

244
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,772
They're not reading it.

245
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,536
What does that mean?

246
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,546
If a book's not being used for reading,

247
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,302
what other purpose could it serve?

248
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:34,184
If you stack them up, they make decent pillows.

249
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,564
They make good shields in combat, too.

250
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:38,586
Are you ever serious about anything?

251
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:42,569
He's right; These people can't be reading
it, so what could they be doing with that book?

252
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,467
Well Chitanda, what do you think?

253
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:46,556
Let me see.

254
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,869
Someone could use them as weights in a workout.

255
00:12:49,971 --> 00:12:51,855
You guys are no help at all.

256
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,517
Is Chitanda really as smart as everyone claims she is?

257
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,410
She seems like a total doofus to me.

258
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:01,969
Let's try something else.

259
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,264
What does it mean that a different
person borrows this book every week?

260
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:08,196
Well, from the names, we can guess that they're all girls.

261
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,135
This brings up two possibilities:

262
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,525
The girls have no connection.

263
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,872
It's en vogue to have this book on Friday afternoons,

264
00:13:13,897 --> 00:13:16,856
so they've all checked it out on
different occasions by coincidence.

265
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,644
Or, the five of them use the book together, as a group,

266
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,646
and they each take turns being
the one to borrow it every Friday.

267
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,317
"En vogue," huh?

268
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,965
For fortunetelling!

269
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,264
Right, like...

270
00:13:28,564 --> 00:13:32,071
This book will be your lucky
charm on Friday, so take it with you!

271
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,326
If you check it out during your lunch period,

272
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:37,863
and return it after school, your
boyfriend will plant a kiss on you!

273
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:38,817
Heck yeah!

274
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:39,770
Astounding.

275
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:41,897
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

276
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,885
I'm just brainstorming here.

277
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:48,580
All they have in common is that they're girls
and second years, though all in different classes.

278
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:52,269
Why would the fact that they're all
girls have anything to do with this book?

279
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:53,651
Who knows, it might not.

280
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,366
Think about it:

281
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,883
If you randomly selected five students from this school,

282
00:13:56,915 --> 00:13:59,147
there's a pretty decent chance they would all be female.

283
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:02,500
It's also pretty common for members
of the same sex to stick together.

284
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,356
Well, what if they're using it for some kind of code?

285
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,634
Like if they return it facing
up, it has a particular meaning.

286
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,826
Face down, then it means something else?

287
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:14,838
I don't think that would be a very effective code at all.

288
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:17,064
You see?

289
00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,048
She's right.

290
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,550
Any face-up, face-down code would be lost in there.

291
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,027
Hmm...

292
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,814
Well, no matter how hard he thinks,

293
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,802
Oreki's not gonna figure it out.

294
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:29,037
After all, Fukube and I racked
our brains and couldn't get it.

295
00:14:30,356 --> 00:14:31,737
Hey, what's wrong?

296
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,018
It has a peculiar smell.

297
00:14:34,137 --> 00:14:35,248
Wait, it does?

298
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:39,516
I don't smell anything.

299
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,287
I swear, it stinks.

300
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:43,266
There's some sort of acrid odor.

301
00:14:43,385 --> 00:14:44,609
It's like paint thinner.

302
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,983
It's unmistakable.

303
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:48,200
Is she a dog?

304
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:53,642
Well, if Chitanda insists she smells something strange on
that thing, then it's worth looking into, don't you think?

305
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:55,637
What could that mean?

306
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:01,108
Hotaro, if you've cracked it open, then you gotta say so.

307
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,265
Huh? Did you get it?

308
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,115
Calm down.

309
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,648
Maybe, but I'm not sure.

310
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,376
Hey, Chitanda, you wanna get some exercise?

311
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,541
There's a lead I want you to investigate.

312
00:15:09,696 --> 00:15:11,115
Let's get right on it!

313
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:13,475
No, I'm not going this time.

314
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,508
It's just you.

315
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,185
Just me? Don't you need to go?

316
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,415
Well, I, uh...

317
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:21,085
Yeah, good job, Chitanda!

318
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,168
Hotaro has got no right to use you like that!

319
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:27,458
He's at his best when you're
the one taking advantage of him!

320
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,024
I'm not using anyone!

321
00:15:29,064 --> 00:15:30,850
Oh, no, it's not like that.

322
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,075
I just figured we'd investigate together.

323
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,876
Right. That makes sense.

324
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,497
What are you waiting for then, huh?

325
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,554
Let's get going!

326
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:45,311
Thank you so much for coming.

327
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,481
We're honored to serve you.

328
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,457
We have prepared two fine menus for you tonight.

329
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:52,260
Which one would you prefer?

330
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,585
I recommend... this dish for you.

331
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:15,928
This might end up costing you more than you think.

332
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,428
Are you okay?

333
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:23,755
Let's go.

334
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:26,892
After all, gym class got rained out today.

335
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,013
So I think I have exactly enough energy to spare.

336
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:30,625
Great!

337
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:34,203
What kind of guy your age has such a deficit of energy?

338
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,525
Shut up.

339
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:37,014
All right, come on, then.

340
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:37,822
Right.

341
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:39,134
Hold on.

342
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,597
I'm going with you.

343
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:42,542
I'm kinda curious.

344
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:45,310
Fukube, would you watch the desk till I get back?

345
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:45,966
Huh?

346
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:49,303
I mean, I can't just walk away
from my library duty, right?

347
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,386
You hold down the fort. Later.

348
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:52,893
Don't have too much fun.

349
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,394
So where are you taking us to investigate now, Oreki?

350
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,837
To check out the art room.

351
00:16:58,925 --> 00:17:00,500
Whoa, all the way over there?

352
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,672
Yep, it's far,

353
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:03,775
which is why I didn't want to go in the first place.

354
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:06,623
You have to be the laziest person I have ever met.

355
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:07,865
What's in the art room?

356
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,057
First let's set a few things straight.

357
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:14,125
I'm willing to bet none of those girls would
have time to get any use out of that book on a break.

358
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:15,786
It's too enormous for that.

359
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:19,323
Which means that they could only really
do anything with it during class time.

360
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:23,032
What are the only classes made up
of students who are in the same year,

361
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:24,668
but in different homerooms?

362
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:26,981
Gym and all of the fine arts subjects, right?

363
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,012
Yep.

364
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:29,921
So every week before class,

365
00:17:29,952 --> 00:17:32,772
those five girls have each taken
turns to come borrow the book.

366
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,276
I still don't understand the timing, though.

367
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:37,981
I mean, they could check it
out for two weeks if they wanted.

368
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:39,147
The book is huge,

369
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:42,356
so they probably just want it
for class rather than lug it around.

370
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,031
Oh, that makes sense.

371
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,772
What is it?

372
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,766
It's the same smell as the book!

373
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:49,997
Seriously?

374
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,085
Look in the room and you'll see why.

375
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,497
There's the answer to your little mystery.

376
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,351
The second-year combined D, E, and F classes

377
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:03,696
are just using it in art as a prop
when they model for portrait painting.

378
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:07,649
The book's binding makes it an ideal, picturesque motif.

379
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:10,828
It was the smell of paint. Not thinner.

380
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,022
How did you figure it out?

381
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:15,379
Huh? What do you mean?

382
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,981
It came to me, I guess.

383
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,720
I just got lucky.

384
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,630
Wow, nicely done, my friend!

385
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:30,253
Students using it as a prop for art class
is the last thing I ever would have imagined.

386
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,356
I still don't know how you did it.

387
00:18:32,508 --> 00:18:34,122
You're just... weird.

388
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,423
No, I'm not.

389
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,841
I'm probably the most normal person at this school.

390
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,120
Well... That's a bit strong.

391
00:18:40,326 --> 00:18:43,489
Still, that's some really
impressive detective work, Oreki.

392
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:46,891
I'm completely fascinated by what
goes on inside that head of yours.

393
00:18:46,963 --> 00:18:47,694
"Fascinated"?

394
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,551
Yes!

395
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:52,253
I'd just love to crack open your skull
and pick your brain sometime, you know?

396
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,502
That sounds like a horror movie to me.

397
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,857
Plus, to an honor student like you,
it's not that remarkable of a brain.

398
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:01,494
Oh, yeah? You're an honor student?

399
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:02,831
Let me put it this way:

400
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:05,081
We haven't had midterms yet, but I'm sure when we do,

401
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:07,486
Chitanda's gonna be at the top of our class!

402
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:08,403
No way.

403
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:13,650
It doesn't matter how good my grades are.
That can't compare at all to his raw ability.

404
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:19,265
Taking little clues and piecing them together
into a lead that actually pans out is just incredible.

405
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:20,941
Huh...

406
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,414
Well, on that note...

407
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,876
Her senses of smell and hearing fascinate me.

408
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,038
They're what solved this mystery and the last.

409
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,762
Oreki might even... be able to...

410
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:30,897
Hmm?

411
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,781
Uh... Oh! Uh... Nothing.

412
00:19:34,154 --> 00:19:35,219
Anyway...

413
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:37,921
I had fun with this, even though I missed the best part.

414
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:39,136
What about you?

415
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,765
Yeah, I had a blast!

416
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:42,902
The afternoon flew by before I knew it!

417
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:46,849
I spent hours gripping over it
and I still couldn't even get close!

418
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:48,789
It's so frustrating!

419
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,476
Didn't I tell you he could come in handy once in a while?

420
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:54,280
I can't stand the thought of being outdone by Oreki!

421
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,198
My stupid life is over now. Finished!

422
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:57,548
Come on, it's not that bad!

423
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:58,246
It's odd.

424
00:19:58,946 --> 00:20:00,943
Something just doesn't feel right.

425
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:04,474
I can't ever see myself acting like they are right now.

426
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,045
Why is that?

427
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,388
Is there something wrong with me?

428
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,372
Yeah, I know what you mean.

429
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:13,872
Once he's got the scent, there's a brilliant
flash, and in an instant he knows everything!

430
00:20:13,897 --> 00:20:15,634
Oreki, you can't leave yet!

431
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,651
Why not?

432
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:18,599
Oh, right. The anthologies.

433
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:20,997
Yeah, we have to wait till the librarian gets back.

434
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:23,522
Hotaro does kind of zone out sometimes, huh?

435
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,397
Not just sometimes.

436
00:20:25,566 --> 00:20:27,417
He's always out to lunch.

437
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:30,317
Ibara, thank you for watching the desk for me.

438
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,481
You're free to go now.

439
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,491
Oh, good. It was my pleasure, Miss Itoigawa.

440
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:37,514
Ma'am. My name is Satoshi Fukube.

441
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,814
We're from the Classic Lit Club, and
we hoped you might be able to help us.

442
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,022
Where could we find the old anthologies?

443
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:47,073
Classic Lit? Anthologies?

444
00:20:47,368 --> 00:20:49,836
You're in the Classic Literature Club?

445
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:55,856
Well, unfortunately, we don't currently have any
of the back-numbered issues anywhere in the stacks.

446
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,272
Are you sure about that?

447
00:20:57,497 --> 00:21:00,356
If they were here, son, trust me, I would know.

448
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,689
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm busy.

449
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,282
Huh. Well, thank you anyway.

450
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,632
I guess we're out of luck, Chitanda.

451
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,761
This is a big problem.

452
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,570
We'll find them soon enough.

453
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:19,522
So, Oreki.

454
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:23,183
Was it frustrating not being
able to solve a problem for once?

455
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:23,981
Not really.

456
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,195
Whatever.

457
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,513
That's that, then. We should go home.

458
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:30,272
I did learn something helpful today, though.

459
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:31,468
Yeah, what's that?

460
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,794
Nothing. It's a personal matter.

461
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:35,352
Oh, that again, huh?

462
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:36,932
Yeah.

463
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,835
Knowing Oreki, it might be possible after all.

464
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,085
Hello? This is Oreki.

465
00:21:51,307 --> 00:21:54,017
Good morning. Um, it's Chitanda.

466
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,314
Chitanda?

467
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,159
Yeah, um, I'm sorry if I woke you up.

468
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:01,008
Did I?

469
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,354
Oh, no.

470
00:22:02,444 --> 00:22:04,527
I thought it might be my sister or something.

471
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,087
So why are you calling on a Sunday?

472
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:10,938
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,735
But I'd like to see you today, if that's possible.

474
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:17,675
There's something I really want to talk to you about.

475
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:31,127
She's late.

476
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:46,460
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

477
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:48,311
I rushed right over.

478
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:50,645
Uh-huh.

479
00:23:07,992 --> 00:23:10,251
So, was there something you wanted to talk about?

480
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:11,099
Huh?

481
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:15,133
I'm just curious as to why you wanted
to meet me here at this weird coffee shop.

482
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:21,405
You're the one who recommended this place, not me, Oreki.

483
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:22,835
Later.

484
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,809
Huh? No, please don't go.

485
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,840
It's my precious Sunday to do nothing.

486
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:29,297
I won't waste it sitting in this
place with you, playing these games.

487
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:30,511
Look, I'm sorry!

488
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:33,547
It's just that...

489
00:23:33,638 --> 00:23:35,226
I'm really nervous, okay?

490
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:39,049
What is there to be so nervous about?

491
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,196
Are you about to make a confession?

492
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:45,041
Tell me that you love me?

493
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:54,964
There may be something I'd like to confess to you, yes.

494
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:55,781
Huh?

495
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:36,896
Next time:

496
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,797
"The Circumstances of the Classic Lit Club's Scion."
