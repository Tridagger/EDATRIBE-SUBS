1
00:00:01,881 --> 00:00:04,120
I appreciate the lunch and all, Sis,

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:06,726
but I have no idea what half this stuff is.

3
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:08,187
Here goes nothing.

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:14,836
We're back!

5
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:17,077
Thank you for holding down the fort.

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,797
Sure.

7
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:20,580
Anyway... we were victorious!

8
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:23,011
It did come down to the wire.

9
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:25,236
Congrats. I'm happy for you.

10
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:27,857
In a way, it's your victory too.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,114
There's no chance we could have won without your help.

12
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,425
No big deal. Really.

13
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:34,607
You know, I didn't see that coming.

14
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:36,358
It was very out of character.

15
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:39,520
Staging a dramatic rescue? I wasn't expecting that one,

16
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,014
I guess I was caught up in the festival mood.

17
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:43,603
It won't happen again.

18
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:46,725
Can you do me a favor?

19
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:49,608
There's something I would
really like you to take a look at.

20
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:52,913
Here it is.

21
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:36,841
So, somebody stole a ladle from the Cooking Club?

22
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,304
Yeah... Just the one from our table, though.

23
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:41,989
Sounds like someone has too much time on their hands.

24
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:44,165
It's not just the Cooking Club.

25
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:47,130
The same kinda thing's happened to
the Go Club and the Acapella Club.

26
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:48,743
And the Fortunetelling Club.

27
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,248
A note was left there, too!

28
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,946
Let's see... what did it say again?

29
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,710
Yeah, somebody's got way too much time on their hands.

30
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,640
Think I can finish my lunch now?

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,357
Oreki!

32
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,049
Oh, no. Here we go again.

33
00:03:01,337 --> 00:03:06,015
There's no escaping the
unbearable curiosity of Eru Chitanda.

34
00:03:06,873 --> 00:03:10,312
Who would do something like this in
the middle of the cultural festival?

35
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,768
Why are they appropriating Jumonji's name?

36
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:17,066
Why are they stealing all these random items?

37
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,982
I just... I have to know!

38
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,898
We don't have time for a new mystery.

39
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,065
We need to sell these...

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,713
Speaking of the anthologies...

41
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:27,825
...we need a new plan.

42
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:32,402
We've been publicizing them during our other
events, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good.

43
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:33,732
That's true.

44
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,940
We need to come up with something that's
going to grab more people's attention.

45
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,709
Right! That's my point.

46
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:42,690
What if we pitch this phantom
thievery to the Wall Newspaper Club?

47
00:03:42,898 --> 00:03:46,089
And maybe we can have the school
radio do a report about it too.

48
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:49,707
With that publicity, people will
be dying to read the anthology.

49
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,944
Makes sense to me.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,041
That could be exactly what we need!

51
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,171
But what kind of pitch are you going to give them?

52
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:58,078
This has nothing to do with the Classic Lit Club.

53
00:03:58,437 --> 00:03:59,842
I'm glad you asked.

54
00:04:02,186 --> 00:04:06,953
The Classic Lit Club's master detective, Hotaro
Oreki, will set out to catch the phantom thief

55
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,415
who is plaguing the festival!

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,277
To learn more about his past exploits, check
out the Classic Lit Club's anthology, <i>Hyouka</i>!

57
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,265
Who wouldn't want one after that?

58
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,354
Yeah, it was okay, I guess.

59
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:22,703
Right? We'll unmask Jumonji and
publicize the anthology at the same time!

60
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:23,631
Count me out!

61
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:25,307
What do you think I am, huh?

62
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,635
Some monkey that you can use to lure in customers? Hmph!

63
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,004
Can't we just give it a try? Pretty please?

64
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,023
Oh, come on.

65
00:04:34,077 --> 00:04:36,031
Even if I did play along with this,

66
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:38,320
there are a thousand students here.

67
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:41,403
Add in all the visitors, and
the number goes up even higher.

68
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:45,200
How are we supposed to catch
one thief out of so many people?

69
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,357
Is it that hard? Really?

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,337
Impossible.

71
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,101
Maybe if we got involved some other way.

72
00:04:57,148 --> 00:05:00,167
Like if the thief targeted the
Classic Lit Club or something.

73
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,023
Yeah. Well...

74
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:04,109
We could stage a robbery!

75
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:04,671
No way!

76
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:05,267
Kidding!

77
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,797
Really! I swear! I was just kidding.

78
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:10,187
Speaking of targets...

79
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,595
Which clubs have had things stolen so far?

80
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:18,902
Go, acapella, cooking, and I uh... I forget.

81
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:20,237
The Fortunetelling Club.

82
00:05:20,364 --> 00:05:21,047
Yeah. Right!

83
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:27,523
The Acapella Club,

84
00:05:27,872 --> 00:05:30,357
the Go Club, The Fortunetelling Club,

85
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,018
and the Cooking Club?

86
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:34,354
ABC!

87
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,824
Huh? Huh?

88
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:38,057
Hello, Suzuki?

89
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:43,070
It looks like the clubs that could go with "E" are
the Film Club, the Gardening Club, and the SF club.

90
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,731
I'm lost. What's going on?

91
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:46,488
The thefts follow a pattern.

92
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,830
And it's not an especially complex one, either.

93
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:51,498
The Acapella Club, the <i>Igo</i> Club,

94
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:52,648
the <i>Uranai</i> Club.

95
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,582
Skip a letter to the <i>Oryori</i> Club,

96
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:56,815
and if an "E" club pops up next...

97
00:05:56,912 --> 00:05:58,595
Japanese alphabetic order!

98
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,482
That would be my guess.

99
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,353
The Gardening Club has been hit.

100
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,601
They stepped out for a second and
one of their water guns was stolen.

101
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,607
A water gun?

102
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,827
Fire safety for roasting potatoes.

103
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,415
One of their members came in here with one yesterday.

104
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:12,530
Just a second.

105
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:16,375
In Christie's <i>The ABC Murders,</i> a
person whose name starts with an "A"

106
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:18,783
is killed in a town whose name starts with "A."

107
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,308
An <i>otama</i> was stolen from the <i>Oryori</i> Club.

108
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,248
Wait, hold on.

109
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,335
Right.

110
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,982
What did the Fortunetelling Club lose? Do you know?

111
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:27,232
Oh... yes!

112
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:29,731
The Wheel of Fortune. A Tarot card.

113
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:31,558
Okay. Take a look.

114
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:39,677
The Gardening Club's water pistol was an AK,

115
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:40,448
wasn't it?

116
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,273
An AK? What's that?

117
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,397
A Russian-made assault rifle.

118
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,565
So it's an AK for the <i>Engei</i>
Club, and <i>ishi</i> for the <i>Igo</i> Club?

119
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:51,302
That works. What about the Acapella Club?

120
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,690
I think we're missing the most important thing.

121
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:54,980
And what's that?

122
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:59,835
Our phantom thief's signature.

123
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,646
Yeah, it says Jumonji.

124
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,020
Does it, though?

125
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,814
Wouldn't the usual reading be "jumoji"?

126
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,596
"Tenth letter"!

127
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:11,824
A-I-U-E-O, Ka-Ki-Ku-Ke-Ko,

128
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:13,230
up to the tenth letter!

129
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,644
"Ko!" The <i>Koten</i> Club!

130
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,718
Otherwise known as the Classic Lit Club.

131
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:20,895
I don't know about you, but I'd say
that's probably enough for a pitch.

132
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,422
I need to get to the Wall Newspaper
Club and tell them about this!

133
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,021
She's pretty excited, huh?

134
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:30,498
What's wrong?

135
00:07:30,557 --> 00:07:31,050
Huh?

136
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:34,164
Oh... I just thought of something, that's all.

137
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:35,943
This whole thing...

138
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:42,402
You know, never mind. I gotta go.

139
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,337
That's weird. What's with him?

140
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Who knows?

141
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,049
Shouldn't you be getting back to the Manga Club?

142
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:53,272
Soon enough.

143
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:54,982
Hmm...

144
00:07:55,123 --> 00:07:57,847
Why? You trying to get rid of me?

145
00:07:58,273 --> 00:07:59,476
Well, are you?

146
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,326
Cranky today.

147
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:03,687
No, I am not!

148
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:09,972
The trick to negotiating.

149
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:13,150
First, make it seem like you
expect something of the other person.

150
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:16,518
Second, downplay the benefit
that you will receive from it,

151
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:20,753
and third, ask someone of the
opposite sex, away from public view.

152
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:22,126
All right!

153
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,163
On it!

154
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,516
I'll go interview the Gardening Club!

155
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:31,065
Hey! What about Acapella?

156
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:32,645
I'm calling them right now!

157
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,655
Hurry it up, will you?

158
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:38,982
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

159
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,148
Sorry about this, Chitanda,
but we're a little busy right now.

160
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,096
Think you could drop by another time?

161
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,456
Oh, okay. I'll come back later.

162
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:49,798
Actually, no!

163
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:51,999
I need to talk to you right now!

164
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,815
If it's about your club, I told
you... We need a special angle...

165
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:56,822
That's just it. We do have an angle!

166
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:58,898
Yeah? What's that?

167
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,523
I know that! Stop rushing me!

168
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,940
Never mind, let's change gears.

169
00:09:02,023 --> 00:09:03,315
What are we doing about that interview?

170
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:05,379
Do you think we could hurry this up?

171
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:06,738
I'm really...

172
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,416
Whoa! Hey!

173
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,860
Where are we going?

174
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,656
The thing is, there's some stuff going on, and I
really felt like I needed to tell someone about it.

175
00:09:18,814 --> 00:09:20,872
So... uh...

176
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,312
I came here. I trust you.

177
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,496
Oh... Yeah?

178
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,260
Thanks, I guess...?

179
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,414
But honestly, there's not much
in it for the Classic Lit Club.

180
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,074
'Kay...

181
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,815
What do you think? Can you help, Togaito?

182
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,588
Is this something you can do for me?

183
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:39,399
Uh... well...

184
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,847
Honestly, I'm a little confused.

185
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:44,269
Oh, sorry.

186
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:47,733
Anyway, like I said, we're busy right now.

187
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:49,521
Come back later after you've gathered your thoughts.

188
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:50,181
No...

189
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,761
Please wait!

190
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,207
Somebody at the festival is stealing things
from various clubs for no apparent reason!

191
00:09:57,482 --> 00:09:59,142
There! That's the story!

192
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:02,232
Jumonji!

193
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,530
That's who you mean!

194
00:10:03,617 --> 00:10:04,722
Do you know something?

195
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,461
Huh? Well... uh...

196
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,819
Right, alphabetical order. I see the pattern.

197
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,357
And you say the Fortunetelling Club got hit, too.

198
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:18,940
So that's why, then.

199
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:20,267
So that's why what?

200
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:23,482
Oh. We're the Kabe Newspaper Club.

201
00:10:23,686 --> 00:10:25,568
They got you too?

202
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,315
Jumonji took our <i>kata</i> knife.

203
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,526
I guess that explains why all of
you are running around like crazy.

204
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:31,312
Yeah.

205
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:34,815
I don't usually like being stolen from,
but at least we got a good story out of it.

206
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,769
I'm impressed. Your club figured out a lot.

207
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:40,367
It was mainly Oreki. You remember him.

208
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,665
Yeah. Sure.

209
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:46,296
Anyway, thanks for the tip. Appreciate it!

210
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,891
Please wait, Togaito!

211
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:55,704
I gave you some helpful information.

212
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,982
I hope you'll write about the Classic Lit Club now!

213
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,811
You will... right?

214
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,735
I kind of lost my cool toward the end there.

215
00:11:09,943 --> 00:11:12,887
I hope Togatio doesn't think I was doubting his integrity.

216
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,404
Excuse me!

217
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:16,844
Sorry!

218
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:19,928
Oh, it's you. Well? Did you have any luck?

219
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,334
Oh... well...

220
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:25,195
That's a good question.

221
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,452
Sorry, never mind. It's an inside joke.

222
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:29,493
Okay.

223
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,540
Well, anyway, I finally heard back from the Acapella Club.

224
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:34,373
Looks like it was apple juice that was taken.

225
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:36,794
Turns out the Wall Newspaper Club was targeted, too.

226
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,058
Apparently they had their cutter knife stolen.

227
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,665
Right. "Ka."

228
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,791
Japanese alphabetical order for sure.

229
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,495
Next up is the letter "ki," which
can only be the <i>Kijutsu,</i> or Magic Club.

230
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:49,190
Fortunately, it's almost time for the next performance,

231
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,690
and I think I'm gonna go.

232
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,107
You wanna catch Jumoji in the act?

233
00:11:53,374 --> 00:11:53,923
Yep.

234
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,784
That's a big weakness for this kind of thief.

235
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:59,659
He's bound by his own rules, so he's predictable.

236
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:03,473
We just have to anticipate Jumoji's
next move, and the thief will be unmasked.

237
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,523
But if we catch him at "ki," then it will all be over.

238
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:09,607
And the culprit will never have
made it to the Classic Lit Club.

239
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:10,632
That's all right.

240
00:12:10,926 --> 00:12:12,248
I'm sure we can figure something out.

241
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:14,245
Really? Like what, exactly?

242
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,440
Let's talk later, but now I need to get to the Magic Club.

243
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,440
Gotta catch a thief. See ya!

244
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:36,697
It's still only 2:00.

245
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:42,109
Ah, well, look who it is.

246
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,676
Hey. How's it going?

247
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:49,068
If you're standing around waiting for
the show to start, that means you must know.

248
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,100
Know what?

249
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,365
Don't play dumb with me!

250
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,614
You know about the phantom thief Jumoji.

251
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,077
Oh. That...

252
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:58,922
Good, then this will be our next competition.

253
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,565
You know about the Newspaper Club?

254
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,741
The cutter knife, you mean?

255
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:02,814
Sure, I heard about it.

256
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:06,254
Yeah. Obviously, they've taken
an interest in the crime spree.

257
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,540
Jumoji is the next issue's top story.

258
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:10,814
What's more, they're going to run an extra,

259
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,940
exclusively covering any group
that catches the phantom thief.

260
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:15,023
Yeah.

261
00:13:15,134 --> 00:13:18,370
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but I've got this one in the bag.

262
00:13:18,727 --> 00:13:20,546
Because you know who's a major mystery fan?

263
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:22,937
That's right! It's me!

264
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,489
Go easy on me, okay?

265
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,165
Ibara.

266
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,773
You're a Christie fan, right?

267
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:31,274
So you must have read <i>The ABC Murders</i> at some point.

268
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:32,982
Yeah, of course I have.

269
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:34,755
Then can you tell me something?

270
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:38,295
Was there a reason why the killings
were done in alphabetical order?

271
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:41,973
Spoiler alert! Are you sure?

272
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:42,848
Go ahead.

273
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,359
"He wanted to kill in alphabetical order,

274
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:47,757
so that's what he did."

275
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:50,205
Not exactly much of a motivation, is it?

276
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,086
No.

277
00:13:51,815 --> 00:13:54,233
Do you think the same thing is going on here?

278
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:55,661
I don't know.

279
00:13:56,028 --> 00:13:59,648
Anybody would have figured out the
pattern the thefts were following eventually.

280
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,209
Surely Jumoji would have realized that.

281
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:05,107
So why do it that way, then?

282
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:06,635
Right, that's what I'm wondering.

283
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:10,679
Is there some kind of hidden purpose or meaning
behind the way in which things are being stolen?

284
00:14:10,857 --> 00:14:14,358
Still, it is possible Jumoji's doing it just for fun.

285
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:16,987
Hmm... Interesting.

286
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:20,077
You really want to catch the thief now, don't you?

287
00:14:20,764 --> 00:14:22,802
You think so? Why's that?

288
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:24,464
You're pretty intent.

289
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,180
I don't care one way or another.

290
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:31,749
But once Chitanda says she's curious about
something, it becomes an issue that can't be avoided.

291
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:33,732
Why don't you just ignore her?

292
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:37,087
She's not someone I can easily
ignore, or trust me, I would.

293
00:14:40,527 --> 00:14:42,363
Right, I get it.

294
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:43,896
Okay, then.

295
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:44,906
You're leaving?

296
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,003
Yep.

297
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,808
Oh, and by the way, thank you for the flour.

298
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,273
It was a big help.

299
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,779
Oh! I almost forgot.

300
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,045
Really? You're charging me?

301
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,657
No, it's not like that.

302
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,518
It's the Warashibe Protocol.

303
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,623
I need you to give me something in return for the flour.

304
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,498
You do?

305
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:04,037
Like in the old folk tale.

306
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,748
The guy starts with a piece of
straw and trades till he gets rich.

307
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:08,082
Oh, yeah, okay.

308
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:09,220
Let's see...

309
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,168
You can have this.

310
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:14,690
Are you sure?

311
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,274
Yep.

312
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:20,308
Really? Can you cosplay without I... Ah!

313
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,913
Don't call it that, you idiot!

314
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:27,610
The show will be starting soon.

315
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:29,579
Please take your seats, everybody.

316
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:46,446
Irisu! Over here.

317
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,202
Oh. Hello.

318
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,585
I can't wait for the show. You?

319
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:55,266
I'm not sure how much I like magic, but here I am.

320
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,889
Yeah. It's something to do, right?

321
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,853
Could she be...?

322
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:04,364
That's crazy.

323
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,429
I mean, come on.

324
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:07,846
He didn't have to say it like that...

325
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:09,606
That's the Manga Club president.

326
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:11,546
I saw her at their booth yesterday.

327
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:13,388
Well, this should be fun.

328
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:15,739
Oh... Hey, look!

329
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,064
Tanabe just walked in.

330
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:21,303
And look at that!

331
00:16:21,392 --> 00:16:24,567
He's with the Student Council
President, Muneyoshi Kugayama.

332
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:26,617
Hey, Empress.

333
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,440
Hello.

334
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:28,102
Hi.

335
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:32,190
Hey, Fukube.

336
00:16:32,385 --> 00:16:32,845
Hi!

337
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:38,565
Thank you for your patience! The
Magic Club's performance will now begin.

338
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:42,373
We're glad to see so many friendly
faces in the audience this afternoon.

339
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:45,148
We hope you'll enjoy the show
that we've put together for you

340
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:48,012
and the tricks we've worked long and hard to master!

341
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:51,261
Now, then...

342
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,670
With this many people watching the show,

343
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:59,581
how will you commit your crime, phantom thief Jumoji?

344
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,152
Yoichi Takamura will perform "Living Dead."

345
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,317
What's wrong?

346
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:07,524
Well...

347
00:17:11,357 --> 00:17:12,085
Candle!

348
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,492
Sorry. Don't mind me.

349
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,312
Damn!

350
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:19,225
When...?

351
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,668
I was watching, and nobody but
the performers went near the stage.

352
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:27,924
Which means... it was taken before they started.

353
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:32,748
Ugh. Coming here was a waste of time!

354
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:36,412
What made me so sure he would steal
something during the performance, anyway?

355
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,930
I'm an idiot!

356
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:46,359
Thanks a lot! Have a good day!

357
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,519
We're selling more than yesterday, right?

358
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:49,896
Yeah, we are.

359
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,732
I guess the posters are helping.

360
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:52,738
That's great!

361
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:58,246
Obviously, we should have just done
what Kochi said from the very beginning.

362
00:17:58,456 --> 00:17:59,302
Yeah.

363
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:03,552
If a certain someone hadn't thrown a fit, I
bet we could have sold a bunch more yesterday.

364
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:04,648
Careful, now.

365
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,055
We don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, do we?

366
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,677
Try to ignore them.

367
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:09,463
Yeah.

368
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,570
And after all that, she couldn't find the thing?

369
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,880
A total lie, right?

370
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:18,713
I'm sure she just got scared that the manga she
was going on about was actually nothing special.

371
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:23,262
How pathetic! Bringing up some amateur
title just to make yourself look smart.

372
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,798
Yeah, totally!

373
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,148
How much you want to bet that manga doesn't even exist?

374
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:29,465
...Hey, hold on...

375
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:30,327
...Stop! That's enough.

376
00:18:30,988 --> 00:18:33,227
If you've never heard of it, you can keep quiet.

377
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,777
Hi, everyone.

378
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:37,739
I-I was just saying...

379
00:18:37,764 --> 00:18:39,129
Well now I'm saying.

380
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,841
If you don't know anything, you
should just keep your mouth shut.

381
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:47,831
So anyway...

382
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,290
How was the Magic Club show?

383
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,572
Good. I really enjoyed it.

384
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:52,788
Yeah?

385
00:18:53,002 --> 00:18:55,315
Maybe I could go and check it out tomorrow, then.

386
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:57,253
Okay. That should be fine.

387
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,753
What time does it start?

388
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,290
They do performances throughout the day,

389
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,190
so I'm sure you can make it to one of them.

390
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,324
Really? Thanks a lo...

391
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:07,128
Sorry. Think I can take a break?

392
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,637
Sure. No problem.

393
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:23,734
Hey!

394
00:19:28,565 --> 00:19:29,982
I really am pathetic.

395
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:32,313
I just want someone to tell me it'll be okay.

396
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:36,143
Ibara?

397
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:38,526
Uh... Yes!

398
00:19:38,764 --> 00:19:40,107
What's up, Yuasa?

399
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:41,322
I'm really sorry.

400
00:19:41,776 --> 00:19:43,548
Things have gotten pretty awkward, huh?

401
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:46,884
I don't know why you're apologizing.

402
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,695
For not saying anything sooner.

403
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:51,643
I should have taken your side before, and I didn't.

404
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:56,648
Except, if you had stood up for me yesterday, there
probably would've been friction between you and Kochi,

405
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,832
and I wouldn't want that to happen.

406
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,787
I think it's better this way.

407
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,232
It's all bluster.

408
00:20:02,361 --> 00:20:03,727
Ayako doesn't mean it.

409
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:05,268
Ayako?

410
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,695
Ayako Kochi. That's her full name.

411
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:09,694
Oh.

412
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,273
She seemed pretty serious, so what
makes you think she didn't mean it?

413
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,408
Because I know her. She and I are friends.

414
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:19,283
Is that it?

415
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,168
There's also the fact that she and Haruna were friends.

416
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,583
Sorry. Who's Haruna?

417
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,471
Haruna Anjo. Don't you know? She's one
of the authors of <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>.

418
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:34,458
It was a collaborative work?

419
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,737
Somebody else did the art for it.

420
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:39,209
Ayako would probably know who it was.

421
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,910
Can I talk to Haruna? What class is she in?

422
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:46,382
Well, she doesn't go here
anymore. She transferred schools.

423
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:48,877
Really? Too bad.

424
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,558
But even if they were good friends, what does that matter?

425
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:55,601
Friends don't agree on everything.

426
00:20:55,665 --> 00:20:57,912
Maybe this was something they disagreed about.

427
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,443
Yes, that's a good point, but sorry.

428
00:21:01,732 --> 00:21:04,633
I really shouldn't say any
more than I've already told you.

429
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,065
I mean... Ayako is my friend, after all.

430
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:11,839
And explaining why you think what
you do would mean speaking badly of her?

431
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:18,091
I think I need a little more time alone.

432
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:20,109
Are you sure?

433
00:21:20,372 --> 00:21:23,455
It's okay. I won't be much longer.

434
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:31,315
Extra! Extra!

435
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:33,136
It's a must-read, kids!

436
00:21:57,788 --> 00:21:59,288
He did come through!

437
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,489
Bad news. I've been had!

438
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:08,192
There was a candle stolen from the Magic Club earlier.

439
00:22:08,398 --> 00:22:10,456
They even found the standard confession note.

440
00:22:10,874 --> 00:22:12,331
Isn't that good news, though?

441
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:15,661
We don't want the thief caught before
he hits the Classic Lit Club, right?

442
00:22:15,873 --> 00:22:18,345
Yeah. I know that's what we decided.

443
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,355
But I thought maybe I could catch him red-handed.

444
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:23,905
You hoped the theft would happen during the performance?

445
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:24,724
Yeah.

446
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:28,118
Jumoji doesn't really seem to
want an audience for the thefts.

447
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,430
I mean, the Cooking Club's ladle
disappeared before the contest, right?

448
00:22:33,248 --> 00:22:35,299
If you realized that, then why not say something?

449
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:39,097
It's not like you told me you were going
to the Magic Club to catch him in the act.

450
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:42,942
Yeah. I guess that's true.

451
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,032
Hey, guys, I'm back!

452
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:50,521
And I'm happy to report that the 20 volumes of
<i>Hyouka</i> we left with Irisu are selling at a good pace!

453
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,582
Irisu could sell a glass of water to a drowning man.

454
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,293
There's one other thing, too.

455
00:22:55,498 --> 00:23:00,430
In their 4:00 edition, the Wall Newspaper Club
has included an article that covers the Jumoji case.

456
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:03,687
It also mentions the alphabetical
order pattern of the crimes.

457
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,417
Cool.

458
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:06,961
The best part is that we're in the story, too.

459
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,744
It says that the final item will be taken from
either the Industrial Arts Club or the Classic Lit Club.

460
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:14,190
An IA club? We have one of those?

461
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:16,240
Yeah, we do. Guess I forgot.

462
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,045
If they get hit, then our
whole plan goes up in smoke, huh?

463
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,794
I'm thinking about making a deal
with the Broadcasting Club tomorrow.

464
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,520
If we can get them to give us some
airtime, that would be great publicity.

465
00:23:28,094 --> 00:23:29,624
What? Is something wrong?

466
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,779
Well... It's just...

467
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:32,574
You look... tired.

468
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,592
Man, am I tired.

469
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,355
Oh. Mayaka.

470
00:23:35,482 --> 00:23:37,444
So how were our sales today?

471
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:41,290
Not counting the ones we gave
Irisu, we managed to sell 16.

472
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:42,760
Not that bad.

473
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:45,984
I guess so. Yeah.

474
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:47,716
It could be worse.

475
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:04,020
As president, it's my job to go around
recruiting people to help us sell the anthology.

476
00:24:06,857 --> 00:24:09,598
But honestly... I'm getting worn out.

477
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:16,334
<i>Body Talk</i>.

478
00:24:17,357 --> 00:24:21,102
There's no denying it's a step below <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>.

479
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,058
But still, it's pretty good.

480
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:36,602
Ugh. My stuff is a hundred steps below.

481
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,993
Hotaro's changed.

482
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:42,711
No, more like he's finally showing his true potential.

483
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,008
And it's all because he met Chitanda.

484
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:49,553
She's brought an element of unpredictability
into his life that's forcing him to grow.

485
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,602
I should be happy for him.

486
00:24:52,143 --> 00:24:53,915
And I am, really.

487
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,838
It's just sometimes I wish...

488
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,722
There are over a thousand suspects.

489
00:25:00,184 --> 00:25:04,560
There's no way that simple deduction is going
to be able to whittle down a list that long.

490
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:07,977
Which means that our best shot at solving this mystery

491
00:25:08,064 --> 00:25:09,900
is catching the thief in the act.

492
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:13,189
I don't know if Hotaro will be able to solve this one,

493
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:15,747
but I think I can.

494
00:25:16,318 --> 00:25:21,189
Hotaro. I'm going to catch Jumoji, just you watch.

495
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:28,493
They do mail order too?

496
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,972
Next time:

497
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,440
"The Final Target."
