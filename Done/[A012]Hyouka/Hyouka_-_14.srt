1
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:07,264
I'm sorry. I don't have it for you.

2
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,758
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i>?

3
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:11,513
You couldn't find it or something?

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:17,060
I must have brought it with me when
I went to the country on vacation.

5
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:23,498
Is that the truth?

6
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:24,641
Yes.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,108
Fine.

8
00:00:28,463 --> 00:00:29,961
Why don't you help with the posters, then?

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:34,210
The posters? Sure. Which ones?

10
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,704
Well... Start with <i>moe</i>.

11
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:37,696
I have to step out for a little bit.

12
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:49,964
I'm impressed. She remembered the title.

13
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,754
So Chitanda, Mayaka...

14
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:26,028
Don't forget that the cooking
contest starts at 11:30, okay?

15
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:27,299
Right!

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,179
I'm sorry, Fuku, but I promised that I
would help draw posters for the Manga Club.

17
00:02:33,426 --> 00:02:35,118
What? Oh, bummer.

18
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,620
Well, let me see here.

19
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:41,330
If we move things around and
put you in the last position...

20
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:44,753
As long as you get there by 12:10, we should be fine.

21
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:46,224
That sounds great!

22
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,909
I'll do my best to make it by then.

23
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:48,640
See ya!

24
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:55,917
Well, I need to pop by the executive committee
room, so I'll see you guys around in a little while.

25
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,842
He's enjoying this way too much.

26
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:03,440
Hey!

27
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:07,144
Sorry, but would you mind
taking that box to the gym for me?

28
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:08,740
Sure, no problem.

29
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,265
By the way...

30
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:12,712
Have you had a chance to look around the festival at all?

31
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,740
Not really. I keep having to put out little fires,

32
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,725
but I have been able to do some exploring.

33
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,118
Why? Have you picked up any
interesting stories along the way?

34
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:23,549
Oh, man, all kinds of stuff has gone down.

35
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:24,891
Ah!

36
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,641
I heard a thief struck over at the Go Club.

37
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:29,007
What?

38
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:33,235
They stole some of the Go stones and
left a mysterious confession note behind.

39
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,872
Wow. I see.

40
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,323
You said the Go Club?

41
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,168
Yeah, but if you ask me,

42
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:40,407
I think one of their own members is to blame.

43
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:41,471
No.

44
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,863
There was another theft, according to Okano.

45
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:45,632
Apparently something with the Acapella Club.

46
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,623
Yeah? What got stolen there?

47
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:51,404
He said someone took a drink from their
cooler... some kind of juice, I think.

48
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,675
Did the thief leave a confession note?

49
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:56,711
Yeah, they mentioned finding a weird message in there.

50
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,615
Things just took an interesting turn.

51
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,296
What's up now, Fukube?

52
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,218
Why are you smiling?

53
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,100
Oh, nothing, don't worry about it.

54
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:09,017
Today's the day!

55
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,723
I've got this!

56
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,916
That's fine. I'll help you.

57
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:20,240
You're saying that I can leave them here?

58
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,156
Yeah.

59
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,222
Oh... Wow!

60
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,399
I appreciate it more than you know!

61
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,410
Better not say that until they're all sold.

62
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:31,150
So... How many, and what's the price?

63
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:36,482
We're selling at 200 each, and we printed... 200 copies.

64
00:04:38,532 --> 00:04:39,722
That's a lot.

65
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:45,323
We meant to get 30, but we made a mistake, so we
need to sell as many as possible to pay for them.

66
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,486
We're desperate. We need help.

67
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:53,499
Why don't we lower the price of <i>Hyouka</i> to 150?

68
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:56,423
I'll sell them with the pamphlets for 200 total.

69
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:00,075
Great.

70
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:03,948
What's in the gym?

71
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:06,171
I don't know, probably something dumb.

72
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:10,532
What are you doing? I want a copy of <i>Hyouka</i>.

73
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:13,965
Oh, right. I was confused by your hand.

74
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,133
I'm sorry, but I didn't bring one.

75
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:19,415
From now on, you should carry a copy with you.

76
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:21,751
Your presentation is important as well.

77
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:27,574
Irisu...

78
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,480
Uh... What is it?

79
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:32,142
You're an expert at getting what
you want when you need a favor, right?

80
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:32,754
Uh...

81
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:35,757
Would you be willing to share
the secrets of your success with me?

82
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:36,481
What?!

83
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:38,333
What the...?

84
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:47,881
Yeah, okay.

85
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:53,119
First of all, no matter what it is that you're
asking for, you have to make the other person think

86
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,619
that it's their idea.

87
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:56,724
Their idea?

88
00:05:57,218 --> 00:06:01,802
To do that, you have to set up an environment in
which they feel emotional contentment and trust.

89
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,365
There's a myriad of ways to achieve this,
but your most effective style would be...

90
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:06,608
...expectation.

91
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:08,101
Oh, yeah?

92
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:09,105
Yes.

93
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,488
Make the other person think you expect
this of them, and they'll feel obligated.

94
00:06:13,043 --> 00:06:14,170
Obligated...

95
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:18,270
If you can do that much, their conscience
will do the rest and they'll commit to it.

96
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:19,865
They'll commit to it?

97
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:24,102
Yes, but you have to make the favor seem
like less of an ordeal than it actually is.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,573
Like less of an ordeal?

99
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:31,838
Like it's not that big of a thing to you, but that
it will pay them major dividends if they agree to it.

100
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,477
One other tip, and it's a big one.

101
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,924
If possible, ask someone of the
opposite sex, and do it out of public view.

102
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,649
Right.

103
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,594
Now hurry along.

104
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:49,231
Get those anthologies.

105
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:51,470
Yes, right away.

106
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,794
Thank you. That helps a lot.

107
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:21,288
Trick or treat!

108
00:07:21,313 --> 00:07:22,823
Yay!

109
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:29,749
Trick or treat!

110
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:30,990
Yay!

111
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,088
What are you two supposed to be?

112
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:38,703
We're selling treats door to door for the Confection Club!

113
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:40,776
Would you like to buy some cookies?

114
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,921
Sure, how much?

115
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,283
They're on sale at 100 yen per bag!

116
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:47,032
Wow, you're packing heat!

117
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,564
How cool!

118
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:49,298
Ooh!

119
00:07:49,323 --> 00:07:51,383
We could pretend to be robbers...

120
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:54,927
If you really want it, I'm willing to
trade you two cookie bags for that pistol.

121
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,509
Act now and I'll throw in an anthology for free.

122
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,385
Huh? Are you being serious?

123
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,236
Kerblam!

124
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:02,348
Okay!

125
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,096
Here ya go.

126
00:08:04,715 --> 00:08:08,321
And as a symbol of our pumpkin-head
gratitude, have this, too!

127
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:10,757
You're selling flour?

128
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,010
Yay!

129
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,240
Trick or treat!

130
00:08:15,383 --> 00:08:16,863
Kerblam!

131
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,627
The Manga Club's vaunted artist, huh?

132
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:36,145
Isn't that nice.

133
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:43,725
There. All done.

134
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:47,801
Mayaka!

135
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,639
All right, let's do this!

136
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:05,541
Is Mayaka coming?

137
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,195
She's still busy with the Manga Club stuff.

138
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,364
Oh, all right.

139
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,556
But let's not give up hope just yet.

140
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,796
Hey, Fukube!

141
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,726
This here is Suhara.

142
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,746
His dad's a professional chef.

143
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,946
Oh, yeah? That's pretty awesome.

144
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:23,107
Well... Do your best and I'm sure you'll be fine.

145
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:23,997
Bye!

146
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:28,083
We will do our best...

147
00:09:32,143 --> 00:09:35,155
All right, everyone, time to meet our contestants!

148
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:39,324
Number one. Team Ajiyoshi!

149
00:09:40,573 --> 00:09:47,356
Number two. Team... Fata... Morgana!

150
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,075
Number three!

151
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:53,156
Team... Astronomy Club!

152
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:56,318
Team number four!

153
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:59,457
Team Classic Lit Club!

154
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,923
All right! Yeah!

155
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,998
Here are the rules, so listen carefully.

156
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,055
Each team member has 20 minutes
to cook their individual dish.

157
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,827
After that 20 minutes is up, they
must pass the baton to the next person.

158
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:15,245
Team members outside of the cooking area are
not allowed to talk to the member who is cooking,

159
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,740
so keep that in mind and follow the rules!

160
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:20,630
Fukube, do you know what dish you're going to cook?

161
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:22,837
I'm really delighted you asked!

162
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,088
My special: Fuku hoisin fried rice.

163
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:30,282
That's great! Although, by the rules, we
would have to boil the rice from scratch.

164
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:33,843
So that means you'd have to be
our anchorman and finish us out.

165
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:38,004
No, I don't think my plan is going to work after all.

166
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:43,146
Since I can't make my rice, I'll lead us off
and get the ball rolling with some other dish.

167
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,062
Whatever you make will be great.

168
00:10:45,156 --> 00:10:45,656
Now!

169
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:48,328
Each team member must prepare at least one dish.

170
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,609
Ingredients are first-come,
first-serve, in bowls in the center.

171
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,453
Once they're gone, don't worry.

172
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:56,297
You are allowed to procure others,
but only from on school grounds.

173
00:10:56,426 --> 00:10:58,935
All that said, get ready for the first round!

174
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,841
To your kitchens!

175
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:03,914
Here goes!

176
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,573
Without further ado, let's begin!

177
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,823
It's Wild...

178
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,823
...Fire!

179
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,956
Fire.

180
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:34,875
Okay, everybody, Wild Fire is underway.

181
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:39,577
I don't know about you, Prez, but I'm certainly
looking forward to what each team will present to us.

182
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,507
Let's hope it's good!

183
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:48,823
Oh, Team Classic Lit Club is pulling the heads
off dried fish and cleaning each one individually!

184
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,083
That looks like some pretty precise work.

185
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:52,783
What do you have to say, Prez?

186
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:55,963
This is the kind of prep work that sets a team apart, VP.

187
00:11:56,034 --> 00:11:59,180
Team Fata Morgana is doing great things with clam meat!

188
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:01,690
Is he going to make daikon radish miso soup?

189
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,774
Huh?! Fukube! You shouldn't be doing that!

190
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,388
You're supposed to peel the daikon first!

191
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:09,411
Fu...

192
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh, no!

193
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,139
I forgot I'm not supposed to talk to him!

194
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,617
I've gotta follow the rules!

195
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,213
The daikon...

196
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:19,239
Peel it! Peel it!

197
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,090
Come on, Fukube!

198
00:12:23,395 --> 00:12:24,323
Ah!

199
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,407
Did he figure out what he's doing wrong?

200
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,573
What?!

201
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:29,918
Is he peeling each radish wheel separately?

202
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,965
The water! The water's boiling over!

203
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,044
That looks like it's gonna take
quite some time, Team Classic Lit Club!

204
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,877
Don't get stuck in a loop, kid!

205
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:43,392
That's that.

206
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:44,910
What next?

207
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:48,407
We're still not able to tell at
this point what each team is making.

208
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,698
Uh-oh, Team Classic Lit is tilting his head!

209
00:12:50,782 --> 00:12:52,149
What does that mean?

210
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,546
Ow! Hot!

211
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,044
Ah, I think I get it now!

212
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:00,562
He's making miso meat stew!

213
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,673
Looks like Team Ajiyoshi is preparing a basic meat sauce!

214
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,115
That sounds tasty!

215
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,513
There's no way I'll make it at this pace!

216
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:10,690
All right, lead cooks! Your time is almost up!

217
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:15,658
Five! Four! Three!

218
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,437
Two! One!

219
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:19,032
Time to switch!

220
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,073
Sorry.

221
00:13:20,157 --> 00:13:22,067
I was only able to prepare one dish.

222
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,465
That's okay. You just leave this round to me!

223
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,603
For sure! Get 'em, Chitanda.

224
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:27,740
That's amazing!

225
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,927
Team Classic Lit Club is paring that
daikon like she's been to culinary school!

226
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:33,096
You're absolutely correct.

227
00:13:33,168 --> 00:13:34,892
That is professional level work.

228
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:35,837
I'm impressed.

229
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,407
She could skim the skin off a pudding,
judging by the way she's peeling that thing.

230
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,490
That's amazing.

231
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,821
She's already completed one dish.

232
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:49,827
Well, that's Chitanda for you.

233
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:53,205
Team Classic Lit Club is hand-washing her rice!

234
00:13:53,308 --> 00:13:56,723
They've already gone through all six liters
of water that they were allotted at the start!

235
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:58,272
That's an admirable way to do it.

236
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,172
The flavor of the rice is crucial.

237
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,078
Whoa!

238
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,192
Take a look at Team Astronomy Club!

239
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,272
What's going on?

240
00:14:04,526 --> 00:14:06,555
If that's not a flambé, they should be worried!

241
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,477
Get the fire extinguisher ready!

242
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:11,766
Meanwhile... is Team Classic Lit Club making <i>giseyaki</i> ?

243
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,435
I sure love down home cooking!

244
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:15,198
Like mom used to make!

245
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,684
I've never even heard of <i>giseyaki</i>!

246
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,323
And, over at Team Fata Morgana,

247
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:24,148
the yellowtail teriyaki is nearing completion!

248
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,032
Brilliant!

249
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:29,489
Team Classic Lit Club is plating up that <i>giseyaki</i>!

250
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,257
I'm starting to get really hungry!

251
00:14:31,282 --> 00:14:34,157
Just who is that second cook of theirs, anyway?

252
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:37,448
She's Miss Eru Chitanda, of the famous farming Chitandas,

253
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:39,197
and don't you forget it!

254
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:43,758
Meanwhile, Team Astronomy Club still seems
to be using an avant-garde cooking style!

255
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,650
Looks pretty far out there!

256
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:51,172
Team Classic Lit Club is rolling boiled
potatoes in starch and putting them in ceramic ware.

257
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,913
Now she's making <i>imochi</i> cakes?

258
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,225
This girl definitely knows what she's doing!

259
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,823
Oh... That's trouble!

260
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,395
This is making me nervous.

261
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,563
Trouble? What trouble?

262
00:15:02,716 --> 00:15:05,932
No outside help is allowed, Team Classic Lit Club!

263
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:16,316
It's no use. I'm not getting through.

264
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,713
All right, teams, your 40 minutes are up.

265
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:24,722
Time to switch to your anchormen.

266
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey, Fukube.

267
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,240
How'd I do?

268
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,198
You were amazing, Chitanda.

269
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,453
I had no idea you had such advanced culinary skills.

270
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,908
Cooking's fun! It's one of my hobbies.

271
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,639
Yeah, well done out there.

272
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:38,760
Although...

273
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:40,325
What's wrong?

274
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,257
We're already out of ingredients!

275
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,532
Mayaka. I'm sorry.

276
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:59,876
Okay, the time has come for
the anchormen to bring it home!

277
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,126
Finished!

278
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,794
'Scuse me!

279
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:09,483
Pardon me! Coming through!

280
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,024
Very nice!

281
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:20,823
It looks like Team Ajiyoshi is preparing
apples for a dessert course! Adorable!

282
00:16:20,907 --> 00:16:24,157
Those little bunnies are taking
shape right before our eyes!

283
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:29,282
As of right now, Team Classic Lit
Club's anchorman has yet to appear!

284
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,323
Oh, my! Team Ajiyoshi is making celery roses!

285
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,318
Impressive!

286
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:36,162
That dessert is going to be a spectacle for sure!

287
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:39,572
Leaving Team Classic Lit Club and
their missing anchorman in the dust,

288
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,028
Team Ajiyoshi is making real progress
with their elaborate dessert scenery!

289
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,413
Mayaka!

290
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,019
What's this?

291
00:16:57,052 --> 00:17:00,148
A girl in civilian clothes has just burst onto the scene!

292
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:03,033
Is she the missing member of Team Classic Lit Club?

293
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,376
That must be the case!

294
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,736
It's their anchorman!

295
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:09,761
She's finally arrived! Get cooking, girl!

296
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,665
Uh-oh!

297
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:26,323
Team Classic Lit Club is out of
the frying pan and into the fire!

298
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:29,361
There are no ingredients left to work with!

299
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:36,615
If she's unable to cook anything, then the
anchorman's score will be a big, fat zero!

300
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,683
After a hard-fought battle, could this
blow mean the end for the Classic Lit Club?

301
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,548
Is this really it?

302
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:50,290
Team Classic Lit Club seems to have found
a small onion. But is that cause for hope?

303
00:17:50,365 --> 00:17:53,101
What dish could she make with that measly little onion?

304
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:56,273
She's just standing there. Could she be stumped after all?

305
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,641
What will you do, Team Classic Lit Club?

306
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,803
If you don't cook anything, your team will lose for sure!

307
00:18:01,905 --> 00:18:03,442
What can they do?

308
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:06,869
What can I make?

309
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,513
I'm nervous.

310
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:11,914
What in the world could she
prepare with only those ingredients?

311
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,243
Now I'm curious. I have to know!

312
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,331
It's kind of your fault!

313
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:20,709
Team Classic Lit Club's anchorman
has still not moved a muscle!

314
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:25,637
And there it is, folks!

315
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:30,236
Team Fata Morgana has prepared a
fabulous omelet! Looks delicious!

316
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,198
Think, Mayaka!

317
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:35,698
You've got to think!

318
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:39,316
Has Team Classic Lit Club
finally reached the end of the line?

319
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:41,323
Come on.

320
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,225
There has to be something!

321
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:47,865
Team Classic Lit Club seems to
be out of options! What to do?

322
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,485
The time is running out!

323
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,567
Ten minutes!

324
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,032
That's not much!

325
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,794
Are they going to admit defeat and let the time run out?

326
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:56,525
Satoshi!

327
00:18:58,383 --> 00:18:58,956
Listen.

328
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,791
Did you hear someone calling your name just now, Fukube?

329
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:02,305
What?

330
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:02,880
Satoshi!

331
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,058
Team Astronomy is boiling bananas in vegetable stock?

332
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,592
Excuse me, sir!

333
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:10,389
What is it?

334
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:12,248
Be quiet for a moment!

335
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,748
Satoshi!

336
00:19:16,835 --> 00:19:18,174
Sounds like Oreki!

337
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:20,757
Look! He's up there!

338
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:22,003
In the clubroom!

339
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:24,975
Satoshi!

340
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,580
What the...?

341
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,923
Who is that?

342
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,651
Satoshi!

343
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:37,457
Get over here! Under the window!

344
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:38,886
Hurry up!

345
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,007
Go, Fukube!

346
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:40,951
Right.

347
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,392
What do you want?

348
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,283
Get ready to catch this!

349
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,367
Nice catch, huh?

350
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:06,852
So... What's this, then?

351
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,590
Team Classic Lit Club's lead
chef has reappeared on the scene!

352
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:14,218
What...?

353
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:18,891
Interesting!

354
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,356
He seems to have thrown her a bag of flour!

355
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:23,090
What a dramatic turn of events!

356
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:24,673
Checking the rule book...

357
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:26,477
Okay! It will be allowed!

358
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:27,399
All right!

359
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,290
Only seven minutes remain on the clock!

360
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:33,294
As each Wild Fire team enters
the final phase of competition,

361
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,378
Team Classic Lit Club has finally sprung back into action!

362
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,418
Under such impossible circumstances,

363
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:40,763
what kind of heroics will they need to save their dish?

364
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,198
We're all waiting with bated breath!

365
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,548
I know I'm curious!

366
00:20:43,573 --> 00:20:44,458
What's this?

367
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:46,157
She's busted out the shrimp heads?

368
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,715
What could she possibly have up her sleeve?

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>Kakiage</i>.

370
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:52,869
She's making...

371
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,175
...<i>kakiage</i> tempura!

372
00:20:57,526 --> 00:21:00,839
Only five minutes left on the
clock in the Wild Fire competition!

373
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,404
How will it end?

374
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:06,138
Uh... Hey, you! Cooking Club!

375
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,632
You could at least provide me with a ladle!

376
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:19,614
The Classic Lit Club gets their
ladle and moves on to the next step!

377
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:23,985
The pressure is on for Team Classic Lit Club.

378
00:21:24,088 --> 00:21:27,068
Can they hustle enough to rally
from behind and beat the clock?

379
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:28,862
It's <i>kakiage</i> over rice!

380
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,635
Will Team Classic Lit be able to pull this off?

381
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
There's only one minute left!

382
00:21:36,782 --> 00:21:39,284
That doesn't leave her very much time to finish!

383
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,208
She scoops it up!

384
00:21:56,573 --> 00:21:59,345
She lays it ever so gently in the bowl.

385
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,407
Three! Two! One!

386
00:22:03,432 --> 00:22:05,995
It's over!

387
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:18,937
Oh, yeah!

388
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,241
Go, Mayaka!

389
00:22:21,985 --> 00:22:23,051
Great job!

390
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,647
Yeah!

391
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:48,909
What's the matter?

392
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:51,611
Oh, nothing; don't worry about it.

393
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,504
And now, it's time to announce the results!

394
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:05,032
The hard-earned victory goes to...

395
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,805
...Team Classic Lit Club!

396
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,103
I'm exhausted.

397
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,098
It was undercooked.

398
00:23:15,273 --> 00:23:18,411
Hey, with all the obstacles you faced, that was fantastic.

399
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:22,782
Yeah, but I had to wait for that ladle!

400
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:25,948
If I would have had one, it
would have turned out perfectly!

401
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:28,215
It took a whole minute for them to get one!

402
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:29,185
Idiot.

403
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,432
I should have known not to start
cooking that dish without a stupid ladle!

404
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,316
Hey, I'm really sorry about that!

405
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,335
I thought we had checked all
of the supplies very carefully.

406
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:40,004
We should have made another pass before we started.

407
00:23:40,743 --> 00:23:43,429
Yeah, I thought that was weird,
and I should've said something...

408
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:45,416
Just slipped my mind, I guess.

409
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,473
That's okay; things were crazy!

410
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:48,815
Let's see...

411
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:53,368
No way!

412
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:55,512
What is it?

413
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:57,490
A confession note!

414
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:37,253
Next time:

415
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,308
"The Jumonji Affair."
