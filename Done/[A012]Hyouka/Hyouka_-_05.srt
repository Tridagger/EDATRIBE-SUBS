1
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,262
Oh.

2
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:42,725
Yep.

3
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:49,959
Yes.

4
00:11:57,626 --> 00:11:58,367
Yes.

5
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:23,314
Yes.

6
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:42,256
Yes.

7
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:50,240
How?

8
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:31,988
Yeah.

9
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:52,892
Sure.

10
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:09,768
Yeah!

11
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:27,420
Okay.

12
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:11,903
Hey...

13
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,170
Great!

14
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:08,534
Right.

15
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:04,870
Well...

16
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,249
Really?

17
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:43,825
Well...

18
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,319
Not yet.

19
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:13,442
Hold on.

20
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:56,802
Hotaro...

21
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,202
Hey! Wait!

22
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,200
Seriously?

23
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:12,602
Just luck.

24
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,238
Next time:

25
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,040
Maybe I am.

26
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:33,948
Well, um...

27
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,173
I have one.

28
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:54,925
Uh, Hotaro?

29
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,354
This is it.

30
00:22:04,387 --> 00:22:05,299
He told me.

31
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:38,445
Absolutely!

32
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:44,254
Wait a sec.

33
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:33,387
About what?

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,201
Yeah, maybe.

35
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:27,077
Just listen.

36
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:18,878
Yeah, right.

37
00:03:56,977 --> 00:03:58,217
I don't know.

38
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,079
I don't know.

39
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:15,116
I don't know.

40
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,190
Jun Sekitani?

41
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,121
I don't know.

42
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,220
There you go.

43
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:32,520
Where is she?

44
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:54,098
That's right.

45
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,462
I don't know.

46
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:15,754
Yeah, me too.

47
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:55,925
That's right.

48
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:58,881
I don't know.

49
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,104
Yeah, well...

50
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:51,905
What's wrong?

51
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:36,472
Yeah, so am I.

52
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,587
He was a hero.

53
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh, hey, Fuku.

54
00:09:24,312 --> 00:09:25,304
Yoko Koriyama.

55
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:28,445
At that point,

56
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:48,847
And the title?

57
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,629
It's wordplay?

58
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,350
Oh. Uh, is it?

59
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,005
The thing is...

60
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:14,179
Oh, yeah? Good!

61
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,682
It's all right.

62
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,255
You don't know?

63
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:43,546
Seriously what?

64
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,276
Of course I do.

65
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:52,452
What, with her?

66
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:55,170
Come on, Oreki,

67
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:30,920
Not the future.

68
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,224
Which is why...

69
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,241
How'd I do that?

70
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,396
Oh, hey you two.

71
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,124
You all made it.

72
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:25,139
Okay, so then...

73
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,170
A long time ago.

74
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:42,516
Well, you see...

75
00:20:50,698 --> 00:20:51,882
Come on, Hotaro.

76
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:03,379
Ice cream? Okay.

77
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:02,139
Of course it is.

78
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,570
"Hey there, sis.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,931
Hotaro? That you?

80
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:43,443
Thank you, Ibara.

81
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,882
Very interesting.

82
00:14:58,595 --> 00:14:59,780
Quite impressive.

83
00:20:10,322 --> 00:20:11,451
I'm sorry, but...

84
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:09,415
It was just luck.

85
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:49,258
No, that's silly.

86
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,125
Have a nice trip.

87
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:33,383
It's for Chitanda.

88
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:02,928
Couldn't tell you.

89
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,266
It seems wasteful.

90
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,915
A sunny life. Huh.

91
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,200
No way! Seriously?

92
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,308
Hi, Miss Itoigawa!

93
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,318
Am I way off base?

94
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:10,623
I was wondering...

95
00:25:35,563 --> 00:25:36,817
I'm babbling, huh?

96
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:45,989
I'll give it a try.

97
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,594
So not cool, Tomoe!

98
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,158
Wait, "the source"?

99
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:46,963
It's our librarian.

100
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:50,617
Yeah. Well, see ya.

101
00:00:10,592 --> 00:00:11,633
That's pretty major.

102
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:23,735
Yeah. To you, maybe.

103
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:55,125
Well, say something!

104
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,716
By gaps I mean gaps.

105
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,077
Unless I'm mistaken,

106
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,728
Yes. I remember now.

107
00:23:09,774 --> 00:23:11,649
Okay. If you say so.

108
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:17,734
Ice cream. I scream.

109
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,167
It only makes sense.

110
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:52,295
So, Oreki. What's up?

111
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:45,851
I still don't get it.

112
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,141
No, don't do it, Chi!

113
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:00,532
It's hard to explain.

114
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,217
So I thought, why not?

115
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:26,788
Sorry, what'd you say?

116
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,853
The dog is the school.

117
00:20:04,658 --> 00:20:05,872
so how could we argue?

118
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,980
You really don't know?

119
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:29,675
It's got me wondering.

120
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,223
Your brother, Hotaro."

121
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,187
Hello, Oreki residence.

122
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:54,801
Don't underestimate me!

123
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:56,848
She felt sorry for him.

124
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,138
Here's the man himself.

125
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:53,090
Because Jun Sekitani...

126
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:09,671
I'm sorry to hear that.

127
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,554
a little bit at a time.

128
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,568
So is that really true?

129
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:23,129
I would be eaten alive.

130
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,574
That's always possible.

131
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,084
We're missing something.

132
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:37,286
So... No sign of Hotaro?

133
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,268
That's when it happened.

134
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:07,168
And then he also said...

135
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,513
This whole Hyouka thing.

136
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:31,414
Am I doing things right?

137
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:50,691
What? Are you kidding me?

138
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,464
You looked for her, then?

139
00:09:35,307 --> 00:09:36,889
Right, library assistant?

140
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,947
Why, yes, I did write it.

141
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,210
A crazy curiosity monkey?

142
00:24:10,695 --> 00:24:11,735
Yeah. That sounds grea...

143
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,320
I dunno. Maybe it's both.

144
00:00:35,527 --> 00:00:37,154
It's her fault, all right.

145
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,757
I've still got work to do.

146
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,506
No problem. I'll help you.

147
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:39,729
I'm sorry, Oreki's theory?

148
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:20,587
Well, I'm truly astounded.

149
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:48,385
Did he make a brave stand,

150
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,331
How is that even possible?

151
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,531
Yeah, out with it already!

152
00:26:57,395 --> 00:26:58,952
And thanks for the advice.

153
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:15,910
You surprised me, you know.

154
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,141
How are things on your end?

155
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:05,553
I've gotta figure this out.

156
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,287
What do you mean by "gaps"?

157
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:48,877
That's who you mean, right?

158
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,504
Hi there, Classic Lit Club.

159
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:03,123
How is he doing these days?

160
00:17:52,477 --> 00:17:54,106
The rest of us did nothing.

161
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,543
But, despite our cowardice,

162
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:20,737
Nobody ever figured it out?

163
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:21,826
Hey. You guys... I don't...

164
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:21,420
If that day came... Then...

165
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,666
It's an incredible outline!

166
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:06,425
If what you suspect is true,

167
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,238
It's a little late for th...

168
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,795
Oh, really, your uncle, huh?

169
00:13:39,925 --> 00:13:41,546
What exactly does that mean?

170
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,158
rather than the normal five.

171
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,206
"Committing a Cardinal Sin."

172
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,839
Well, let's get on with this.

173
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,575
Just admit it. You're pumped!

174
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,162
You see ma'am, he's my uncle.

175
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:55,752
The whole school was on edge.

176
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,748
The rabbits are the students.

177
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,514
Now... I can let my uncle go.

178
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,170
That's just my way of living.

179
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,206
And I don't like that feeling.

180
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,643
That's who you mean, isn't it?

181
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:48,305
Nothing right now. I gotta go!

182
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,229
What did you wanna talk about?

183
00:09:43,571 --> 00:09:45,231
Would you please just tell us?

184
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:27,228
But the year I started school,

185
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:51,586
When this whole thing started,

186
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,330
Is "Kanyasai" still off-limits?

187
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:47,270
Look at this. What does it say?

188
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,649
The sacrifices that were made."

189
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,740
Why they chose the name <i>Hyouka</i>.

190
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,172
Well, whatever the case may be,

191
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:33,434
Rather than involve the police,

192
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:23,210
Yeah, I didn't expect it either.

193
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:04,319
Nothing in particular to report.

194
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,670
Well... I'm not so sure anymore.

195
00:12:40,235 --> 00:12:42,206
Sorry. I meant curiosity junkie.

196
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,970
It was a very long time ago now,

197
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,292
And in the end, we went too far.

198
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:22,716
The origin of the term Kanyasai.

199
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:10,925
He said that I had to be strong.

200
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:43,603
And that's why I started to cry.

201
00:22:50,754 --> 00:22:54,050
I remember. Finally, I remember!

202
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:32,479
You know, I'm kind of surprised.

203
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:49,505
Y'know... You surprised me, too.

204
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:35,466
Sure. Honestly, it was kinda fun.

205
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:48,901
"The struggles that were endured.

206
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,739
Does it really mean "sacrifices"?

207
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:10,283
Wow, you are freaky good at this.

208
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:06,390
Yes, that's my conjecture anyway.

209
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:02,218
You see right through things, eh?

210
00:18:01,765 --> 00:18:04,253
Sekitani never broke his silence.

211
00:18:26,578 --> 00:18:28,423
Now it only lasts for three days.

212
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:04,967
You know, I've noticed something.

213
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:07,545
I know it's a big responsibility.

214
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,155
Just get to work on your outline.

215
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm surprised she isn't exhausted.

216
00:01:16,704 --> 00:01:18,666
Same thing goes for you and Ibara.

217
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:37,505
I mean... All I wanna do is relax.

218
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,703
Chitanda's search for the truth...

219
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,126
Am I cut out for that kinda thing?

220
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,965
Hey, sis, you're still alive, huh?

221
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,324
I just reached Pristina yesterday.

222
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:19,879
There's a name that takes me back!

223
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,552
What a tragedy, huh? The poor kid.

224
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,463
It's the whole Jun Sekitani thing.

225
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:18,997
Not true. We can go to the source.

226
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,004
The person who wrote the foreword.

227
00:10:58,372 --> 00:10:59,723
Actually, it's almost time for it.

228
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,621
Jun Sekitani drew the short straw.

229
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,010
But he never made his name public.

230
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,647
I mean... The message was obvious.

231
00:21:05,547 --> 00:21:07,612
Like I said before, it's wordplay.

232
00:22:57,635 --> 00:22:59,680
And it's all thanks to you, Oreki.

233
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,293
Thank you so very much. I mean it!

234
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,327
Maybe it'll make for a nice change.

235
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:22,115
So his story is still going around.

236
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,544
But is that really how it happened?

237
00:10:30,382 --> 00:10:32,465
Why it was in no way a heroic tale.

238
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,229
In fact, I've confirmed it already.

239
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,535
but I still remember it so clearly.

240
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:26,682
Wanna tell us what you're thinking?

241
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,136
I think it's "ice cream." Isn't it?

242
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:43,713
That's okay. I can understand that.

243
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:21,094
Is that why you wanted me to do it?

244
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,333
Just something I picked up, I guess.

245
00:24:21,145 --> 00:24:23,187
Don't waste time complaining, Oreki.

246
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,018
Well at least we solved the mystery.

247
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:21,151
All of you just do so much, you know?

248
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,420
We've been looking into Jun Sekitani.

249
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:06,399
It's either incorrect, or incomplete.

250
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,867
Or at least that's how I imagined it.

251
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:36,587
High school's all sunshine and roses.

252
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,982
What's more, sis called it a tragedy.

253
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:09,162
Sounds like they were very committed.

254
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:33,060
<i>Hyouka</i> is wordplay, plain and simple.

255
00:21:03,664 --> 00:21:05,475
That's not much of a message, though.

256
00:22:43,873 --> 00:22:46,376
I was terrified of being eaten alive.

257
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,754
We don't want him getting complacent.

258
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,065
About how we would probably need help

259
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,816
The so-called kindhearted hero, right?

260
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,089
People hung banners and made speeches.

261
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:20,580
I don't understand what you're saying.

262
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,795
It all depends on how you say it, huh?

263
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:56,926
you're the one who solved the mystery.

264
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,333
It's the anthology's featured article.

265
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,629
I want to live my life in the present.

266
00:26:52,525 --> 00:26:54,304
I'll go ahead and wrap this letter up.

267
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:12,669
We're working on the anthology. <i>Hyouka</i>.

268
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,003
You called us in to say you don't know?

269
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,629
during the protest all those years ago.

270
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:21,399
so we were throwing a tantrum about it.

271
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:35,406
they conducted their own investigation.

272
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:11,379
You know I'm an energy conservationist.

273
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:42,897
I mean, you could've bailed on us today.

274
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,664
Is that the type of person I want to be?

275
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,284
Wait. Off-limits? Tragedy? The poor kid?

276
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:32,407
Thank you again for your help yesterday.

277
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,243
Originally the two meant the same thing.

278
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,468
Our resident academic genius has spoken.

279
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:23,542
I was right. She's got the info we need.

280
00:12:42,254 --> 00:12:44,938
Either way, Oreki, that's not very nice.

281
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:24,837
No! It's like you witnessed it yourself.

282
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:36,198
Nobody wanted to be the official leader.

283
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,749
Jun Sekitani's battle for the Kanyasai...

284
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:58,810
It starts with the character for "alive."

285
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:24,981
Miss Itoigawa... Will you please tell us?

286
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,242
Honestly, it wasn't as noble as all that.

287
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,029
Is that because it was rebuilt back then?

288
00:20:55,298 --> 00:20:57,587
How do you translate <i>Hyouka</i> into English?

289
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:23,420
He was totally happy to fall on his sword.

290
00:08:52,905 --> 00:08:54,754
It can also be read as "offerings," right?

291
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:57,094
Except "offerings" is spelled differently.

292
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,087
We'll find out what happened 45 years ago.

293
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,442
So... You're the one who wrote this, then?

294
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:30,112
that restless energy became more agitated,

295
00:22:11,211 --> 00:22:15,334
And that if I was ever weak, if someday...

296
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:00,685
It's the longest story in the whole thing.

297
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:57,302
You think I can't survive a mugging or two?

298
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:02,697
I presented my theory to the others, but...

299
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,950
A lot closer than you would probably think.

300
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,263
I still have a bit of shelving to get done.

301
00:11:37,549 --> 00:11:39,767
You don't mind if we talk out here, do you?

302
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,680
I would like to see him again so very much.

303
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,443
Why is the club's anthology called <i>Hyouka</i> ?

304
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,937
The way "Kanya" is written in "Kanyasai"...

305
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,812
What does it even mean to have a sunny life?

306
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,031
But before we go any further, Miss Itoigawa,

307
00:12:08,512 --> 00:12:11,015
I'm surprised to see it unearthed like this.

308
00:13:04,657 --> 00:13:07,065
He left for India, and then he went missing.

309
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,262
Just what happened here all those years ago?

310
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,632
They cried out about injustice and autonomy,

311
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:25,704
That's how it seems, looking back on it now.

312
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,903
We just sat back and watched as it happened.

313
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,504
That's what you wanted to know about, right?

314
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:30,954
Except calling it that's kind of misleading,

315
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,774
I can't pretend those feelings don't matter.

316
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,173
What else can you tell me about Jun Sekitani?

317
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:41,323
And also, what really happened to your uncle.

318
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:01,114
Jun Sekitani. That name brings back memories.

319
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:53,923
for the greater good of the protest movement?

320
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,805
We're still missing that piece of the puzzle.

321
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:13,905
If it does mean something, I don't know what.

322
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:39,668
Sorry, I'm still trying to figure it all out.

323
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,485
Maybe I'm just tired of my little black cloud.

324
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:40,301
Except relaxing's begun to feel boring lately.

325
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:20,924
Then there's my sister, the queen of sunshine.

326
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,859
Hold on a sec, I'm talking about Jun Sekitani.

327
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,876
The fire spread to the combat sports building.

328
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:40,337
Jun Sekitani wouldn't have any regrets. But me?

329
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,837
That doesn't exactly sound sunny or rosy to me.

330
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:55,481
Why don't we talk about this more in my office?

331
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,404
And then, as part of a demonstration one night,

332
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,002
we built a bonfire to show how serious we were.

333
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:46,321
I've got a question about this special feature.

334
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,045
How did I end up being in charge of writing it?

335
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,337
"Anyway, that's all I've got to report for now.

336
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,570
I can't believe he's actually calling a meeting.

337
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,416
Okay, great, so it could mean one of two things.

338
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,767
She has a unique way of spelling her first name.

339
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:01,843
We should probably start heading to the library.

340
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:03,315
hoping to bend the administration to their will.

341
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:31,090
the school couldn't possibly look the other way.

342
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,693
And the rabbit fighting the dog is Jun Sekitani.

343
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:26,156
The real statement that Jun Sekitani was making.

344
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:50,898
The Truth that was Hidden for Forty-Five years."

345
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,355
I wouldn't have thought there'd be any reason to.

346
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,904
If Chitanda wasn't such a crazy curiosity monkey,

347
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,662
I assume that answers the question for you, then.

348
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,488
Sekitani could sense he was going to be expelled,

349
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,432
Where'd you learn to make a storyboard like this?

350
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:27,825
Now, Fuku, about the article you'll be writing...

351
00:26:01,224 --> 00:26:03,917
How much did you know about the Classic Lit Club?

352
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:56,096
At the end of the day, is that really what I want?

353
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:48,014
I don't think we've completely settled it all yet.

354
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:42,132
There's just one thing I'm not totally sure about.

355
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,679
something that would resonate for decades to come.

356
00:23:31,629 --> 00:23:33,997
Wow, thanks for putting all this together, Mayaka!

357
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,778
If I hadn't joined the Classic Lit Club this year,

358
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,392
Why do something like that if not to help Chitanda?

359
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:15,920
Are you suggesting that your theory was incomplete?

360
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,951
If we go and ask Miss Itoigawa about all of this...

361
00:12:11,348 --> 00:12:14,319
I think I might know what it is you want to ask me.

362
00:19:13,087 --> 00:19:16,154
Does it stand for "Sekitani" instead of "Kamiyama"?

363
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:48,744
The one you call "The Case of the Kindhearted Hero:

364
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,699
Did you know I'd start wondering about this stuff?"

365
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:24,170
I guess this means that, somewhere, pigs are flying.

366
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:38,383
We read that but excluded it from our deliberations.

367
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,840
I set up an appointment so we could all talk to her.

368
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:27,936
What you describe is almost exactly how it happened.

369
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,984
That year the principal dropped a bombshell, saying:

370
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:53,234
That announcement triggered an unprecedented uproar.

371
00:16:43,764 --> 00:16:46,536
He wound up as the scapegoat for the whole movement.

372
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,225
He said that it was the only thing left he could do.

373
00:25:57,872 --> 00:26:00,223
I'm writing because I've got some questions for you.

374
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:40,348
Put it how you want. You do this stuff 'cause of her.

375
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:35,667
Why the picture on the anthology cover is what it is.

376
00:26:15,803 --> 00:26:18,202
I probably wouldn't have given that a second thought.

377
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:14,818
So you got marching orders from Hotaro too, I take it?

378
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,656
I hope it doesn't take long. I'm busy with Manga Club.

379
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:43,777
Yeah, but I think maybe we shouldn't have excluded it.

380
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:53,176
She's Yoko Itoigawa, but she used to be Yoko Koriyama.

381
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,034
So nobody needs to go poking around in my brain, okay?

382
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,908
Why was the story involving my uncle not a heroic one?

383
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,799
Everyone else did the real work. I just summarized it.

384
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,040
The high school cultural festival was a very big deal.

385
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:19,267
Yes. If a day ever came when I couldn't even scream...

386
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,908
No. It can be read as either "sacrifice" or "offering."

387
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:44,270
So he put it right there in the title of the anthology.

388
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:31,925
And I think I know why you're going to all this trouble.

389
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:27,747
I'm starting to wonder if you might have the right idea.

390
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:37,097
How much of Oreki's theory about the protest is correct?

391
00:15:21,835 --> 00:15:25,005
and using the festival as an outlet for self-expression.

392
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,283
and we found ourselves at the edge of a full-blown riot.

393
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,354
I'll send another letter that way once I get to Sarajevo.

394
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,418
Despite firefighting efforts, it was partially destroyed.

395
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:10,632
If you'd prefer, I can try to take it on myself, instead.

396
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,321
Was Jun Sekitani's high school life really all that sunny?

397
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,372
why are you kids so interested in what happened back then?

398
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,778
So 20 years ago when the rest of the school was remodeled,

399
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,906
But I'm just not sure that's a gamble I'm willing to take.

400
00:01:28,447 --> 00:01:31,180
Sometimes when I watch you
guys, it makes me feel restless.

401
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,261
I'll really get invested in
something, the way you guys do.

402
00:04:57,749 --> 00:05:00,163
So that's the kind of trouble
you're getting yourself into.

403
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:16,545
For a lot of kids, it seemed
like the only purpose in life.

404
00:19:30,979 --> 00:19:34,291
since Jun Sekitani was really
more of a victim than a hero.

405
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:04,626
and he was uncharacteristically
intent on using that title,

406
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:36,501
That you accepted the anthology
assignment Mayaka gave you.

407
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:48,799
If you know what <i>Hyouka</i> means,
will you please just tell us?

408
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:46,915
I guess Jun Sekitani would
know all about that, wouldn't he?

409
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,901
Because it seemed like it was
just an opinion and not a fact.

410
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:17,750
Really. You should donate your
brain to science or something.

411
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:20,611
you're curious about the
protests that occurred 45 years ago.

412
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:32,813
I'm not sure what more I can
tell you about it, to be honest.

413
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:50,023
Eventually, he was found guilty
and expelled from the school.

414
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:50,786
Somebody else was actually
running the show behind the scenes.

415
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:30,986
I drew up an outline and a
schedule for writing the anthology.

416
00:12:28,268 --> 00:12:31,201
I thought everyone would have
forgotten about it by this point.

417
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,836
Most people call the cultural
festival Kanyasai, but you don't.

418
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:07,556
And why was it so important to
you that I get involved with it?

419
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:35,208
Ten years from now, how will I
feel when I look back at my life?

420
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,499
But only the person who wrote
it knows for sure which one it is.

421
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,906
You know, I'd always hoped I'd
be able to see him again someday.

422
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,203
Pathetic as it sounds, we were
all too afraid of being punished.

423
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:03,734
I went to my uncle, and asked
if he'd tell me what Hyouka meant.

424
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:04,276
I'm sure it had something to do
with what you said to me before.

425
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,137
if we were going to solve the
mystery before my uncle's funeral.

426
00:06:16,697 --> 00:06:20,368
He left school as a martyr for
what he thought was a noble cause.

427
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:30,087
I think we should've given more
weight to what it said in <i>Hyouka</i>.

428
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:27,927
But what I don't understand is
why anyone is asking about it now.

429
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,993
I'm sure he'll tell you all about
it if you don't mind listening.

430
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:45,836
As a matter of fact, we banned
that name in the Classic Lit Club.

431
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,715
There are some gaps in the story,
but I think we can fill them in.

432
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:49,340
Now, then, you said there was
something you wanted to ask me about.

433
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:54,526
I suggested that you ask Satoshi
and Ibara to help you out with it.

434
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:20,899
I wouldn't expect you to put effort
into solving a mystery like this.

435
00:09:13,524 --> 00:09:16,535
The best that we're going to be
able to do is make an educated guess.

436
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,402
Whether he volunteered himself as
a sacrifice for the other students?

437
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:09,985
I don't know anyone in this world
less energy efficient than Chitanda.

438
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:37,920
I seriously doubt that we'd all be
here asking you about it right now.

439
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,316
I'd say it was more like someone
had threatened to take away our toys,

440
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:18,712
Mm-hmm. We all have to meet up in
the clubroom to talk about something.

441
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:12,892
Those kids weren't afraid to stand
up for what they really cared about.

442
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:01,410
Are you starting to see that living
a sunny life isn't so bad after all?

443
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:44,113
Everyone was afraid that meant the
cultural festival would be abolished.

444
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:30,337
The story we just heard makes it
clear what the anthology's title means.

445
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:02,981
We'd whipped ourselves into a
self-righteous frenzy as only the young can.

446
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:41,148
Can you really call it "accepting"
if somebody forces you to do something?

447
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:21,435
Whether or not things change as time
passes, what I'm feeling now is real.

448
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:55,450
Yeah. She said that when she was a
second-year, she was the club president.

449
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:59,000
The administration would give in to
us eventually, but we didn't know that.

450
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,795
I mean either we went off in the wrong
direction or we didn't go far enough.

451
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:38,337
Jun Sekitani wanted to leave an enduring
message about what happened to him,

452
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:10,528
it means that our Kanyasai came at the
cost of somebody's high school career.

453
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,866
holding his head high as he knowingly
sacrificed his whole high school career

454
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:17,051
We've got to put Mr. Lazy Bones to
work somehow, and this is our best chance.

455
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:10,831
In addition to all the rallies and
speeches, students were boycotting classes.

456
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:25,219
The years passed, and sure enough, the
cultural festival was shortened anyway,

457
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:52,676
The combat sports building is by far
the oldest facility we have at Kami High.

458
00:00:43,082 --> 00:00:46,941
The responsibility for unraveling that
mystery was split between the four of us.

459
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:25,186
Did you know somehow that it would force
me to reconsider my priorities in life?

460
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,074
Did Jun Sekitani willingly take the hit
for the other students who were involved?

461
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:13,887
I know it's possible that 10 years from
now, I won't care so much about all this.

462
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:21,295
Like I've said before, I'm not doing
anything special. It's just luck, that's all.

463
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:14,597
And you put together this theory from
nothing more than the material you have here?

464
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:39,178
The drawing on the anthology's cover is
supposed to symbolize what happened, right?

465
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:56,301
Instead, you locked yourself in the
bathroom until you could come up with an answer.

466
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:38,017
Hotaro seems to think that something about
his theory is either wrong or incomplete.

467
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,339
"We can't content ourselves with being a
small-time school in a sleepy little town."

468
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:27,460
They took "Sekitani-sai" and switched the
reading to make it "Kanyasai" to honor Jun.

469
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:12,501
If he's still alive, does Jun Sekitani
have any regrets about his time in high school?

470
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:33,651
To be kicked out of school over a festival
and have a whole phase of his life altered?

471
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:52,170
How many people could sacrifice everything
and not feel a bit of resentment or regret?

472
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:30,002
Forty-five years ago she was a first-year
in high school, so today she'd be around 60.

473
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:02,845
that building was still new enough that it
didn't need to be fixed up like the others.

474
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:35,253
It clearly states in the foreword that Jun
Sekitani's story is in no way a heroic tale.

475
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:53,441
Do you have any idea why my uncle chose
<i>Hyouka</i> to be the title of the club's anthology?

476
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:29,150
Funny thing is, it's not even the first
mystery you've solved since high school started.

477
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:07,216
And let's not forget how she reacted when
she found out we were in the Classic Lit Club.

478
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:51,352
If you'd said "I've got no clue" and left it
at that, I doubt anyone would've blamed you.

479
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:28,199
"This has been a lot of fun, and I know I'll
look back in 10 years and be glad I did it."

480
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,668
In those years, it was almost as if students
were channeling the nation's restless energy

481
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:48,649
It wasn't, but the principal did inform us
that the festival would last for only two days,

482
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,645
Something tells me if people knew that, they
probably wouldn't even use the term Kanyasai.

483
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:36,428
Does being more passionate about stuff make
life more exciting or just more heartbreaking?

484
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:46,379
Instead, they settled for making an example
of the movement's nominal leader, Jun Sekitani.

485
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:58,817
You didn't seem to like the idea much at
first, so what made you change your mind about it?

486
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:46,844
Oreki pieced together some information and
came up with a possible outline of what went down

487
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:14,943
Being a club president, taking midterms,
writing an anthology, solving riddles from the past?

488
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:31,773
At any rate, we formed a sort of coalition to
protest the shortening of the cultural festival.

489
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:56,688
I don't really think you would call a meeting
like this unless something important was going on.

490
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:14,373
I mean, I've been working with her this whole
time and the name thing never even occurred to me.

491
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,795
Well, that's the end of my story, unless you
have any other questions that you'd like to ask me.

492
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:48,156
Sure, it's possible that Miss Itoigawa is who
we're looking for, but do you have any solid proof?

493
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:01,914
And she looks around 60, which is just about how
old the foreword's author would be at this point.

494
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:12,291
There are still a few tiny holes in our theory
about Chitanda's uncle, and I'm trying to close them.

495
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:41,460
But having your high-school experience cut short
because you and your friends wanted a longer festival?

496
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:40,712
Since almost all the students were involved with
the movement, they couldn't very well punish everyone.

497
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:04,396
And that's why you assume his expulsion was delayed
until October; they wanted to let the tension die down?

498
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:54,537
could you do me a favor and
confirm for my fellow club

499
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:57,295
members here that your maiden
name is, in fact, Yoko Koriyama?
