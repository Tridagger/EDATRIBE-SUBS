1
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:29,579
Wow. Looks like Sho made the finals.

2
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,589
Yeah. That's what it says.

3
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,686
Mm-hm!

4
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,767
He's amazing.

5
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:39,704
Seeing something like that makes me wonder
if I have any natural talents, but I doubt it.

6
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:42,544
I'm pretty sure the gifted genes skipped right over me.

7
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,615
I keep trying to tell myself I'm just a late bloomer.

8
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:47,335
That's only wishful thinking, though.

9
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,416
Come on, what do ya mean? You're a human database.

10
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:53,199
Yeah, I am quite proud of that
trait: my ability to store information.

11
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,774
But even if I put effort into developing
it, I'll never be a quiz show king.

12
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,158
Really?

13
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:00,813
Heck no. And I resent it.

14
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,169
I envy people like Sho.

15
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:04,801
Being a talented genius has its disadvantages, too.

16
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:05,754
Yeah, like what?

17
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:10,680
Extraordinary people don't even have the option to
lead a normal, boring existence like the rest of us do.

18
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:11,505
Uh...

19
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,623
Hold on.

20
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,000
You think a mundane life is better somehow?

21
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:16,891
You would think that.

22
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,018
You're such a weirdo.

23
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:18,579
Mm...

24
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,690
I wonder if you'll actually be able to live a normal life.

25
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,533
What is that supposed to mean?

26
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:27,991
Look, I've accepted that I don't have any special talents.

27
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,105
I think the jury is still out on you, though,

28
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:33,297
so I'm gonna hold off on making
a determination a bit longer.

29
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:36,276
If you think I could live an extraordinary life,

30
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,477
I have to question your powers of observation.

31
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,410
Hey, I'm still gathering evidence. Gimme a break here.

32
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:42,687
Anyway...

33
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,907
We should probably hurry along to the meeting.

34
00:04:45,113 --> 00:04:47,926
Mayaka will have both our hides if we show up late again.

35
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,118
That's for sure.

36
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,747
It's summer vacation, for crying out loud.

37
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:52,891
You're late!

38
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,457
Ah...!

39
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,394
Yeah, laugh it up.

40
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,143
You two are in deep trouble.

41
00:04:58,168 --> 00:04:59,162
Where's Chitanda?

42
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,494
Oh. She hasn't shown up yet either.

43
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,211
I'm a little worried.

44
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:05,467
That's a pretty stark disparity.

45
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,300
There's a disparity in your behavior.

46
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:08,691
I'm so sorry I'm late!

47
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,194
There's a film screening!

48
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:11,694
You guys!

49
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,294
Do you wanna see a student film?

50
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:17,387
Class 2-F produced a movie, and they're
gonna be showing it in a few minutes!

51
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:18,283
Hm?

52
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:21,304
I have a friend who's in that class,
and we were just talking about it.

53
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,908
That's actually why I was late.

54
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:26,308
She wants some outside input on the
film, so she asked if we would watch it.

55
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,722
What kind of movie is it?

56
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,662
Um, she said it was a murder mystery.

57
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:30,667
Oh, yeah?

58
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,107
Well, that's right up our alley.

59
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,539
I think this is the place.

60
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,767
We decided to take you up on your invitation.

61
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:41,466
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

62
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,047
Thanks for coming.

63
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:45,829
I appreciate you taking the time to help us out with this.

64
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:52,110
This is Mayaka Ibara.

65
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,582
That's Satoshi Fukube.

66
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,012
And he's Hotaro Oreki.

67
00:05:55,226 --> 00:05:58,087
We're all in the Classic Lit Club
together, as I mentioned earlier.

68
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,248
Nice to meet you.

69
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,432
My name is Fuyumi Irisu.

70
00:06:01,723 --> 00:06:03,061
Oh! Now I remember.

71
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:04,270
You and I have met before.

72
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,612
I thought you looked familiar. I was right!

73
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,130
Uh, I don't remember you.

74
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:09,253
Sorry about that.

75
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:12,254
Oh, we were both on the cultural
festival planning committee.

76
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:15,648
We mediated that dispute between the
Light Music Club and the Drama Club?

77
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,179
Talk about drama!

78
00:06:17,392 --> 00:06:20,206
I've never seen Satoshi so eager to please.

79
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:22,241
Yeah, sorry, still doesn't ring a bell.

80
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,511
U-Uh... No worries.

81
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,870
Hey, Chi, how do you know this girl?

82
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:29,296
My family and the Irisu family
have been close for generations.

83
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,457
I've know her for as long as I can remember.

84
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,817
Being old money sure seems like a lot of work.

85
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,123
Anyway... Here is a copy of the movie
the other kids in my class produced.

86
00:06:38,226 --> 00:06:41,712
I'd be grateful if you would watch it
and tell me your honest opinions of it.

87
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:43,279
Sure, we can't wait!

88
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:49,361
So all we have to do is watch
it and tell you what we think?

89
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:51,329
Yes, is that strange to you?

90
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:55,019
Well, if we don't like it, does that mean
you're going to reshoot the parts we criticize,

91
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,656
or are you just showing us for some free publicity?

92
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,924
Neither.

93
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:01,883
Then I don't understand what
you gain from showing it to us.

94
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,164
You bring up a legitimate point.

95
00:07:04,227 --> 00:07:07,532
The purpose involves your opinions,
but it's not about the quality, per se.

96
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:11,496
I just think it's more efficient to show
you the film before explaining further.

97
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,797
So?

98
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,236
I guess I'll wait and see.

99
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:20,846
Our movie doesn't have an official title yet,

100
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,204
but the working title is "Mystery."

101
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:28,069
Once the film is over, I'll be asking you
specific questions, so please pay attention.

102
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:30,341
All right. Let's get things started.

103
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:32,574
I'll be back in a bit. Happy hunting.

104
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:33,551
"Hunting?"

105
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,745
These students from Class 2-F have
decided to participate in the Kanyasai.

106
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,875
They need supplies from the Narakubo area for
their exhibit and are now heading to the site.

107
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:48,579
How much farther is it?

108
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,747
Not much farther. We should be there in five more minutes.

109
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:57,400
You said the same thing five minutes ago!

110
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,867
This is pretty tough going.

111
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:05,307
I'm hot, and I'm starting to feel tired and hungry.

112
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,731
You're not the only one who is hot and tired!

113
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,298
Now! We gotta keep marching!

114
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,527
About what I'd expect from a student film.

115
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,124
Mm-hm. Yes, I see it.

116
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,839
That's Narakubo over there.

117
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,109
So awesome.

118
00:08:23,134 --> 00:08:23,676
You're right.

119
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:25,923
I think it was worth the trek to get supplies.

120
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,954
All that aside, it would be wise to find a place
to camp for the night before hunting for materials!

121
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:31,633
You're right.

122
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:34,012
That looks like a good place, over there, doesn't it?

123
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:35,121
Let's go see!

124
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,522
I dunno, guys.

125
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,560
I have a bad feeling about this.

126
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:53,762
A haunted theater!

127
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:54,836
A haunted theater?

128
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,954
It's so dusty.

129
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:03,551
The roof seems like it's holding up okay, though.

130
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,382
It's too dangerous to sleep in this room.

131
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,043
There's glass scattered about!

132
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:14,388
We need to find somewhere to camp before it gets dark out.

133
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,018
I think I found a floorplan over here.

134
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,329
Oh! It is a floorplan!

135
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,529
Let's split up and explore the building!

136
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,196
Hey! That sounds dangerous!

137
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:31,502
And I am certain all the doors in here are locked!

138
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:34,973
There has to be a set of keys
lying around this place somewhere.

139
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,790
What is that? An office?

140
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,086
What do you think those keys are for?

141
00:09:59,189 --> 00:10:01,167
I think those are the master keys.

142
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,756
We should leave them here.

143
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,847
It would be bad if they got lost.

144
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,409
Yeah, that's a good idea.

145
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,452
We found keys.

146
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,128
They should unlock all the rooms in the house.

147
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:22,221
Okay, let's split up and see what we can find.

148
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:23,287
Right.

149
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,789
If this were reality,

150
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:27,442
there's no way they'd all split up, you know what I mean?

151
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,531
What are you getting at?

152
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:32,438
Something's about to happen. I can feel it... can't you?

153
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:34,346
What?

154
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:35,900
He was the one talking to me!

155
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,635
The incident occurred soon after.

156
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:47,082
See, I told you so!

157
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:47,844
Hm?

158
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,575
Did you find anything?

159
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:02,136
There are pieces of broken mirror everywhere.
We can't use any of the rooms I've seen.

160
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:04,971
None of the rooms that I saw would work, either.

161
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,731
Hey, Sugimura!

162
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,061
What did you find up there?

163
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:11,833
Well, it's pretty clean, mostly.

164
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:13,112
The rooms in this wing...

165
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,772
...might be our best options.

166
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,988
Hey, where's Kaito?

167
00:11:17,265 --> 00:11:18,783
He must still be lookin' around.

168
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:19,736
Let's go find him.

169
00:11:19,855 --> 00:11:21,420
Maybe he found something worth seeing.

170
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:31,455
Is this a sitting room?

171
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,488
No Kaito here.

172
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,319
Hm? Not in here, either.

173
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:57,283
Farther down, maybe?

174
00:12:09,806 --> 00:12:10,847
This one's locked.

175
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,902
It won't budge. That's kinda weird.

176
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,293
What should we do?

177
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:15,588
I'll go get the master keys.

178
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:17,209
Yeah, I'll come with you.

179
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:26,621
Kaito!

180
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,090
Th-There's blood everywhere!

181
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:39,280
Oh, no. What is that?

182
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:47,534
I'm amazed she can buy into this nonsense.

183
00:12:47,764 --> 00:12:49,639
Damn it! He's dead!

184
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:06,839
Oh, no.

185
00:13:12,768 --> 00:13:14,603
Um... Is that it?

186
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,042
But, wait.

187
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,575
There's no way that's the ending!

188
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,436
That's all we have so far.

189
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,312
So, what's the point of this screening?

190
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:27,499
I'd like to know who you all
think is the culprit in the film.

191
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:40,296
I will explain the whole thing in a moment,
but first, I want to hear each of your opinions.

192
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:41,949
Technically speaking,

193
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,071
what would be your impressions of our film?

194
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,909
Well, if I could be perfectly honest,

195
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:50,553
I think it's a bit clumsy.

196
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:53,199
I agree with that assessment.

197
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,520
No matter how much passion goes into a
film, without real skill, it feels amateur.

198
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,760
But isn't that okay?

199
00:13:58,863 --> 00:14:00,304
I mean it is an amateur film.

200
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,369
Yes. I think it's fine enough work for what it is.

201
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:07,086
A student film should get some leeway
to be a bit self-indulgent, right?

202
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,120
Mm-hm.

203
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,319
Let's not get bogged down discussing aesthetics.

204
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:11,631
I was just curious.

205
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:15,341
What's the most obvious issue
with the project, as it stands?

206
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:18,876
The fact that it's nowhere near finished?

207
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:19,924
Yes.

208
00:14:19,964 --> 00:14:22,230
Even if it's not perfect, we have to complete it.

209
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,216
The crew shot at a unique location,

210
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:28,412
and we were only able to do so during the
summer break, which has proven to be problematic.

211
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:31,405
Why do you say that? Did the shoot not go as scheduled?

212
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,037
The actual shoot went according to plan.

213
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,199
We were supposed to wrap everything
up right on time, next Sunday.

214
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,075
Okay, so what's the problem, then?

215
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,235
The script's not done.

216
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,078
Mayu Hongo has written manga,

217
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:47,512
which is more experience than anyone else in
class, so she agreed to write the hour-long screen play.

218
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:48,878
That's a tall order!

219
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,802
She did pretty well with it, overall.

220
00:14:50,834 --> 00:14:55,123
But when she reached the point that you saw in
the film, she got very sick and couldn't finish.

221
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:57,443
Wait a minute.

222
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:59,126
Do you expect us to take over?

223
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:01,329
I could never ask anything like that of you.

224
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:03,814
Now then, getting back to my earlier question.

225
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,450
Who do you think committed the murder?

226
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:08,787
Hongo got sick just as we were getting to the resolution.

227
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:13,110
I think that someone who watched the film up to
this point should be able to deduce who did it.

228
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,774
But are there really going to be enough clues to
figure that out in a screenplay by a novice writer?

229
00:15:18,854 --> 00:15:20,246
I believe there should be.

230
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:23,509
Hongo immersed herself and
focused mostly on Sherlock Holmes.

231
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:27,053
She followed the Ten Commandments,
Nine Propositions, and the Twenty Rules.

232
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,062
Oh, yeah?

233
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,415
What, like from the Bible?

234
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,002
No, Knox's Ten Commandments.

235
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:37,531
Those, plus the Nine Propositions and Twenty
Rules dictate what makes a good detective story.

236
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:38,406
Correct.

237
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,369
They say the keys to solving the crime
must always be presented fairly to the reader.

238
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,714
So, with that in mind, who do you
think is the culprit in this case?

239
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:47,725
That's what she meant by, "Happy hunting."

240
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,982
I'm not very good with that kind of question.

241
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:52,660
I store information. I don't know how to interpret it.

242
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:53,740
Me, either.

243
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,758
I don't pay much attention to details.

244
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,236
Though, I suspect there's someone here who does.

245
00:15:59,216 --> 00:15:59,736
Hm?

246
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:02,938
Don't look at me.

247
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:03,787
Why not?

248
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,429
This is right up your alley, isn't it?

249
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,613
You are the star detective of
the Classic Lit Club, after all.

250
00:16:08,913 --> 00:16:10,622
C'mon, why the sour face?

251
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:12,537
I wasn't watching with that in mind.

252
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:15,116
In that case, let's ask her to show us the movie again.

253
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:16,541
What? Give me a break!

254
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,234
There's no need to overthink it.

255
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,132
I just want an outside opinion.

256
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh, is that right?

257
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,113
Well, then I think Yamanishi is the murderer for sure.

258
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,836
What makes you say that?

259
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,471
'Cause I don't like her crappy attitude.

260
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:29,825
Oreki! Don't play around!

261
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:36,990
Hey, Irisu, why don't you try
to figure out who the murderer is?

262
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,850
I don't have any experience with mysteries.

263
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:40,437
No?

264
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:44,338
Well, if that's the case, then why'd you let
the class choose it as the genre for your project?

265
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:47,677
I wasn't attached to the film yet
when they were making those decisions.

266
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,371
I got back from my family vacation to Hokkaido,
and the film was already in this sticky predicament.

267
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,137
I jumped in the day before yesterday to sort it out.

268
00:16:55,162 --> 00:16:57,321
If I'd been involved, I doubt it would have moved forward.

269
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:58,364
One more question.

270
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:01,955
Why did you call on the Classic Lit
Club to help you out with this issue?

271
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,815
Well, first, I knew Chitanda would have my back on this.

272
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,817
And secondly, I heard all about the <i>Hyouka</i> business.

273
00:17:10,876 --> 00:17:11,416
Huh?

274
00:17:12,186 --> 00:17:14,180
I didn't think anyone else knew about that.

275
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:16,033
Did Miss Itoigawa tell her?

276
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:20,157
When I agreed to help my classmates out of
this mess, I remembered what I'd heard about you.

277
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:24,319
I thought that perhaps I could enlist you as
my detectives and solve the problem even faster.

278
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:26,322
Well, don't expect us to do all the work.

279
00:17:26,472 --> 00:17:27,347
Not at all.

280
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:30,177
I sincerely apologize if I gave you that impression.

281
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:31,756
Please forgive me.

282
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,290
So, that's the end of this morning's screening.

283
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,833
Well, then. Thanks for coming.

284
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,228
Hey! Please, wait a minute!

285
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,349
What's going to happen with the end of the movie, then?

286
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,243
I don't know.

287
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,411
We'll do our best with what we have.

288
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,995
But I am bracing for the possibility that we won't finish.

289
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,495
We can't let that happen.

290
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,673
I would be heartbroken to know
all their hard work was done in vain!

291
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:00,494
I just don't think I could bear it!

292
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:01,716
What's it to her?

293
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,020
Irisu should be upset.

294
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:03,579
Yeah.

295
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,388
It would be frustrating to leave it unfinished like that!

296
00:18:06,547 --> 00:18:07,485
I agree.

297
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,908
You all came together as a team to get it done.

298
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:13,746
And also, Hongo worked herself to
the point of illness for this project!

299
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,004
Why would she go to such great
lengths just to give up halfway through?

300
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,076
I just... I have to know!

301
00:18:24,128 --> 00:18:26,330
Let's help them out, Hotaro. Why not?

302
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,928
Got something better to do?

303
00:18:28,786 --> 00:18:30,381
We must do this, Oreki.

304
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,701
Let's avenge Hongo's death and solve this crime!

305
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,148
Hongo isn't dead. She's sick.

306
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,729
Ah! Oh, that's right.

307
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,341
We have to help them, Oreki!

308
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,579
What happens if we do decide to help, but we
can't figure out who the murderer is either?

309
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:48,401
Are we supposed to just bow down
and beg for forgiveness from Class 2-F?

310
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,634
I don't want that kind of responsibility.

311
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,668
I'll make you a deal.

312
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,458
How about you act as observers, rather than detectives?

313
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,283
Observers?

314
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:01,486
Uh...

315
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:04,355
You'd listen to the opinions of
our class's appointed detectives,

316
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,016
then offer your viewpoints,
and that'd be the extent of it.

317
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:08,079
Well?

318
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,170
That sounds okay. Deal.

319
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:22,118
Thanks so much. I appreciate it.

320
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:29,302
Irisu's family is pretty famous.

321
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,709
That's the reason right over there.

322
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:33,815
The Irisus have run the general hospital for decades now.

323
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:36,985
Oh, so she's the heiress to a giant medical fortune.

324
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:40,694
Yeah, but that's not the only reason
Irisu, herself, is well-known around here.

325
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:42,577
People at school have given her a nickname.

326
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:43,872
Do you know what they call her?

327
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:45,126
No idea.

328
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,526
"The Empress."

329
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,940
Why... does she rule people?

330
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,729
Ugh, she's not a dominatrix.

331
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,491
I set it up, you knocked it down.

332
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:52,239
I salute you.

333
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:53,287
What are you doing?

334
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:55,441
Well, she's pretty, but that's not the whole reason.

335
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:58,024
I've heard she can get anyone to do her bidding.

336
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,829
People are drawn to her, and before they know it,

337
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,099
she's manipulated them into being her pawns.

338
00:20:02,124 --> 00:20:04,483
What? Well, that's not creepy at all.

339
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,486
Maybe, but I have to say,

340
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:09,425
the Empress was generous enough
to grant us an audience with her.

341
00:20:09,478 --> 00:20:12,238
We might do well to adopt our own symbols in her honor.

342
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,468
What do you mean?

343
00:20:13,657 --> 00:20:16,065
Mayaka should be... "Justice."

344
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,871
It's between that and "Judgement."

345
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:19,121
I don't get it.

346
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:20,704
Symbols from the Tarot deck.

347
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,602
Huh.

348
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:23,773
Well, Fuku, what would you be?

349
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,089
"The Fool," I think.

350
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,109
Nah, "The Magician" is better.

351
00:20:27,579 --> 00:20:29,626
I think Chitanda should be "The Fool."

352
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:32,996
Yeah, you're right.

353
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:35,787
"The Fool" really does suit me, now that you mention it.

354
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:39,448
Impulsiveness is definitely
one of my shortcomings, after all.

355
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:40,814
I'm lost.

356
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:41,928
Yeah, same.

357
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:42,962
What about Oreki?

358
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:45,296
That's a no-brainer. He'd be "Strength."

359
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,536
Huh? Seriously?

360
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,998
If I had to pick, I would label him "The Star," instead.

361
00:20:50,085 --> 00:20:52,016
Nope. This guy's Strength, for sure.

362
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:53,217
It's perfect for him.

363
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:56,635
Hmph. I have a suspicion that's not a compliment.

364
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,639
That's a fair assessment.

365
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:01,456
You're a total jerk.

366
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:15,690
Not a chance.

367
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,570
Yeah?

368
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,953
Well, good morning, Oreki.

369
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:26,304
I thought we could walk together.

370
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:30,762
Does she have to be so polite all the time?

371
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,204
Good morning, everyone!

372
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,164
Morning.

373
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:36,769
Mornin'!

374
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:40,351
I'm excited that we get to meet the detectives today.

375
00:21:40,462 --> 00:21:43,537
I'm looking forward to listening to
their hypotheses about the murderer.

376
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,579
When did you have time to make this happen?

377
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:46,740
Over chat.

378
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,199
Kamiyama High School has a private online chat
room that only the students are allowed to use.

379
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:53,670
Wow! I didn't know that!

380
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:54,781
You'll have to show me!

381
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,377
Yeah, that sounds fun!

382
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,777
Yes? Come on in!

383
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,883
Is this the Classic Lit Club room?

384
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:02,677
It is.

385
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,458
Are you the girl who Irisu sent from Class 2-F?

386
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:09,224
That's right. My name is Eba.
It's very nice to meet you all.

387
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,578
I believe I'm supposed to take you to meet our detectives?

388
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,589
Irisu told me she had briefed you on the film situation.

389
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:17,653
All right, follow me.

390
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:22,715
Chi, did you bring snacks today?

391
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:23,404
Yep!

392
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,362
I brought these fancy chocolates
someone sent to our house.

393
00:22:26,528 --> 00:22:30,127
I thought that it would be nice to share
them with everyone while we were working today!

394
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,579
Sounds great!

395
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:35,896
I mean, after all, it's so much harder to
think clearly when you're hungry, ya know?

396
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,408
Man, I can't wait to hear the
detectives' theories about the film!

397
00:22:39,527 --> 00:22:41,187
Aren't you so excited, Hotaro?

398
00:22:42,284 --> 00:22:44,849
I'm glad you're all having such a good time.

399
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:48,742
Hey, Eba! I have a question for ya.

400
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:49,773
Go ahead.

401
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:52,015
Who are these detectives, anyway?

402
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:55,495
The assistant director, the props master, and the PR girl.

403
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,329
Cool!

404
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,587
So what exactly is your
involvement in the filmmaking process?

405
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,400
I don't have anything to do with it, as a matter of fact.

406
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:04,106
To be honest, I wasn't interested.

407
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:06,530
Well how about that? A girl after my own heart.

408
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,416
Eba, if you don't mind my
asking, were you and Hongo close?

409
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,722
Why do you ask?

410
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,663
Oh.

411
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,026
I was just curious about the kind of person who
would be able to write a murder mystery script like this.

412
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:24,560
If I had to describe her,

413
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:25,988
I'd say...

414
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:31,906
She's a no-nonsense, meticulous person,
really responsible, kind to a fault, and fragile.

415
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,498
She's one of my best friends.

416
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:38,548
Interesting.

417
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,289
Here we are.

418
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:42,829
The film is on hiatus right now,

419
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,880
so I doubt anyone else is gonna show up.

420
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:46,334
You shouldn't be interrupted.

421
00:23:53,977 --> 00:23:56,733
Everyone, I'd like you to meet our detectives.

422
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,357
Next time:

423
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:39,222
"The Case of the Furuoka Deserted Village Murder."
