412
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:31,747
Hm?

7
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,324
Huh?

10
00:00:45,685 --> 00:00:46,566
Yes.

109
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,358
Yes.

247
00:15:04,757 --> 00:15:05,632
Hey!

45
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,249
Okay.

68
00:05:26,724 --> 00:05:27,664
'Kay.

129
00:08:56,976 --> 00:08:57,776
Okay.

195
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:35,877
Hmph.

282
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,124
Yeah.

349
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,397
Okay.

364
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:23,103
What?

3
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:26,212
Right.

95
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,000
Sorry.

230
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:27,594
Right!

236
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:42,520
Great!

298
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:25,286
But...

465
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,125
Right.

302
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,301
Gotcha.

416
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,144
<i>Hyouka</i>?

9
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:45,550
A favor?

171
00:11:41,524 --> 00:11:42,204
Shut up!

223
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,819
Hold on.

358
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,168
Exactly.

417
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:40,819
Issue 2.

8
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:44,034
I... Huh?

33
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:36,389
Anyway...

77
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:48,442
it's you!

286
00:16:56,226 --> 00:16:56,941
Y'know...

398
00:21:59,037 --> 00:21:59,926
You guys!

1
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:19,673
Excuse me.

15
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:08,739
Thank you.

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,766
Seriously?

119
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,790
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:49,425
Sorry. No.

249
00:15:08,636 --> 00:15:10,058
Of course.

278
00:16:29,219 --> 00:16:30,132
Togaito...

305
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,397
A locker?!

309
00:17:55,223 --> 00:17:55,942
So listen.

347
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,080
Of course!

413
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:33,701
Come here.

415
00:22:36,268 --> 00:22:37,196
It's this.

471
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,346
Next time:

64
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,558
This is it.

133
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,052
Yeah, sure.

203
00:12:57,835 --> 00:12:58,694
You coming?

216
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:54,320
Well, um...

396
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,585
Not at all.

400
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:05,888
About time.

98
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:07,936
It's just...

240
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,898
Don't leave!

245
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,049
You're sure?

292
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:11,169
No, I'm not.

460
00:24:57,311 --> 00:24:58,386
Yeah, kinda.

115
00:07:58,849 --> 00:07:59,891
So you see...

182
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,856
"Chi," is it?

325
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,179
Okay, I give.

448
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:17,491
I'm so close!

70
00:05:31,153 --> 00:05:32,185
Because you...

170
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey, nice hat.

261
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,309
Pretty please?

319
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:24,666
Great. Thanks.

41
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,706
Yeah? You what?

47
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,397
but my uncle...

145
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,988
And I survived.

173
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,882
Yeah, I'm sure.

180
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:02,774
Where are they?

189
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:22,809
Okay, now what?

199
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:44,099
Well, let's go!

265
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,703
And you are...?

320
00:18:25,262 --> 00:18:26,644
Okay, let's go.

340
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:31,589
Hold on, Oreki!

26
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,787
He was so smart!

81
00:05:55,551 --> 00:05:56,632
I don't want to.

104
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:23,918
What's the rush?

120
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,362
Come on, Hotaro.

143
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,338
Okay, time's up.

212
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,345
Yep, it sure is.

297
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,078
I said no, okay?

314
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,286
I... I didn't...

317
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:20,655
All right, fine.

321
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:31,134
Hey, first-year.

332
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,027
Well, let's see.

339
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,595
The anthologies.

345
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,121
Well... I dunno.

369
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:40,845
I'm not, really.

378
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:04,980
Cigarette smoke.

42
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,154
I started to cry.

146
00:10:30,007 --> 00:10:31,093
"Hey, Little Bro.

201
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:53,228
Handicrafts Club.

234
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,016
Oh... Uh... Yeah.

243
00:14:58,894 --> 00:14:59,990
There's no point.

257
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,162
The whole school?

303
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:40,908
Just so you know,

316
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,345
Who said you did?

335
00:19:05,028 --> 00:19:06,488
That explains it.

344
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:38,845
What's that mean?

360
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:14,330
More importantly,

37
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:46,971
So, what'd you do?

44
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,652
but I was bawling.

210
00:13:35,044 --> 00:13:36,014
No, that's not it.

214
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:47,540
No. Air freshener.

267
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,072
All right, I give.

323
00:18:35,862 --> 00:18:37,482
It's Hotaro Oreki.

409
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,869
What's the matter?

411
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:31,166
Well, it's just...

425
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:01,675
I'm not sure what,

112
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,466
I didn't know that.

175
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:51,556
So that's it, then.

187
00:12:18,646 --> 00:12:19,695
Yeah, you're right.

277
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:23,284
So what now? Oreki?

283
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,221
We have an opening.

327
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,419
To conserve energy.

390
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,179
It was there, okay?

414
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,655
What issue is that?

469
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:25,566
Bad news, you guys.

56
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,701
I just want answers.

296
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:21,124
You won't have to...

328
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:49,797
What does that mean?

338
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:15,451
Yep. There they are.

381
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,987
He couldn't risk it.

388
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:31,175
What... lock... er?!

459
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:56,766
You think I'm wrong?

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,041
Okay. The truth is...

172
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:44,690
Really? Are you sure?

197
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:39,262
I don't get "pumped."

246
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:04,732
Oh well, that's that.

253
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:16,413
You don't understand!

301
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,595
Just get out of here!

308
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,031
Do you understand me?

315
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,029
I didn't do anything!

329
00:18:50,091 --> 00:18:51,394
So tell me something.

352
00:19:56,042 --> 00:19:57,115
Yeah, that was weird.

395
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:55,033
You really are weird.

408
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:25,820
It's what they had...

449
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,440
Why can't I remember?

206
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,970
Hey, sorry about that.

346
00:19:41,662 --> 00:19:42,829
Can you keep a secret?

362
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,631
Wait! Slow down a sec.

374
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:52,784
To get rid of a smell?

399
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:03,613
Look! I'm a sunflower!

5
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:35,373
Here goes! I need help!

50
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:21,841
I guess I was in shock.

75
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,161
You can do this, Oreki!

86
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,890
She's gotta be kidding.

144
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,819
Midterm tests are over.

165
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,524
It shouldn't be locked.

208
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:33,367
So what brings ya here?

336
00:19:08,054 --> 00:19:09,698
It's been five minutes.

337
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,979
We should get back now.

382
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,563
It all makes sense now.

385
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,154
That's not all, though.

136
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:28,071
Take exams, for example.

147
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:32,834
Greetings from Istanbul!

196
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:37,689
Admit it. You're pumped.

258
00:15:24,295 --> 00:15:25,424
I can't let that happen.

108
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,220
I thought he was missing.

168
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:33,858
A chemical locker, huh...

177
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,519
It isn't in here, though.

342
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,861
What on Earth did you do?

6
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,232
I have a favor to ask you!

91
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,853
Maybe you haven't noticed,

154
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,619
Have any more members yet?

188
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,276
And more than once, maybe.

207
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:31,832
I guess I locked the door.

250
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:12,012
Then don't just walk away!

281
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:43,426
Some cardboard boxes, huh?

331
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:55,366
Why are they so prominent?

373
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,631
Why take such precautions?

402
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:11,099
What? Oh, the anthologies.

422
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:51,784
What was special about it?

28
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,945
When I was in kindergarten,

57
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,481
And I've tried to get them.

204
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:16,261
Huh... I guess it's locked.

213
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,460
What's that smell? Cologne?

229
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,966
Anyway... What do you need?

255
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:20,289
It's the only clue we have.

299
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,530
Don't you get it? I'm busy!

456
00:24:48,472 --> 00:24:49,862
Isn't that what people say?

151
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,408
"This has been a lot of fun,

179
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,699
So... What happened to them?

191
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,281
I already asked the adviser.

194
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:34,571
Just trying to be efficient.

252
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,276
Hope you find 'em somewhere.

270
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,438
Where are the other members?

313
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:06,657
The door should be unlocked.

405
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,654
What is it? Something wrong?

452
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,607
Just look into it some more.

458
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,951
Is that what you want to do?

222
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,859
The Manninbashi home, was it?

291
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,386
You're cool with that, right?

353
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:58,633
Then there's the room itself.

387
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:27,362
Inside the locker, obviously.

419
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:45,007
That's what started all this.

156
00:10:55,887 --> 00:10:57,591
I wanted to ask you something.

219
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,463
I'm sorry, have we met before?

251
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:14,046
Anyway, sorry I couldn't help.

268
00:15:46,548 --> 00:15:48,057
Go ahead and take a look then.

276
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:18,596
Sorry. I guess you were right.

341
00:19:31,667 --> 00:19:33,105
How'd you know they'd be here?

375
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,887
Seems like a reasonable guess.

389
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:32,995
Hey. I'm not messing with you.

436
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,279
Details blur, facts fade away,

55
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,706
I still have so many questions.

82
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,429
This is a big deal to Chitanda.

116
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,821
That's why I'm in such a hurry!

205
00:13:19,263 --> 00:13:22,099
Excuse me! Is anybody in there?

271
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,624
Oh, they're takin' the day off.

228
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,271
What is this guy babbling about?

350
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:50,210
So let's start at the beginning.

418
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,496
I saw it back when I was little.

424
00:22:57,694 --> 00:22:59,863
Something happened 45 years ago.

431
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,865
The sacrifices that were made...

23
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,982
And he's been missing ever since.

92
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:33,769
but I'm kind of a private person.

169
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:36,997
You've got some good timing, Sis.

176
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:53,456
We just find the chemical locker.

434
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:32,738
Perhaps they should be forgotten.

2
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:21,727
Could I get another cup of coffee?

14
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:02,886
Well... I guess I can manage that.

51
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,534
Then, when I was in middle school,

126
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,546
I'll be sure to tell you about it.

128
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:55,576
I'm willing to listen to that too.

162
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,278
You have to look in the club room.

215
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:51,095
So... What can I do for you today?

394
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:48,701
he panicked and flipped out on us.

430
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,577
The struggles that were endured...

433
00:23:27,527 --> 00:23:30,411
And... Perhaps it is for the best.

19
00:02:54,613 --> 00:02:56,697
Yeah, I'm not really following you.

66
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,063
I asked around in the faculty room,

71
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:34,204
You think about things differently.

124
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:46,095
But I will keep your story in mind.

209
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:34,965
Wanna join the Wall Newspaper Club?

227
00:14:21,283 --> 00:14:23,501
That's cool. And you're a Chitanda.

274
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:13,657
We're about to hit our 500th issue.

440
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:54,430
October 13th, 1968. Yoko Koriyama."

457
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,419
So you're just gonna give up, then?

87
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:18,654
I still don't get why you picked me.

318
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:22,816
If I find them, that's what I'll do.

470
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,877
We're still missing the first issue!

54
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,877
Why didn't he react when I was upset?

93
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:36,374
I don't talk about my past very much.

131
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,770
I'll take whatever help you can give!

132
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:09,732
Thank you! I mean it; thanks so much!

135
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:25,950
There's also a good amount of tedium.

244
00:15:00,015 --> 00:15:01,970
I already told you, they aren't here.

259
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,354
We need a couple minutes, that's all.

260
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,190
Can't you at least give us that much?

266
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:42,234
Classic Lit Club member Ibara Mayaka.

368
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,720
And since when are you so tech-savvy?

404
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:17,693
Check out the ones from 40 years ago.

421
00:22:47,884 --> 00:22:50,137
and asking him about what was inside.

423
00:22:55,462 --> 00:22:57,440
Here, take a look at it for yourself.

432
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,289
Even his smile... All are fading now.

438
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,486
Bit by bit, the truth will be eroded.

447
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,904
I still don't know all of it, though.

30
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,365
That's when I became interested in it.

35
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:43,292
And for the first time I can remember,

74
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,744
And that secret club recruitment note!

157
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,035
Are you planning to make an anthology?

275
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,825
I'm not seeing what we're looking for.

326
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,477
Why are we waiting out here like this?

372
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,621
so he could start airing out the room?

403
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:15,277
Huh... So this is what they look like.

462
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:04,345
"Bit by bit, the truth will be eroded.

36
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,506
he was reluctant to answer my question.

100
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,610
Even if you aren't quite as personable.

242
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,648
Can't we just take a quick look around?

442
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,890
There's no way it's just a coincidence.

445
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,566
It must be what my uncle told me about.

464
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:11,184
How long till the truth's lost forever?

78
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,855
You're really giving me too much credit.

101
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,812
Well, that's one way to ask for a favor.

118
00:08:05,549 --> 00:08:08,462
Before I say goodbye. For the last time.

150
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,520
What trouble did you get into this time?

153
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,845
"I'm dying to know how the club's going.

192
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,672
It was located in the biology prep room.

226
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,878
So... President of the Classic Lit Club.

248
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,529
Don't you think he's acting kinda weird?

269
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,417
But don't make too much of a mess, okay?

73
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,441
Like with the lock. And the library book.

289
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,637
We could really use a few reinforcements.

322
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,731
I don't think I ever did catch your name.

102
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:18,281
I see something of him when I look at you.

183
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:09,438
Chitanda. Take a look at the letter again.

193
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,945
Wow. You're unusually well prepared today.

239
00:14:49,512 --> 00:14:52,412
Too bad. I guess we'll be on our way then.

383
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,772
Of course, if Chitanda didn't have a cold,

420
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,679
I remember taking this volume to my uncle,

435
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,267
After all, it was in no way a heroic tale.

443
00:24:01,915 --> 00:24:04,401
The Sekitani they talk about was my uncle.

79
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:53,119
That other stuff was just luck, that's all.

163
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:20,074
There's an unused chemical locker in there.

164
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,790
And the back-number anthologies are inside.

167
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,507
Take care of yourself. Your sister, Tomoe."

263
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,837
It's not just a clubroom, it's a classroom.

285
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:56,011
But with just the right amount of pressure.

343
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,561
Oh, just a little intimidation, that's all.

428
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:14,595
It has been a year now since Sekitani left.

20
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,337
I'm sorry. I'm telling this story all wrong.

53
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:29,081
What made my uncle so hesitant to answer me?

155
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,862
The club is actually the reason I'm writing.

200
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,133
Oh, hey, where's Fukube? I haven't seen him.

220
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,720
I saw you at the Manninbashi home last year.

225
00:14:14,697 --> 00:14:17,692
Yes! Thank you for all you do for my father.

284
00:16:49,464 --> 00:16:52,777
This situation has to be handled delicately.

348
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,381
If you tell me not to say anything, I won't.

386
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:25,366
Where did the anthologies end up being, huh?

38
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,737
Well... I threw a huge tantrum, to be honest.

80
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,471
I don't care if it's just luck; I'll take it!

121
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,677
It's not like you have anything better to do.

134
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,528
Of course, high school isn't all about drama.

221
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,039
I kind of have a knack for remembering names.

330
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:53,888
You've obviously heard of the Togaito family.

439
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,496
Until the tale is just another dusty classic.

461
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,374
I mean, look at what it says at the end here.

21
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,916
I guess I'm just not used to talking about it.

139
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,572
Obviously, that includes the Classic Lit Club.

190
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:25,359
How do we find out where it was two years ago?

218
00:13:58,242 --> 00:14:01,179
You're in class 3-E, right? Togaito, isn't it?

324
00:18:37,824 --> 00:18:40,191
For what it's worth, I'm sorry about all this.

463
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,179
Until the tale is just another dusty classic."

18
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:54,329
And I want you to help me remember what it was.

40
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,365
But when he told me what I wanted to know, I...

83
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,973
She's spent years obsessing over this question.

288
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,287
It's gonna take forever to sort through it all.

472
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,904
"The Classic Lit Club's Glorious Days of Yore."

24
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:11,997
I was very fond of him when I was a little girl.

48
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,209
He didn't do anything to comfort or reassure me.

58
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,470
We've become estranged from the Sekitani family,

117
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,370
I want to know the truth about our conversation.

178
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:59,532
Yeah, you're right, I don't remember seeing one.

181
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,704
It's all right, Chi. Let's just calm down a sec.

272
00:16:05,862 --> 00:16:08,435
I'm just brainstorming ideas for the June issue.

355
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:04,282
If you recall, it was pointed toward the window,

407
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:24,725
More precisely, it's called mimeograph printing.

103
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,040
And that makes me think I can trust you, somehow.

148
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,739
Or, more accurately, from the Japanese consulate.

185
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:15,515
My sister graduated from Kami High two years ago.

186
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:18,429
They've probably changed the clubroom since then.

198
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,999
That kind of excitement requires too much energy.

237
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,126
Are the anthologies in there? Have you seen them?

354
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,970
The window was wide open and the fan was running.

356
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:06,340
blowing around the papers that were on the table.

446
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,083
Well then the mystery's just about solved, right?

174
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,330
Here you go. Take a look for yourself if you want.

287
00:16:57,227 --> 00:16:59,512
I didn't realize how much stuff there was in here.

397
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,012
I'm probably the most ordinary guy at this school.

426
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,591
but it involved my uncle and the Classic Lit Club.

468
00:25:22,285 --> 00:25:24,191
So you just find issue one, and there you have it.

60
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,377
No matter what I do, I can't remember what he said!

159
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,776
You are going to keep up the tradition, aren't you?

166
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:28,004
Anyway, once I reach Pristina I'll give you a call.

370
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,021
I just infer stuff from what I observe, that's all.

29
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,262
I learned that my uncle was in the Classic Lit Club.

89
00:06:22,254 --> 00:06:24,669
Strength in numbers might be your best bet, ya know.

254
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:18,883
The information we've gathered points straight here.

264
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,222
There are non-members in there all the time, y'know.

406
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,519
That's because they were printed on a Ditto machine.

466
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,819
Besides, looking into it shouldn't be too difficult.

107
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,882
Not if I want all of this settled before his funeral.

111
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:46,186
it's possible to have them declared legally deceased.

233
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:36,657
This used to be the Classic Lit Club room, didn't it?

306
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,137
Yep. Our intel says that's where the anthologies are.

357
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,239
It's like he wanted to air out the room or something.

437
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:43,585
the passage of time polishes the story's rough edges.

27
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:21,538
It seemed to me that there was nothing he didn't know.

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,429
If anyone can help me find the answers I'm looking for,

232
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:33,582
and we're pretty sure they're in the Biology Prep room.

235
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,570
I think it was, actually, back when I was a first-year.

39
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,925
And I did convince him to answer my question eventually.

69
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,493
I still don't get why you're asking me for help, though.

96
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:01,543
I know I'm asking a lot of you, and maybe it's not fair.

99
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:11,783
You answer all my questions, just like my uncle used to.

290
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:07,595
I think I'll go and ask the club adviser to help us out.

455
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:48,115
There are some truths that are better left undiscovered.

59
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,105
and I haven't been able to get in touch with them at all.

241
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:56,558
Sorry to bug you, but we're pretty sure they're in there.

311
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,897
but if you happen to find the anthologies after we leave,

52
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,130
I started wondering about that strange conversation again.

363
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,435
Infrared sensors? What in the world are you talking about?

401
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:08,362
While you were out doing arts and crafts, we were working.

43
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:04,532
I don't know if it was because
I was scared or sad or what,

427
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,774
"Once again, the time for the
cultural festival is upon us.

450
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:23,469
What did my uncle say to me
that day that upset me so much?

453
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:39,517
But... It says there it might
be best if it were forgotten.

63
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,902
So that's the "personal matter"
you're always talking about?

106
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:33,195
I really don't think I'll have
anywhere near that much time.

152
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:48,120
and I know I'll look back in
10 years and be glad I did it."

125
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,925
And if I come across anything
that might give you some clues,

138
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:36,504
During the testing period, all
club activities are suspended.

184
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:12,234
All it said was they're in a
chemical locker in the clubroom.

295
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:20,377
We'll put everything back right
where we found it, I promise.

307
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:51,909
We don't care about anything
else that might be in this room.

454
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:43,975
Who knows, maybe something bad
will happen if I keep digging.

94
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:41,608
This story... isn't the kind
of thing I can tell just anybody.

114
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:58,403
I heard that they also intend
to hold a small funeral service.

211
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,280
Sorry. I didn't realize this
was the Wall Newspaper Club room.

262
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:33,342
I don't like the idea of letting
non-club members poke around.

280
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,695
Now that you mention it, we
did take some cardboard boxes out.

293
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:13,987
Like I told you, I don't want
you making a mess of this place.

294
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,382
Sorry we're inconveniencing
you, but this is really important!

333
00:18:57,225 --> 00:19:00,308
I guess they're best known for
their involvement in education.

149
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:39,231
I goofed up a bit and haven't
quite made it into the city yet."

310
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,068
Right now, we've got some stuff
to take care of in the library,

359
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:13,220
But why'd he care so much about
ventilating the room like that?

127
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,884
And if you find out anything
new that you want me to know about,

224
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:14,633
You wouldn't happen to be one
of the Kanda Chitandas, would you?

391
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:37,679
The chemical locker had to be
hidden under that makeshift table.

451
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,535
What exactly happened to him at
this school all those years ago?

312
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:05,179
maybe you could leave them in
the Earth Science prep room for us?

379
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:08,992
Knowing that the Togaito family
is prominent in academic circles,

122
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:39,167
This is not really the kinda
thing that I want responsibility for.

429
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:18,900
And in that year, he has gone
from being a hero to being a legend.

441
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:59,569
You see? Whatever event they're
referencing happened 45 years ago.

13
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:57,245
I know it's asking a lot, but
will you please at least hear me out?

141
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,723
Keys to the clubrooms aren't given
out while midterms are underway,

161
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:15,376
I'll tell you right now, the old
anthologies aren't in the library.

256
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:23,126
If they aren't here, we're going
to have to search the whole school!

444
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,487
This mentions struggles and
sacrifices, like something big happened.

61
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:06,849
So when I started at Kami High, I
signed up for the Classic Lit Club.

88
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,517
There's gotta be some other people
who can help you with this, right?

130
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:01,804
If you're good with those parameters,
then I guess I'll help you out.

376
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,419
And let's not forget the fact that
the place reeked of air freshener.

17
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:51,811
See, he told me something once...
Something that was really important.

217
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,071
My name's Eru Chitanda, and I'm
the president of the Classic Lit Club.

392
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:41,599
My guess is that Togaito kept his
cigarettes and lighter in there too.

393
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,477
So, when I suggested we come back
and search the room with an adviser,

84
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:08,304
There's no telling how much learning
the answer to it might affect her.

85
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,280
And she's asking someone like me to
take on a responsibility like that?

142
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:51,229
so even if we wanted to meet up
like usual, that wouldn't be an option.

16
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:47,099
So, the favor I wanted to ask you
has to do with my uncle, Jun Sekitani.

62
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,107
I figured it would be my last chance
to get to the bottom of everything.

231
00:14:27,871 --> 00:14:31,023
We're looking for the old anthologies
the Classic Lit Club put together,

361
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:17,803
why would he lock himself in and
place infrared sensors out in the hall?

202
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:56,583
He said something about getting a
head start on the summer fashion scene.

273
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,924
Our club's been writing the Kami
High Monthly Newsletter for a long time.

365
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:27,194
You didn't notice the small, strange
boxes on either side of the hallway?

334
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,384
Their family holds a lot of important
positions in the educational system.

65
00:05:15,622 --> 00:05:18,924
Of course, I had no way of knowing
that the club was about to be shut down.

137
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:33,045
It's every student's favorite time of
year here at Kamiyama High: Midterms.

11
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:49,991
It's a personal matter and not really
something I would normally talk about,

158
00:11:01,054 --> 00:11:05,137
The Classic Lit Club enters an anthology
each year for the cultural festival.

410
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:30,102
Copy machines didn't become commonplace
until a lot later, so they wouldn't...

22
00:03:02,813 --> 00:03:06,573
The first thing you should know is that
my uncle went to India seven years ago.

49
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:20,137
Afterwards, I couldn't remember what my
uncle had said, only my reaction to it.

67
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:25,462
but there weren't any teachers who
remembered a Jun Sekitani from 45 years ago.

72
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:37,946
You have this way of reaching conclusions
that would have never occurred to me.

467
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:22,260
This is Issue 2, and it talks about
stuff that happened the year before, right?

34
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:40,254
One day I asked my uncle about something
having to do with the Classic Lit Club.

90
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,372
Ask a bunch of your friends to help,
and I'm sure you'll get it done in no time.

140
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:43,537
But we don't really do anything anyway,
so there's honestly not much difference.

12
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:53,275
but I've given it a lot of thought and
decided that you might be able to help me.

384
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:21,410
she would've noticed the smell immediately
and things would've been a lot easier.

123
00:08:39,844 --> 00:08:43,602
So I wanna be totally clear that I'm not
agreeing to see this all the way through.

304
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:44,800
we're pretty sure what we're looking for
is inside some kind of a chemical locker.

366
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:31,270
Then there was that device with the
antenna on it that was obviously the receiver.

46
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:11,307
The sound must've startled my mom because
she came rushing in to see if I was okay,

97
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,428
I realize I probably shouldn't be dragging
you into my own personal drama like this.

367
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:36,219
He must've set it up so that anyone who
passed by the sensors would trigger an alarm.

31
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:33,193
I especially liked it because the name
reminded me of the vinegar kelp we ate at home.

105
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:27,403
You've got three whole years of high school
to spend looking for an answer, don't you?

279
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:34,264
When this became your clubroom, did you
move anything out to make space for your stuff?

371
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,898
The question is, why would he need an alarm
that would tell him when someone was coming

110
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:43,078
But if someone's been missing for seven
years and no one knows if they're alive or dead,

113
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:54,290
Declaring him dead would put the matter to
rest and give my uncle's family some closure.

160
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,824
If so, I'm sure you'll want to look at some
examples to know what you're supposed to do.

25
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:16,930
Unlike most other adults, he would answer all
my questions no matter how silly they seemed.

380
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:12,814
can you imagine the kind of trouble he would
be in if he was caught doing something illegal?

300
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:33,012
I don't want a bunch of underclassmen ransacking
my club room! Is that so hard to understand?

351
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:55,892
When Togaito came to meet us, he stepped out and
closed the door behind him instead of letting us in.

377
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,137
Now... What smell could he be trying to get rid of
that would make him go to such desperate measures?
