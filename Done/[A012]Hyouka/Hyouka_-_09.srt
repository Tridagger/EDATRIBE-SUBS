103
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,420
Hm.

269
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:04,389
Oh.

293
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:20,247
Oh.

478
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:13,438
Hm?

523
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:12,619
Oh.

540
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:02,872
Mm.

88
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:17,361
Huh?

195
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,922
I...

201
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:57,515
Huh?

461
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:31,079
Huh?

466
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,539
Huh?

474
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:04,939
Huh?

4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:13,865
Sure!

26
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:27,357
Sure.

28
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,795
Here.

33
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:44,881
Phew!

65
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,259
Ahem.

81
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:55,268
Ahem!

87
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,462
Uh...

95
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:31,692
Yeah.

114
00:06:11,795 --> 00:06:12,468
Yeah.

152
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:51,823
Boom!

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,110
Uh...

182
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,580
Ha...

198
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:51,833
Yeah.

199
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,139
Well,

208
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:14,549
Hmph.

209
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,216
Uh...

254
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:17,724
Uh...

274
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:22,185
Yeah.

295
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,084
Ahem.

390
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:38,266
Whoa!

396
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:52,916
Uh...

437
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,567
Ciao!

534
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,377
Uh...

542
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:05,772
Yeah.

186
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:25,878
Huh...

233
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:21,110
Dunno.

252
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,146
Right?

507
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:34,871
Hello?

541
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:04,771
Later.

548
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:27,843
Hello.

161
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,564
Well...

378
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,029
Well...

493
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:53,983
I know!

117
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:18,378
Hold on.

228
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:06,379
Uh, why?

383
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,533
I dunno.

404
00:19:07,838 --> 00:19:08,609
Why not?

545
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:18,804
Totally.

270
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,855
You know,

363
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,106
You know.

421
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:01,743
Rejected.

472
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,027
Um, what?

503
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:24,355
You okay?

521
00:24:08,402 --> 00:24:09,013
You know.

527
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:23,742
I buy it.

217
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:37,914
Good call.

267
00:12:57,045 --> 00:12:57,858
Hey there.

306
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:53,138
Now, then.

341
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:29,869
Some rope?

422
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:02,703
Very well.

469
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,128
So anyway.

515
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,870
Like what?

550
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,793
Next time:

13
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:27,848
Ciao, ciao!

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,904
Yeah. Sure.

67
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,850
Uh... Sure.

104
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:52,422
Okay, then.

113
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:11,711
The window?

135
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,378
Well, uh...

141
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:27,584
She saw it.

146
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,211
Is that so?

260
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:38,137
What is it?

284
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:51,502
What is it?

298
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:30,052
Is that so?

336
00:16:19,253 --> 00:16:20,003
Well, gosh.

345
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:43,645
Just think:

364
00:17:35,356 --> 00:17:36,050
What is it?

373
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:55,753
Not really.

400
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,745
Why's that?

455
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,695
All righty.

191
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,586
Well, Oreki?

427
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:16,311
Tipsy, much?

93
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,483
"On the fly"?

205
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:07,483
Say what now?

291
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,686
What is this?

352
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:05,763
Let me think.

30
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,585
What are they?

34
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,026
That's strong!

70
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:26,036
Well, maybe...

133
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,774
Oh. I'm sorry.

134
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,678
I just mean...

256
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:25,894
Yeah. I guess.

397
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:55,793
Haba's theory!

151
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:49,910
Mystery solved.

153
00:07:52,207 --> 00:07:53,619
Really? "Boom"?

289
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:13,025
Well, anyway...

439
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:42,420
I mean, "ciao"!

479
00:22:14,045 --> 00:22:15,424
Phantom killer?

531
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,147
Rejected again.

92
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:28,077
Even on the fly.

235
00:11:23,502 --> 00:11:24,613
And you, Mayaka?

280
00:13:38,878 --> 00:13:39,920
See what I mean?

333
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,004
But not for you.

340
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:29,003
This is the key.

513
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:51,836
I'll bet you do.

10
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:24,177
The props master.

11
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:25,623
Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,253
Of course it was!

75
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:40,128
No, none of them.

159
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,651
What do you mean?

176
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,581
Don't you get it?

220
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,113
I get your point.

223
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:52,890
You may be right.

324
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,733
A good deduction.

369
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:49,753
Yeah, 'bout what?

374
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:56,961
How could it not?

436
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,716
Sorry, am I late?

454
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,250
Great, thank you!

505
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:29,057
What do you mean?

21
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:15,765
Hope it goes well.

111
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,583
Sure. It's simple.

137
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,956
How do you figure?

190
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:35,085
Feasible and lame.

237
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:29,420
The classics, huh?

239
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,756
I don't read them.

337
00:16:20,086 --> 00:16:21,045
I just don't know.

488
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:40,503
Good story, right?

509
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:44,122
I have to admit...

12
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:26,967
Finally, we have...

80
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,620
More than anything.

112
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:10,846
Through the window.

435
00:20:33,086 --> 00:20:34,500
Sawakiguchi, right?

484
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,576
As for the title...

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,135
So, what's the deal?

27
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:29,866
Oh, I almost forgot!

144
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,442
I think it was June.

194
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:44,515
I wouldn't say that.

301
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:39,704
Why do you say that?

370
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,081
That guy's attitude.

426
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,074
Can I have one, too?

429
00:20:17,944 --> 00:20:19,556
Come on. Let us see.

444
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:55,205
I've been wondering.

546
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:20,628
Yeah, I know, right?

551
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,865
"Blind Spot to All."

7
00:00:17,503 --> 00:00:19,045
This is Junya Nakajo.

78
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,143
Well. Questions over?

107
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,244
A locked-room murder.

185
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:24,203
Thanks! See ya later!

187
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,295
You think he's right?

425
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:12,900
Hey, that looks cool!

506
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:32,751
Hey! Can you hear me?

508
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:39,942
I think she's asleep.

533
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,770
I'm sorry about this.

77
00:04:44,946 --> 00:04:46,472
Significant, like how?

147
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,892
So there ya go, right?

240
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,331
Seriously? Not at all?

448
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,046
Voted by the majority.

487
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:39,340
So, what do you think?

60
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,068
I mean, why would they?

123
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,744
In the stage left wing.

321
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,563
Can anyone tell us why?

354
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:09,045
"The Unseen Incursion."

395
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,803
Pretty great, actually.

399
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,836
No, I think he's wrong.

413
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,263
That would pretty dumb.

500
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:13,383
It's wrong. Just wrong!

519
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,064
One prop in particular.

35
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,018
Well, wanna get started?

63
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,127
I'm not being defensive.

129
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,688
So, as Nakajo suggested,

258
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,441
Very well. I understand.

259
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,945
There's one other thing.

327
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:57,730
So, other possibilities.

394
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,170
Oh, I feel totally fine.

420
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,519
How did it go this time?

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,895
And that's Tomohiro Haba.

16
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,696
This is gonna be awesome!

121
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:29,596
There. Let's take a look.

213
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,516
The window's here, right?

238
00:11:29,503 --> 00:11:31,016
What about you, Chitanda?

264
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,459
It may take me some time.

283
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,753
Hey, Oreki, look at this.

393
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,545
How are you feeling, Chi?

402
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:05,470
That part's solid enough.

428
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:17,880
I'm just fine, thank you.

20
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,603
Have fun! We'll talk soon!

149
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,304
No need for a door at all.

174
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,034
Yeah, I guess that's true.

255
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,299
Did the interview go well?

438
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:40,879
Hello, there, Sawakiguchi!

446
00:20:57,961 --> 00:20:59,868
Nope. She was recommended.

485
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:32,855
"Bloody Beast" would work.

14
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:30,835
Misaki Sawakiguchi. PR rep.

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,853
Oh, me? Ah. Well, you know.

263
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,795
I'll see if I can find one.

292
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,461
A floorplan from town hall.

323
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,584
and being seen by somebody.

368
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,769
That's it! Now I'm grouchy!

406
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:14,035
Oh. I see. The window, huh?

497
00:23:03,704 --> 00:23:05,413
Gettin' a little worked up.

538
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:58,586
Kinda depressing, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,642
He's our assistant director.

25
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,711
so thanks a lot for helping.

57
00:03:57,045 --> 00:03:58,080
Was it pretty well-received?

158
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:07,645
Okay then, who's the killer?

165
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,334
The grass was way overgrown.

175
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:53,485
Wait a sec! It's summer now!

202
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,975
Would you care to elaborate?

288
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:11,618
You really think that's all?

356
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,995
What other props were there?

362
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:34,399
If not, I'll just be goin...

431
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,542
She didn't skimp on details.

61
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,522
You sound a little defensive.

62
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:04,706
I'm sorry. Did I hit a nerve?

219
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,879
Well, that's my take, anyway.

458
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:25,336
Let's start with... this guy!

83
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,278
All they want is a good story.

99
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,125
I say play the title straight.

109
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,836
That's the real question here.

171
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:41,586
Now you're grasping at straws.

188
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:29,286
It's not much of a plot twist.

193
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:43,128
It doesn't sit right with you?

222
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,878
There's no way for us to know.

227
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,211
what kind does everybody read?

334
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,854
This is your specialty, right?

391
00:18:38,503 --> 00:18:40,833
Whoops! Did I eat all of them?

409
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,766
so it must've been shut tight.

434
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:33,061
There's still one person left.

447
00:20:59,988 --> 00:21:01,489
And making the film a mystery?

451
00:21:07,628 --> 00:21:09,627
I don't think so. I'm curious!

464
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,728
Except those are horror films.

490
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:45,170
So how did the killer get out?

31
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,381
Whiskey-filled chocolates, huh?

155
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:00,170
Why would it be "well-crafted"?

330
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:05,838
I'd say that's highly unlikely.

459
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,378
"Murder on the Orient Express"?

502
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,737
What's wrong is wrong. The end!

59
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,821
No one had any problems with it.

84
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,711
"That's him! He's the murderer!"

119
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,807
Satoshi, you have the floorplan?

172
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,295
Come on. Hongo wasn't a slacker.

338
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,187
The mystery expert doesn't know!

366
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:39,855
but have you seen the movie yet?

440
00:20:42,503 --> 00:20:43,993
I'd love to get this sorted out.

495
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,045
She's totally, completely wrong!

511
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,492
but I kinda liked that about it.

207
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,628
Every bit the cerebral detective.

361
00:17:31,795 --> 00:17:33,571
Now, will there be anything else?

430
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,327
Looks pretty well laid out to me.

452
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:11,277
Here, I have the meeting minutes.

465
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,014
Yeah, sure, I know what you mean.

483
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,368
And they share a kiss at sunrise.

491
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,767
Isn't it obvious? He's a phantom.

532
00:24:41,284 --> 00:24:43,628
Come on, Chi, let's get you home.

543
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,045
Oh, my god! I can't believe that!

122
00:06:31,836 --> 00:06:33,490
This is the room where Kaito died.

350
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:01,202
then escaped using the same route.

417
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,457
But we all saw the footage, right?

424
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,075
Thank you. This should be helpful.

530
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,422
What did you think of this theory?

50
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,971
Not very well from the sound of it.

145
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,350
No, maybe the end of May, actually.

232
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,336
Mm-hm. What kind do you read, then?

236
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,252
Old stuff. You know, like Christie.

389
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:37,342
You really put down a lot of those.

512
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,601
To be honest, I sorta like it, too.

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,169
And... You think you have an answer?

118
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,171
My memory's a little bit fuzzy here.

143
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:32,878
Do you know when she went to see it?

251
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:09,145
Very passionate. Seriously hardcore.

282
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:44,719
I suppose you could put it that way.

307
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,186
This is a locked-room murder, right?

353
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,545
I suppose I'd go with something like

365
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,253
This may seem like a silly question,

372
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,911
Didn't that bother you at all, Fuku?

433
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,336
Nakajo's theory is totally out then.

94
00:05:29,586 --> 00:05:30,878
You're saying the scene was adlibbed?

162
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:17,131
You didn't take into account the fact

211
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,564
Just that any killer with an instinct

257
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:30,677
We've rejected Nakajo's idea, though.

281
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:42,420
Obviously, Hongo was a total amateur.

294
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,258
We're interested to hear your theory.

329
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,963
Given the fact his arm was taken off,

385
00:18:22,228 --> 00:18:24,070
Just like with Nakajo's explanation--

501
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,902
Yeah, maybe. But can you disprove it?

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,717
I brought these for everyone to share.

42
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,635
Why do think they chose that location?

66
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:13,342
Let's move on to a different question.

97
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:36,024
Goin' on about the rules of a mystery.

125
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:41,295
Except initially, the door was locked.

168
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:33,226
That doesn't line up with your theory.

196
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,750
I'm not totally convinced, that's all.

234
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,245
Just the standard bestsellers, really.

367
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,525
Actually, I haven't had the chance to.

387
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:30,241
I don't know, maybe it's silly, but...

423
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,875
Here you are. I've brought the script.

449
00:21:03,378 --> 00:21:05,312
What about the idea to make a movie...

504
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:27,134
It's like looking into a kaleidoscope.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,818
Would you say it was a difficult shoot?

136
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,503
You're totally right, that's important.

276
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:27,586
Until she started working on this film,

379
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,086
It seemed like a pretty good one to me.

405
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,095
It's inconsistent with what was filmed.

510
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:46,783
Sawakiguchi's idea may have been crazy,

514
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:53,836
There are some inconsistencies, though.

516
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:57,333
We all saw how detailed the script was.

520
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:08,377
And what would this particular prop be?

1
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:05,628
Each of these three has their own theory

226
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:02,336
I'm curious. When it comes to mysteries,

486
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,989
Or whatever. That might be a bit cheesy.

15
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:33,213
Thanks for coming all the way to Class F!

96
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:33,853
Everybody got all fussy about it, though.

116
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,377
It's pretty obvious if ya think about it.

266
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,702
Tomohiro Haba. He's waiting just outside.

286
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:03,086
Here's another one. They're on here, too!

302
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:41,934
Heh... It couldn't have been pre-planned,

339
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,698
Well, I suppose I can't really blame you.

401
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,739
It's not the idea itself that's an issue.

6
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,273
You guys are mystery experts or somethin'?

19
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,120
All right then--we'll let you get started.

290
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,911
When are we gonna work on our own mystery?

410
00:19:23,086 --> 00:19:25,316
Plus, it creaked loudly and opened upward.

24
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:25,537
but without an ending, we're kinda screwed,

56
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,928
How did the crew feel about Hongo's script?

72
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:33,068
Which she could easily have said to anyone.

247
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:57,705
He may not wanna come right out and say it,

313
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,940
That is clearly an implausible explanation.

47
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:29,303
What's this got to do with anything, though?

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,587
She didn't make it out to the shoot, either.

189
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:33,253
It isn't fancy. But it is feasible at least.

221
00:10:47,138 --> 00:10:49,608
But did Hongo see the same problems you did?

371
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:53,290
I mean, he even made fun of Sherlock Holmes.

382
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:18,420
Unfortunately, I can't argue with it either.

415
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:41,174
Hongo had gone there to scope out the place.

215
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:33,545
There are other windows here, here, and here.

245
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,878
Okay, so what's your mystery genre of choice?

377
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,378
So, what do we think about Haba's conclusion?

384
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:22,045
I'm not completely convinced that he's right.

403
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,719
But it doesn't work in this particular movie.

453
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:13,144
If it'll help, you're welcome to take a look.

480
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:20,184
I'm not sure how many of them get killed off,

482
00:22:24,831 --> 00:22:27,232
Together, they're able to defeat the phantom.

535
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,828
Three possible endings, but none of 'em work.

105
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,384
Do you wanna tell us your theory of the crime?

197
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:51,193
In other words, it doesn't sit right with you.

308
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,270
All points of escape were effectively blocked,

450
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:07,338
I think we're getting a little off track here.

547
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,774
And I haven't even told you the best part yet.

139
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,906
If the story was based on the floor plan alone,

150
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,378
Just climb in, do the deed, and climb back out.

156
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:02,954
It's not like Hongo was an expert on mysteries.

244
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:50,378
That blows my mind. Didn't see that one coming.

249
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:02,615
What? I've never heard of a Sherlockian before.

489
00:22:40,586 --> 00:22:43,420
Except... The room where Kaito died was locked.

522
00:24:09,331 --> 00:24:11,581
The one Haba had the foresight to make lots of.

18
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:39,177
I'm kinda gettin' a weird vibe from these three.

23
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,766
The movie was a blast when we first started out,

224
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,210
But I do think if we can get our hands on a copy

261
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,353
You think you could get us a copy of the script?

304
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:47,420
The keys were spread out on the table, remember?

536
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:54,237
I wonder what's gonna happen to their movie now.

32
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:39,097
Promotional samples of a new product, apparently.

40
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:10,743
By bus and train, the trip was more than an hour.

45
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,322
but I'm surprised you were allowed to film there.

89
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,271
I think that's just the sort of satisfying ending

169
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,354
The killer couldn't have fled through the window.

355
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,445
All right. I'm ready to hear what you guys think.

460
00:21:27,588 --> 00:21:30,584
A boring old whodunit book? How lame can you get?

477
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:13,002
the phantom psycho killer appears out of nowhere!

537
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,945
Well, they won't be able to finish it, will they?

549
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,627
I wonder if you might have time for a cup of tea.

100
00:05:41,284 --> 00:05:44,330
"The Case of the Furuoka Deserted Village Murder."

173
00:08:44,378 --> 00:08:46,881
From what we've heard, her writing was consistent.

210
00:10:16,368 --> 00:10:19,179
Would you mind explaining what you meant, exactly?

248
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,248
but Fuku here fancies himself to be a Sherlockian.

297
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:29,170
Not if you're experienced with this sort of thing.

314
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,205
In order to get to the office where the keys were,

344
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:41,229
I'm sure you can see where this is leading, right?

524
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:15,752
Hongo only asked for a small amount of fake blood.

86
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,936
The mystery's solved, and everyone goes home happy.

102
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,649
I betcha Hongo knew that much about mystery flicks.

148
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:43,141
The killer came in and went out through the window.

456
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,436
Is everybody ready to listen to what I have to say?

462
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:33,191
Think about what you see if you're renting a movie.

115
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,211
The murderer kills Kaito then climbs out the window.

170
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,591
I dunno... maybe Hongo forgot to write that part in.

398
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:58,908
Oreki, do you think he's on the right track or what?

445
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,854
Did Hongo volunteer herself to write the screenplay?

471
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,883
So obviously, there must have been a seventh person.

525
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,468
The description in the script seems to back that up.

22
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:21,428
Sorry we got even more people dragged into this mess.

69
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:23,725
Hm... No, there's not really anything I can think of.

106
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,997
Given the way he died, you know what this was, right?

120
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,340
Yes, sir, I've got it right here as a matter of fact.

242
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,194
The truth is, I don't really care for mystery novels.

351
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:04,795
If I were going to decide on a title for the movie...

442
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,310
It's not like I can start making posters or anything.

528
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,690
Not much of a horror movie with only one dead person.

138
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,507
What if she wrote the script without seeing the place?

183
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,045
See? We solved it! The killer fled through the window.

184
00:09:19,128 --> 00:09:21,977
Now we can get back to shooting and finish this movie.

204
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,672
is made problematic itself by the psychology involved.

331
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:08,762
All in all, this could be a difficult murder to solve.

51
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,872
But honestly, I wasn't too surprised when she got sick.

265
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:49,891
While I'm looking, you can speak with our props master,

268
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,877
I understand the four of you know your mystery stories.

419
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:56,753
I can't believe I was so quick to buy that jerk's idea!

476
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,444
And right about the time their paranoia starts to peak,

73
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,907
So then, have you interviewed all the actors about this?

90
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:23,654
the audience would expect after the horrifying discovery

225
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:57,688
of the script, that would help us figure some stuff out.

494
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:57,779
It could be a vengeful spirit! Yeah! That's even better!

130
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,557
there were only two points of access to the murder scene.

200
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:56,505
I can definitely see flaws in Nakajo's version of events.

229
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,772
I got to thinking while we were listening to Nakajo talk.

335
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:19,096
What do you think the solution is to this murder mystery?

380
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,796
I'm not saying I like the guy, but there must be a reason

39
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,822
It was just getting out there that was a pain in the butt.

98
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:39,130
It's the drama of the story that matters, not the details!

157
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,951
It didn't really seem like she had anything fancy in mind.

167
00:08:28,445 --> 00:08:31,208
nothing looked like it was even a little bit out of place.

317
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:28,431
the building, so we can easily write-off that possibility.

44
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:22,565
I've heard about the deserted
village in the Narakubo area,

325
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:53,310
Plus, how could someone reach
that room and still have time

326
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,818
to re-enter from the correct
direction when they regrouped?

408
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,270
Katsuta gave it a good pull
and it still didn't wanna open,

475
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,830
Just think about it: they all
begin to suspect one another.

74
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:38,836
To see if Hongo said anything
to them that might be helpful?

468
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:49,914
They wouldn't draw a distinction
between mystery and horror.

41
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:13,673
I mean, would it have killed
them to choose someplace closer?

79
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,368
So maybe you'd like to hear my
theory about the murderer now?

181
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:13,193
neatly into place, top to
bottom! And there ya have it. Boom!

206
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,734
You think you could find a
more convoluted way of putting it?

243
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,781
I guess I've read enough of
them to know that much, at least.

278
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:35,215
Oh, the Nobuhara translation.
Looks like the latest editions.

285
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:54,831
There are some strange looking
marks here on this paper. See?

287
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,903
She probably just marked the
stories she wanted to draw from.

315
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,827
they would have to risk passing
through the front lobby here.

318
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,856
And the office isn't the only
area the killer couldn't reach.

91
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,720
of Kaito's body. Our props guy
did a great job with that scene.

131
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:04,498
The door everyone came in
through, and the window on this wall.

262
00:12:40,474 --> 00:12:43,326
We'd like to get a better feel
for Hongo's attention to detail.

347
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,287
Konosu was the one who went
upstairs to the right-hand hallway.

357
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:16,926
Did Hongo ask for anything
interesting besides the strong rope?

498
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:08,628
I agree, though, that sounds
more like a bad joke than a movie.

212
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:24,225
for self-preservation wouldn't
risk going in through the window.

418
00:19:47,836 --> 00:19:51,168
Obviously, the state of the
window wasn't a big concern for her.

529
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:29,994
It's starting to feel like we're
never going to figure this out.

154
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:57,822
That works, but it wouldn't make
for a very well-crafted mystery.

218
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,044
If I were the killer, that would
probably be the last way I'd go.

271
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,045
if you think of a mystery as a
contest between author and reader,

273
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,906
We heard that she didn't have a
lot of experience with the genre.

518
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:04,293
she would have arranged for the
necessary props, don't you think?

46
00:03:24,473 --> 00:03:27,460
The person who recommended it
had an in with the property manager.

178
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:01,128
Well, at that point in time, the
summer grass hadn't grown in yet!

275
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:25,499
She used those books to get ideas
for how to write the screenplay.

539
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,141
"Summer grass, 'tis all that
remains of ancient warriors' dreams."

101
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,150
Putting death right there in the
title is a good way to sell seats.

36
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,930
Why don't you give us your
perspective as a member of the film crew?

124
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:38,677
The other characters enter the
room here, through the right hallway.

303
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:44,920
since there was no way to guarantee
Kaito would end up in that room.

312
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,303
Could they have used the master
key and then replaced it afterwards?

332
00:16:09,003 --> 00:16:12,264
At least, for someone who doesn't
have experience with these things.

359
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:25,173
For example, the amount of blood
she asked for wasn't nearly enough.

376
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:04,111
And that's exactly what Hongo was,
so why shouldn't she start there?

381
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,839
Hongo asked for rope, and he makes
a solid case for his explanation.

414
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,603
That explains why you asked Haba
whether or not he'd seen the movie.

55
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,756
She worked that hard on the script
but then didn't come to the shoot?

127
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:50,626
Then they return, open the door,
and find Kaito dead inside the room.

272
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:17,585
an amateur writer like poor Hongo
is bound to come up a little short.

299
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,308
The first point I would make is
that the murder was not premeditated.

411
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,273
It would be impossible to open it
quietly while dangling from a rope.

473
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:03,960
Hongo was looking for another
actor, in addition to the original six.

499
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:11,572
But technically speaking, it would
fit with what's been filmed so far.

38
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:05,420
The performance and production side
of things was pretty fun, actually.

52
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,033
Why's that? Is she the type of
person who gets sick a lot or something?

126
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,961
So two of the characters head back
down the hall to get the master key.

407
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,775
It probably hadn't been opened in
years, since the place was abandoned.

43
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,640
I guess someone recommended it
because it had an interesting look to it.

250
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:06,126
From the name, I'd say it refers to
a passionate fan of Sherlock Holmes.

320
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:39,586
in which Kaito was found, but none
of the others could have accessed it.

441
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:47,362
There's not much I can do on the
publicity front till we've got a title.

82
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,247
If you ask me, your typical viewer
doesn't care about fancy plot devices.

279
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:38,630
She was teaching herself how to write
a mystery by reading Holmes novels?

388
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:33,650
I don't think that's what Hongo
intended when she was writing the script.

443
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,982
It's way past time we get this whole
script thing settled, if you ask me.

203
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:02,628
What seems like a simple solution to
the physical problem of a locked room

231
00:11:13,697 --> 00:11:17,836
Nakajo's idea of a mystery seems as
sophisticated as a kid's picture book.

296
00:14:23,187 --> 00:14:26,691
If you want my opinion, this mystery
is not especially difficult to solve.

386
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:27,819
I can't say what exactly, but something
about it feels a little off to me.

432
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:28,045
Look at this note: "Make sure there
are no footprints outside the window."

470
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,609
The problem is that no one could get
into the room where Kaito died, right?

2
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:08,986
about how the murder mystery is supposed
to play out in the finished script.

192
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:41,410
Do you think Nakajo's theory is in
line with what Hongo originally intended?

214
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,237
If you go in that way, you're practically
guaranteed to be seen by somebody.

140
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:26,628
she might have considered other escape
routes for the murderer to have taken.

142
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:31,312
Hongo went to visit the shoot location
before she started writing the script.

64
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:09,902
I'm just telling you that everyone
liked Hongo's script. And that includes me!

216
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:36,960
Walking around in broad daylight,
there's no way you're going to go unnoticed.

277
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,603
I don't think she'd seen any crime
shows or movies or read any mystery novels.

53
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:48,670
Yeah, she's been absent from school a
whole bunch of times throughout the year.

76
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:44,271
As assistant director, did you observe
anything else that might be significant?

375
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:00,671
I think Sherlock Holmes stories are
perfect for newcomers to the mystery genre.

492
00:22:48,714 --> 00:22:53,045
Phantom killers can walk through walls,
can't they? But if that doesn't work...

517
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:01,546
If Hongo had been planning that kind of
horror twist for the second half of it,

328
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:01,962
Perhaps Kaito's death could have been a
suicide disguised to look like a murder?

346
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:47,170
The killer couldn't enter from the first
floor, but what about the second floor?

49
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:37,017
Actually, if you don't mind me interrupting,
I'd love to know how Hongo is doing.

177
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:58,128
Remember how I said that Hongo went to
scout out the site back at the end of May?

342
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:34,231
I am the props master, remember? And
Hongo specifically asked me to procure this.

241
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:39,336
It's not that I've never read one, it's
just I haven't bothered to in a long time.

322
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,961
For the same reason you already gave.
They couldn't risk walking through the lobby

360
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:29,867
Fortunately, I had the foresight to
prepare extra so we would have plenty on hand.

496
00:23:00,154 --> 00:23:03,475
There's no way that's how Hongo meant
for it to end when she wrote the screenplay!

526
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:22,781
Knowing that, we can assume she wasn't
planning on a movie with a high body count.

544
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:14,367
No matter how much passion goes into a
film, without real skill, it feels amateur.

163
00:08:17,156 --> 00:08:20,895
that we get a look outside the window
after everyone arrives at the scene, did you?

230
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:13,586
He has his own idea of what a "mystery"
should look like, but what do we all think?

179
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:04,806
So she probably wouldn't have taken the
grass into account when she wrote the scene.

48
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:33,109
You never know what information might hold
an important clue. Please, let's continue.

71
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:31,146
It might not mean anything, but I remember
she made a point to wish Konosu good luck.

310
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:06,128
That tells us whoever killed Kaito could
not have escaped using conventional methods.

85
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,878
Once his guilt is revealed, the culprit
breaks down in tears and confesses his crimes.

305
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:51,271
Everybody picked one up at random, and
that's what decided where they went to explore.

319
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:35,778
The first-floor hallway down the right
side is the only open route leading to the room

358
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,311
No, she didn't have very many requests,
which I think speaks to her lack of experience.

457
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:22,378
First, I'd like to know what you picture in
your head when you hear the word "mystery."

348
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,086
Konosu is in the Mountaineering Club,
although you wouldn't know it from looking at her.

481
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,513
but I think the best bet is to have one
couple left alive, y'know, for a little romance.

166
00:08:24,461 --> 00:08:28,420
Anyone passing through it would have left a
pretty obvious trail, but from what I recall,

68
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:20,374
So did Hongo say anything to the actors about
which of them might be playing the murderer?

132
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,660
Except, that doesn't mean much of anything
if Hongo didn't know when she wrote the script.

467
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:45,567
Think about it from the perspective of someone
who's not all that interested in the genre.

3
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:13,302
I'd appreciate it if you'd listen to what
they have to say and then tell me what you think.

392
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:45,646
I couldn't decide if I liked them, so I kept
trying them to see if I could make up my mind.

160
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:13,601
Even if we say your theory about how it went
down is true, can you tell us who the killer is?

108
00:05:59,336 --> 00:06:04,124
Kaito was found in a room with only one door,
and it was locked. So, how'd the killer get out?

128
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,766
There were two other entry points, but they
were totally blocked with furniture and other junk.

180
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,461
All we have to do is cut the grass and re-shoot
the dead body scene, then everything should fall

316
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:25,588
That would put them in danger of being seen by
any of the other characters who were moving about

253
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:16,175
I don't know if that's really how I would describe
it. You might be oversimplifying a little bit.

300
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:38,603
Rather, circumstances simply fell neatly into
place, and the killer seized that opportunity to act.

311
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:10,332
And of course, let's not forget the question of
how the killer entered the room in the first place.

416
00:19:41,503 --> 00:19:45,710
If the window was such an important plot point,
she would've checked to see if it would open or not.

309
00:14:57,295 --> 00:15:01,920
aside from the window, and the ground outside of
that showed no sign of having been recently disturbed.

349
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:59,288
She dangled the rope out the second floor window,
climbed down it to the stage left wing, killed Kaito,

412
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:33,920
Do we really think Kaito would just stand there
doing nothing while somebody was rattling at the window?

343
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:38,679
She said we needed to find a rope that was strong
enough that it could support the full weight of a person.

463
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:38,171
It's all slasher flicks--the kinda stuff that's full
of blood and gore and chainsaws. You know what I mean?
