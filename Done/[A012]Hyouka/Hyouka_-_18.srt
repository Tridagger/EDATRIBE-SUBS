27
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:03,125
No.

46
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:48,939
Oh!

65
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,754
Oh!

325
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,311
Hm?

100
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,340
Huh?

138
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:04,549
I...

177
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:04,507
Yes?

250
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:15,487
Huh?

34
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:16,125
Okay.

187
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:25,369
Look!

207
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:49,905
Sure.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,109
Mm-hmm.

12
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:54,925
Mm-hmm.

102
00:06:02,104 --> 00:06:02,916
Mm-hmm.

140
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:12,343
Hotaro?

217
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,786
Eureka.

308
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:11,634
Rescue?

15
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:38,096
Ogi who?

70
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:44,291
Weird...

89
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,170
I'm not.

324
00:20:28,563 --> 00:20:29,366
Oreki...

366
00:22:52,265 --> 00:22:53,183
Oreki...

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,353
For real?

67
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,726
AGM, huh?

131
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:45,695
Gotta go.

176
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,283
Chitanda!

370
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,750
Oh, well.

103
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,836
Lightning!

153
00:08:40,313 --> 00:08:40,976
Hey, what?

155
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,393
Yes, I am.

342
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:30,739
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:36,063 --> 00:25:36,841
Next time:

152
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,229
Hey, Oreki!

211
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:02,909
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,367
Sure thing.

224
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,352
Yes, ma'am.

233
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,889
Hey, Oreki.

271
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,138
Here we go.

272
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:01,424
Okay, then.

327
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:38,328
Sure. What?

60
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,572
A formation.

274
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:05,984
Basically...

11
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,687
A helicopter?

134
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,644
Hotaro, wait.

136
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:01,297
You're wrong!

144
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,332
Knock it off!

200
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:17,402
It's nothing.

203
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:34,856
It's strange.

257
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,277
Let me see...

383
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,297
Then again...

51
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,477
That's better.

125
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,741
Wait a minute!

150
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,896
Ugh, whatever.

340
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:24,384
But not today.

362
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:41,640
I just mean...

385
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,808
I owe her one.

17
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:41,931
No. Who's that?

148
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:32,928
That's so rude.

212
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:04,275
Try "stranded."

1
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:08,731
No, I'm serious!

28
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:04,503
That's so weird.

50
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:56,336
Completely sure.

158
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,163
Now I'm curious!

195
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,350
had this to say:

205
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,662
Excuse me, Miss.

254
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,752
They're so cute!

288
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:00,734
And with that...

175
00:09:57,712 --> 00:10:00,004
Oh, okay. See ya.

236
00:14:14,382 --> 00:14:15,343
That sounds good.

266
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:17,921
Whoa. It's heavy.

307
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,683
A rescue mission.

311
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:20,961
Yeah, I remember.

13
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:00,849
That reminds me...

96
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:52,506
Fine, out with it.

112
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,144
That sounds awful.

186
00:11:21,971 --> 00:11:23,677
Oreki, you made it!

223
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,250
Hi, may I help you?

378
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:35,842
I'll see you later.

32
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:13,354
Did I just dream it?

133
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:53,353
You guys wanna come?

137
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:02,918
How should I put it?

305
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,162
But this one didn't.

374
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:19,418
You're very welcome.

53
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:00,682
That is pretty weird.

159
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:52,647
You're what? But why?

295
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,481
Mr. Ogi wasn't eager.

384
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,275
...this was my quest.

64
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,943
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

114
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, that's for sure.

116
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:50,249
Struck by lightning...

226
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,190
May, three years back.

357
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,876
People died, you know?

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,078
Really? That's amazing!

80
00:05:13,907 --> 00:05:15,449
It was three years ago,

173
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:55,703
Nope. Not that, either.

240
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,882
I've heard that theory.

285
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,500
Something like it, yes.

293
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,040
But... why would he be?

306
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,911
Then what did it carry?

372
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:15,661
Well, I gotta be going.

380
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:45,034
night will have fallen.

57
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:10,430
We'd all stop and watch.

270
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:50,011
If my theory is correct.

360
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:35,110
Was that hard to follow?

377
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:30,065
Oh! Sorry, you're right.

33
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,061
She can't not have known.

85
00:05:24,906 --> 00:05:26,364
Hey, speaking of Mr. Ogi,

117
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,402
And three times, to boot.

170
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:38,796
Why don't you ride ahead?

172
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,018
No way; that's not right.

263
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,660
So what did you find out?

49
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,120
Are you sure that was Ogi?

82
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:20,622
It was just that one time,

92
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,256
Hmph! This story's insane!

105
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:13,774
He was struck three times!

139
00:08:05,646 --> 00:08:07,250
I just have to know, okay?

168
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,395
Thanks for waiting for me!

169
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:32,854
Okay. Are you ready to go?

213
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,132
I've turned up 12 results.

230
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,097
Sure, we're happy to wait.

238
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,707
The cover is so beautiful!

54
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,541
You're right, it's unusual,

151
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,252
I'll wrap it up in no time.

227
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,556
I'll look for you; hold on.

313
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,098
Even while he was teaching,

330
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:49,189
Oh. You have a point there.

14
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,361
Wasn't Ogi into helicopters?

88
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:34,241
Don't start making stuff up.

156
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:46,196
You're going to investigate?

163
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:03,902
This is all incredibly rude.

234
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:11,396
Since we'll be here a while,

253
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:26,770
Dung beetles... interesting.

361
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,410
Insensitive's a strong word.

367
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,540
That's very... I don't know.

387
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,650
"Does Anyone Have Any Idea?"

21
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:50,258
Satoshi. Do you remember him?

40
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:32,599
But this time it was strange.

68
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,259
And what does that stand for?

97
00:05:53,218 --> 00:05:55,382
Well, according to Mr. Ogi...

174
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,518
No, you go on. I'll catch up.

198
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:11,274
I see. That's what I thought.

294
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,891
The stakes were high for him.

18
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:44,165
You know. Ogi. From Class 2-B.

52
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,298
I felt like I was going crazy.

90
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,973
I swear, it actually happened.

99
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,824
...he was struck by lightning!

242
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,191
Wow, that's pretty impressive.

245
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,664
Look at all of these cabbages!

302
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,354
The mountaineers in this town?

322
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,005
They didn't make it, it seems.

338
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,585
She's got it completely wrong!

349
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:54,335
So then I went to the library.

352
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,365
And you were there to help me.

369
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,859
What is she trying to tell me?

30
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:09,976
We all went to the same school,

36
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,338
No, it's not really a big deal.

73
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:52,784
I'm just saying he'd freak out.

267
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:31,329
There's a ton of stuff in here.

379
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:43,596
By the time Chitanda gets home,

48
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,380
Yeah, I remember that happening.

78
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:09,563
But like Fuku said a moment ago,

87
00:05:30,444 --> 00:05:32,421
The man is pretty much a legend.

154
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,693
You're just curious, aren't you?

255
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:34,485
Not quite how I'd describe them.

310
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,617
Too bad for a helicopter to fly.

368
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:05,596
I can't think of the right word.

22
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,696
I mean, sure, I remember Mr. Ogi.

98
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,400
...on three separate occasions...

130
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,161
They won't have what I need here.

214
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,703
Would you like to narrow it down?

219
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,715
Pardon... If you wouldn't mind...

248
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,124
They look so juicy and delicious!

346
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,851
Yeah, I remember you saying that.

355
00:22:17,194 --> 00:22:18,985
Maybe "mindful" is a better word.

132
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,313
I'm heading to the public library.

246
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:05,065
There are so many gorgeous colors!

258
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:49,476
Now, that is what I call a castle.

265
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,430
Thank you very much for your help.

72
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,163
A dance might be taking it too far.

76
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:03,239
Hmm... It's all coming back, right?

127
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,923
Yes, they do. Some of them, anyway.

165
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,791
He was really disappointed, though.

167
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:16,739
but I couldn't bring myself to ask.

231
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,020
I'll call you over when it's ready.

251
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:17,330
I can give you some, if you'd like!

280
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,892
You're right; that is pretty weird.

328
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:40,813
Why were you so curious about this?

376
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,288
Come on, don't say stuff like that!

24
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,924
I thought everybody knew about that.

26
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,683
Ibara, does any of this ring a bell?

59
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,539
Hold on a second. What's a squadron?

84
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,822
There's gotta be more to this story.

141
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,520
What have you done with our friend?!

199
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:16,123
Oreki, is there anything the matter?

208
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:51,596
What is it you'd like to search for?

228
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:55,022
Sure. Thank you so much for looking.

247
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,694
And this page with all the tomatoes!

273
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:03,847
What do you think all of this means?

281
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:34,586
But then it hit me, no pun intended.

303
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,402
They'd pay attention to helicopters.

354
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:13,150
What do you mean, "careful"? How so?

364
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:47,575
I'll probably never see Ogi again...

382
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,366
I didn't exactly ask her to help me.

37
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:23,271
Ibara, let me try to jog your memory.

39
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:29,816
Um, that happened like, all the time.

118
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,676
Is something like that even possible?

232
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:05,451
We truly appreciate your help, ma'am.

268
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,700
There! That's the issue from May 9th!

283
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,016
Like up in the mountains. Am I right?

55
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,670
but I swear it happened, nevertheless.

61
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,187
And how could you tell they were JSDF?

91
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:39,413
I heard this one from Mr. Ogi himself!

161
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:57,112
It's novel for you to be so intrigued!

210
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:58,915
Should I search for specific keywords?

221
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,494
Chitanda can tell where this is going.

277
00:17:19,753 --> 00:17:21,794
I think that part is most likely true.

319
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:56,298
...but I do remember seeing him smile.

332
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,306
Well, I guess you're right about that.

358
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:26,386
The way I spoke seems insensitive now.

31
00:03:10,122 --> 00:03:12,164
and Ibara and I were in the same class.

241
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,788
I'd like to read more about it, though.

318
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,863
I can't speak to what he was feeling...

323
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:12,905
They were found by a police helicopter.

16
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,868
Do you mean Takahiro Ogi from Class 2-B?

25
00:02:58,313 --> 00:02:59,979
It was the talk of the school for a bit.

104
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,684
Three times? How could that man be okay?

106
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:16,936
Three times? How could that man be okay?

191
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,884
"The Kamiyama Mountaineering Association

220
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,878
We'd like to see this newspaper article.

348
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,581
That's what motivated me to investigate.

19
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:45,904
No, this Ogi taught at our middle school.

147
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:31,854
I'm sure you'll be back to 100% tomorrow.

171
00:09:41,107 --> 00:09:43,032
I can give you a lift there, if you want.

222
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,323
Hey, Maruta, do you have a minute or two?

344
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,675
When Satoshi told us about the lightning,

3
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:13,998
their growth rate increased exponentially!

128
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,109
We have a few in the school library, also.

145
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:26,103
Oreki, you should go straight home to bed.

326
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:36,263
Would it be okay if I asked you something?

204
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,709
I'm kind of hoping my hunch gets disproven.

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,395
But he was struck by lightning three times.

279
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,771
Not someone likely to get hit by lightning.

321
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,813
The bodies of two climbers were discovered.

345
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:43,984
my mind associated it with something awful.

359
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:28,460
And that's what I have to be mindful about.

95
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm not saying it's impossible, but still...

129
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,590
But only ones that pertain to Kamiyama High.

194
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,262
The association's captain, Masakiyo Ogi, 39,

244
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:50,666
I've always wanted to take a trip to see it.

83
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:22,870
and the way he tried to cover was weird, too.

181
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,790
Sure, I'll get right on it. See you in a few.

218
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:30,057
There's an article from May 9th of that year.

252
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:21,340
Oh! Look, Oreki, I found the book on insects!

301
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:50,366
a string of many, 3000-meter-class mountains.

365
00:22:47,812 --> 00:22:50,126
So his feelings might not be of much concern.

275
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,234
Mr. Ogi wasn't especially fond of helicopters.

185
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:09,671
I shouldn't keep Chitanda waiting for too long.

235
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,254
would you like to look around for a little bit?

259
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:52,654
Your house is huge. Kind of like a castle, huh?

20
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,335
He was an English teacher, kind of an older guy.

43
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:43,104
then said something about how he loved choppers,

69
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,504
It's an abbreviation of "air-to-ground missile."

146
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,233
Make yourself some tea and pile on the blankets.

45
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,067
And then he just went back to teaching, remember?

143
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,217
Or have you been brainwashed by one Eru Chitanda?

188
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,571
I found some information on Mr. Ogi in the paper!

243
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:48,521
Miyajima, the island with the Itsukushima shrine.

260
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,751
Do you really think so? Our house isn't that big.

335
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,931
She didn't even bat an eye at my immutable motto.

343
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:34,601
It's strange, but I just have to know the answer.

10
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:33,215
That's fascinating, but we're here to do homework.

42
00:03:38,274 --> 00:03:40,693
He stared at this helicopter until it disappeared,

44
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:45,285
like he was trying to brush it off as no big deal.

94
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:48,709
So if you guys don't believe me, I don't blame ya!

101
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,021
You don't mean, like, lightning lightning, do you?

157
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:48,658
Yeah, but who knows if I'll even turn anything up.

206
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:49,173
I'd like to do a search of the newspaper archives.

35
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:19,566
Is this thing with Mr. Ogi worth examining further?

215
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,955
If that's all there are, I'd just like to see them.

111
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:31,675
and he has burn marks all over his entire body, too.

115
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:42,461
Even so, why didn't I ever notice any visible scars?

320
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,712
We combed the newspaper for several days after that.

75
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,507
I remember hearing that after starting middle school.

123
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:12,105
If Satoshi was telling the truth, could Ogi be lying?

286
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:55,189
I figured that even though he was an English teacher,

373
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,196
I really appreciate you helping me out today, though.

8
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:24,938
When they're stimulated by a strong current like that,

23
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:55,812
But I didn't know he was really that into helicopters.

284
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,299
So did you have a hunch that this would be the answer?

287
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,617
mountaineering could've still been his favorite hobby.

300
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,276
Kamiyama sits in the shadow of the Kamikakiuchi range,

315
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,226
If it cleared up, the helicopter would be able to fly,

334
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:03,871
Yeah, but that's not exactly what I was trying to say.

336
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:13,349
Oreki, you do work hard all the time for other people.

164
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:09,045
Satoshi couldn't come because he had too much homework.

160
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:55,271
Because something has the power to pique your curiosity!

331
00:20:49,322 --> 00:20:52,168
It just doesn't really seem like something you would do.

337
00:21:13,449 --> 00:21:16,026
You've stepped in to help me a lot since I've known you.

110
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,848
He told us he was knocked unconscious one of those times,

122
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,857
He even prefaced by saying it was unbelievable, but true.

124
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,980
It seems like one of those "stranger than fiction" cases.

237
00:14:23,418 --> 00:14:26,673
Oh, is this month's issue a special on Taira no Kiyomori?

291
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:11,156
Because that particular helicopter had a special purpose.

347
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:49,339
I wanted to find out whether I was right about it or not.

2
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:11,719
When we played classical music for our shiitake mushrooms,

47
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:51,646
Now that you've told me the story, it does sound familiar.

93
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:45,261
If I hadn't heard it firsthand, I wouldn't have bought it.

262
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,512
I wonder where she's getting her idea of a "normal house."

63
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,100
And are you positive Ogi was
around when all that happened?

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,610
I've suddenly remembered another
incredible story about him.

107
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,829
It looks like Chitanda's learned
to play along with Satoshi.

126
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,889
Satoshi. Don't they keep old
newspapers in the city library?

135
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:59,375
If I didn't know any better,
I would say you were motivated.

108
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,095
Although, apparently the
lightning didn't strike him dead on.

120
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,581
In spite of that, Ogi claims
to have been struck three times.

314
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,867
all he could think about was
the weather up in the mountains.

304
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:59,542
Even if they just carried aerial
photographers over the range.

317
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:43,358
Imagine what he felt. He must
have been going through so much.

363
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:45,113
That sense of not taking how
the other guy feels into account.

381
00:23:47,563 --> 00:23:50,452
But she's the one who offered
to tag along in the first place.

289
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:04,047
I decided to come to the library
and put my theory to the test.

109
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,993
But that still doesn't mean he
walked away completely unscathed.

202
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:26,379
Yes, but we can ask at the
information desk on the second floor.

296
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,601
He was desperate to know if the
copter was going to fly that day.

178
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,670
If you happen to come across the
news archives before I get there,

189
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:37,058
"Mountain trail beautification
efforts in the Kamikakiuchi Range."

74
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,798
Hmm... It's all coming back to
me. Ogi did go crazy for helicopters.

119
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:58,443
We haven't historically experienced
much lightning here in Kamiyama.

149
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:36,494
Is it that hard to believe I would
take some spontaneous initiative?

290
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,518
Why did he only look up at the
helicopter on that day and no others?

81
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:18,558
but I think I would remember if
Ogi had done something similar again.

180
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:14,987
I believe it's written out as,
"small tree that is correct and pure."

190
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:41,229
It seems like mountaineering is
one of Mr. Ogi's secret hobbies, huh?

201
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:21,684
Was this the only mention of him
you found in the newspaper archives?

261
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,413
I would say it's only a little bit
bigger than a normal house, right?

278
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:26,060
Although... He was really just
your typical Kamiyama English teacher.

316
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:38,497
and the chances of the stranded
mountaineers' survival would improve.

329
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:47,271
So, what, am I only allowed to
investigate when you guys are curious?

256
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,812
Well, Oreki, is there anything
around here that you'd like to look at?

312
00:19:21,882 --> 00:19:25,252
Ogi was worried the police wouldn't
be able to send it out on the 9th.

292
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:18,784
Mr. Ogi was especially eager to see
that lone helicopter doing its job.

333
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:58,079
I mean, after all, my motto is, "If
I don't have to, I'm not going to."

356
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,470
With all that happened, I shouldn't
talk about it as casually as I did.

162
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,604
I'm dying to know what quest could
have that kind of influence over you!

341
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:27,665
So I want to know what made you
investigate for your own sake this time.

353
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:09,606
If it turned out to be true, then I
should be more careful about things.

309
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:16,131
The article says that on May the
8th, the weather conditions were severe.

121
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,958
Satoshi isn't the type to lie to his
friends for the sake of a good story.

179
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,325
will you go ahead and start looking
through them for the name Masakiyo Ogi?

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,729
Even so, I don't remember Ogi having a
particularly strong reaction to those.

375
00:23:22,092 --> 00:23:26,006
Actually, I'm grateful to have the
opportunity to see this other side of you.

79
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:13,679
Ogi never freaked out about helicopters
after that one flew over during class.

371
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,643
If she can't find the words for it,
then I'm certainly not going to press her.

29
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:08,198
How could it have made such an impression
on me, yet they don't even recall it?

209
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:56,331
I'm interested in local happenings from
April and May of about three years ago.

229
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:59,597
It might take about a half-hour for me
to track down the article for you, okay?

225
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:49,546
We're interested in reading a particular
newspaper article from a few years ago.

193
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:53,655
Eleven volunteers took part, primarily
picking up litter and removing overgrowth.

166
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:14,692
Ibara would have been a lot of help since
she knows the ins and outs of libraries,

297
00:18:28,176 --> 00:18:31,948
That's why, when he heard the sound, he
ran over to the window to see what it was.

56
00:04:04,707 --> 00:04:09,033
But when the squadrons of JSDF helicopters
would fly over, it was an awesome sight.

77
00:05:03,354 --> 00:05:07,094
I even recall wondering if all the middle
school teachers were as weird as Mr. Ogi.

249
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:14,915
That reminds me, Oreki, we still have a
ton of shiitake mushrooms from the harvest!

264
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:12,813
It's contained in this compilation of
articles, so you can find what you need here.

66
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:36,529
It was in English class, 'cause I remember
looking up AGM in the English dictionary.

62
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:24,189
Because I don't know of any other groups
of helicopters that fly around in squadrons.

142
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:19,285
Are you the energy conservationist Hotaro
Oreki? Have you been possessed by an alien?

113
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:37,443
But he did live to tell the tale, so there
is that one consolation, at the very least.

351
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:02,631
But since it was just a matter of flipping
through old newspapers, it was no big deal.

71
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:48,861
I'd think if Ogi was into choppers and a
squadron flew over, he'd get up and do a dance.

269
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:48,338
When Ogi stopped class and voiced his love
for helicopters, it must have been on this day.

339
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:23,089
However, I've got to say, you're usually
complacent when it comes to working for yourself.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,271
Yeah, and if you expose them to electricity,
like artificial light, they'll get even bigger.

282
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:38,875
What if he frequently visited a place where
lightning struck a lot more than it does in town?

298
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:37,280
Just saying that an English teacher stops class
to watch a helicopter doesn't make much sense.

38
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:27,647
Now think... Do you happen to recall that day
when a helicopter flew over Kaburaya Middle School?

350
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:58,944
If all of the research required had been a major
undertaking, it would've been a different story.

192
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:49,070
began sponsoring beautification efforts on the
Abumidake mountain trail on the 26th of this month.

183
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:57,960
...in such ranges where the peaks are around
3,000 meters, the air currents from below get blocked.

196
00:11:58,582 --> 00:12:02,822
'The current climbing boom could bring with it
climbers who might not be familiar with trail etiquette.

299
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:43,161
But when you frame it as a mountaineer dropping
everything to watch one, then that's a different story.

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:30,315
they feel threatened, and the fungal filaments
respond by growing bigger to ensure reproductive success.

182
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:52,993
From what my sister has told me, having been up
into the Kamikakiuchi mountains herself several times...

41
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,690
Mr. Ogi stopped teaching in the middle of class and
ran over to the window to look at something in the sky.

239
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:35,436
The feature says that Taira no Kiyomori was actually
the child of someone in the Shirakawa palace, I think.

184
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:04,195
This can cause the weather to vary greatly from the
near to far sides, like two completely different climates.

197
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:07,850
I think it's important for them to know that a breach of
manners in this environment could cost them their lives.'"
