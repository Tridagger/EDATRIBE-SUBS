Oh.

152
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,900
Oh.

308
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:18,677
Hm?

55
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,335
Wow.

224
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,869
Yep!

228
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,045
Yes?

240
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:14,633
Yes!

287
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:24,563
Yes.

68
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:11,521

75
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:29,372

Well?

353
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,776
Yeah.

44
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,707
Later.

137
00:08:44,297 --> 00:08:45,033
Great!

Right!

3

Well...

You do?

45

Hi, Chi.

301
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:53,521
Nothing.

307
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:18,080

Now what?

268
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,540
I mean...

302
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,469
Oh, well.

351
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:41,916
Second...

Yo, Fukube!

8

Fine, then.

Well, then.

300
00:16:50,396 --> 00:16:51,108
'Bout what?

317
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:43,011
Well, uh...

18
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:37,100
Interesting.

46
00:04:14,369 --> 00:04:15,771
It's no use.

Pretty much.

00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,229
But I can't!

Damn it, Sis.

140

All right, Jumoji.

78
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:33,734

I kind of need it.

00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:12,479
Right. I remember.

How do we proceed?

19
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:50,985
She seems familiar.

95
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,781
least of all to me.

207
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,223

00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,396
This is incredible!

That's a mere blip.

354
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:47,435
You mean like this?

382
00:20:58,354 --> 00:20:59,386
Those come to mind.

Oh. It's about this!

251
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,137
Oh. I had to change.

277

I need it right now.

319
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,458
Yes, please tell us.

00:04:19,348 --> 00:04:20,667
How did you know that?

It was the same person!

Seriously, who is that?

266
00:15:26,813 --> 00:15:28,376

321
00:17:56,124 --> 00:17:58,040

Should I know who that is?

326
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:20,271
So... it's "obscene," huh?

24
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,659
I'm just not convinced yet.

38
00:03:56,649 --> 00:03:58,596

253
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,017

23
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,671

Something you'd like to share?

130
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,188
The timing couldn't be better!

144
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:03,029
Thanks for watching the store.

214
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:07,134
Where did you see this poster?

227
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:41,161
Yeah, of course! Bonus points!

260
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,967
The student council president.

336
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,254
It's not so much that, either.

345
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:24,340
Mm-hmm. Let's hear them, then.

360
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,961
Why choose that in particular?

416
00:22:47,688 --> 00:22:49,304
I wanna help Chitanda prepare.

30
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:35,611
This is boring. I'm outta here.

197
00:12:10,074 --> 00:12:12,407
Don't worry about me! I'm fine.

52
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,328
My head-on approach didn't work.

125
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:15,812
Yeah, that's right. Who are you?

188
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,428
I really didn't mean to do that.

324
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:07,813
Great! Then you have to tell us!

421
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:04,371
Right. Bait... I like that idea.

65
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:03,897
I didn't think you would show up!

67
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:09,088
her dear little brother is doing?

91
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:15,406
I think it turned out very well."

96
00:06:25,938 --> 00:06:27,410
Credit where it's due, you know?"

138
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,813
We meet at 12 noon in the studio!

195
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,616
I hope you can manage without me.

222
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,708
It was lucky that I ran into you!

234
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:58,938
We're really sorry to bother you,

362
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,251
It was at the Cooking Club event.

381
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,734
and <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> .

402
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:02,492
At this year's Cultural Festival,

6
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:28,707
You're a little late this morning.

159
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,539
My sister just brought this to me.

218
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:25,021
I'm 99% sure it's the same person.

230
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,489
Hello. You're from the... hold on.

283
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,823
We couldn't have asked for better.

309
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,702
I need to borrow you for a second.

311
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,979
Hey, is that true? Tell us, Oreki!

346
00:19:24,604 --> 00:19:26,398
I'm looking forward to it, Hotaro.

361
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,938
That reminds me. I picked this up.

32
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,143
What's wrong, phantom thief Jumoji?

305
00:17:10,146 --> 00:17:12,162
But Chitanda would stand in my way.

339
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:00,004
There are over a thousand suspects.

378
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,584
I'd say, <i>And Then There Were None</i> ,

379
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,612
Then <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i> ,

388
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,533
<i>And Then There Were None</i> , instead.

412
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:35,090
Still, why would he skip over "ku?"

423
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:22,632
I have high hopes for this, Hotaro.

16
00:00:50,073 --> 00:00:52,145
If you're gonna strike, bring it on!

42
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,484
You're sure that's good information?

113
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:29,064
"We picked another foreboding name."

117
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:41,938
I don't know what "Kudryavka" means,

127
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,619
I am so glad you were actually here!

139
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,871
The broadcast starts at 12:30 sharp.

158
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,021
Your eyes are playing tricks on you.

160
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,588
No way. There's no doubt in my mind.

264
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:24,332
What do you mean, "Anshinin Takuha?"

265
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,605
That's meant to be read as, "Ajimu."

296
00:16:39,604 --> 00:16:41,740
One of Christie's most famous works.

14
00:00:45,737 --> 00:00:47,656
the crime must not have happened yet.

73
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:25,468
You can blame the Warashibe protocol.

181
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,006
This is some fine artwork right here.

244
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,865
I now know the author and the artist!

328
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:24,493
Sorry to drag you out here with this.

329
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,752
No worries. Doesn't bother me at all.

27
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,777
Is Jumoji's next target the Quiz Club?

33
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:44,876
Were you scared off by all the people?

51
00:04:26,188 --> 00:04:27,984
I might be a bit out of my depth here.

58
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,122
so she brought another ten down there.

111
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,063
"The next story is going to be called:

129
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:23,979
You're the Classic Lit Club president!

314
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,430
Have you had some kind of realization?

31
00:03:35,993 --> 00:03:38,463
Yeah, man. This scene's over. I'm gone.

53
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:32,663
I have to go back to the drawing board.

71
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,158
It doesn't really suit you, little bro.

169
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,621
Just let me look at another page, okay?

226
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,762
Would you like to find out who drew it?

246
00:14:26,717 --> 00:14:29,306
I hope this lucky streak keeps rolling.

312
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,856
No one asked you to share your hunches!

357
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:55,192
Wouldn't you say "stolen," or, "taken?"

411
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:33,146
I don't think this is all just for fun.

430
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,855
I'm your favorite DJ, Yasukuni Yoshino.

434
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:02,707
I'm so happy to be here talking to you!

2
00:00:10,672 --> 00:00:12,359
they must have kicked it into high gear.

37
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,109
Is that right? Did he hit the Quiz Club?

59
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,499
Then I sold nine more just this morning.

334
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:42,271
No. I haven't discovered anything there.

93
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,149
I didn't have much to do with it at all."

135
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,394
I couldn't have planned it better myself!

145
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:05,156
Have there been any further developments?

178
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,982
Just make sure you bring it back quickly.

205
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,726
What? That's crazy! Where did you get it?

241
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:17,231
It's absolutely beautiful! A masterpiece!

303
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:04,248
My thoughts were at a standstill, anyway.

20
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,947
I wonder if I've met her somewhere before.

56
00:04:38,933 --> 00:04:41,045
When they sell, they sell out, don't they?

60
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,894
I'm starting to have some hope about this.

131
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,093
I was literally just on my way to see you!

148
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,640
I think we should start over from scratch.

150
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,386
He's all engrossed with that <i>doujin</i> manga;

208
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,304
He said that his sister brought it to him.

323
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:06,044
It does have to do with the Jumoji affair.

385
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:10,111
Well, Kudryavka was a nickname for the dog

424
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:37,236
We go live when he gives us the cue, okay?

151
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,454
he's had his head buried in it for a while.

250
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,548
Why the gym clothes? What about Manga Club?

271
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,571
Oh. So you know something about this manga?

375
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:45,365
That's my hunch, but I haven't decided yet.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,752
When it comes to high gear, I can't be beat.

275
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:58,934
Do you think... I could borrow it for a bit?

432
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:58,021
is Classic Lit Club president, Eru Chitanda!

74
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:27,863
Your pen turned into this little hand mirror.

219
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,568
The way they handle the ears is unmistakable.

102
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,913
I will let the creators toot their own horns."

118
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,222
but the word "sequence" captures my attention.

136
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,992
I would be honored to be a guest on your show!

276
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,396
Yeah, that's cool, but give me a little while.

422
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:07,712
Proofed manuscripts? <i>Koryogenko</i> fits the bill.

242
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,896
He'll be tickled when I tell him you said that.

1
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,604
If this is already up this early in the morning,

400
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,896
You and I have said we think that work is either

413
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,665
There are a number of ways to pull that one off.

359
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,872
It's not the only thing that lists all the clubs.

76
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,810
You mean you traded my pen and ended up with that?

119
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,704
Also, which "one of Christie's most famous works?"

147
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,986
He stole <i>gen</i> , a string from the Light Music Club.

310
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,564
You've figured something out, haven't you, Hotaro?

344
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,740
I just need to gather my thoughts a little better.

401
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,712
<i>And Then There Were None</i> , or <i>The A.B.C. Murders</i> .

394
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:36,440
At least, the executive committee hasn't been told.

414
00:22:38,044 --> 00:22:41,255
Satoshi, there's a specific reason he's doing this.

36
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,896
Hmph. That dirty thief Jumoji made a fool out of us.

206
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,886
I borrowed it from Oreki. He was reading it earlier.

273
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:54,396
For Ibara to say that openly, it must be remarkable.

325
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:10,532
It's obscene. That's why I left you out of it. Okay?

343
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,500
Look, it's not like I don't have any ideas about it.

370
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,479
That's simple: he did it to keep from being noticed.

79
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,573
I'll take it off your hands, and in return you get...

161
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,307
Chitanda, this is really not the time for that stuff.

368
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,527
Sixth question, and no doubt the weirdest one of all:

387
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:16,047
With that violent image in mind, I think I would say,

428
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:48,233
A special broadcast of Yasukuni Yoshino's Radio Beat!

57
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:44,994
The 20 copies Chitanda gave to Irisu are already gone,

245
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,574
Maybe I'll get the chance to chat with them in person!

291
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:32,746
"How can you manage to stand out with so little time?"

352
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:44,935
Why does he leave a calling card at all of his crimes?

367
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,372
Lit Club or the Industrial Arts Club will be hit next.

17
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,341
It's the last day of the festival: the moment of truth.

262
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:15,864
This whole time I thought it was pronounced "Rikuyama."

267
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,459
Is that information crucial to surviving my daily life?

320
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:56,017
I'm curious, and I want to be in the loop about things.

431
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,945
With me on this, the last day of the Cultural Festival,

9
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:36,016
It's gonna be hard to keep Jumoji at large at this rate.

63
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:00,938
I see you've decided to take on the easy work, as usual.

106
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,438
"Our writer, A, is considering turning the writing style

175
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:30,175
Hey, Oreki. Would you mind letting me borrow this manga?

209
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:51,536
Mayaka, how familiar are you with this particular manga?

386
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:13,218
the Soviets shot into space, but she never made it back.

11
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:40,818
You're pretty determined if you're staking out this early.

54
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:36,508
If I can't catch him in the act, then how can I catch him?

107
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:11,474
completely on its ear and delving into the mystery genre."

157
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:39,296
For some reason, that picture looks really familiar to me.

190
00:11:34,657 --> 00:11:38,698
It's khaki, so even if it stains, it won't show up anyway.

288
00:16:24,732 --> 00:16:27,829
First and foremost, guests are only allotted five minutes.

364
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,592
There are several other clubs that start with "E" and "O."

50
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,872
Jumoji's adaptability is more
sophisticated than I thought.

284
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:19,271
Our goal of selling all these
copies just got within reach!

332
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,622
and I have a feeling that they
might be pretty significant.

358
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:58,973
Fourth, why does he always
leave a Kanyasai guidebook, too?

366
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:21,244
Answering that could help us
figure out whether the Classic

313
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:32,930
Now Chitanda's got that
insatiably curious look in her eyes!

349
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,609
We just assumed that because
of the way he signed his notes.

350
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:41,188
And that assumption has since
been challenged by new events.

384
00:21:04,614 --> 00:21:07,447
I'd think they would use, <i>The
A.B.C. Murders</i> , wouldn't you?

89
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:11,403
What do you think of the way <i>A
Corpse by Evening</i> turned out?"

109
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,768
then see if there's any room
for a few twists here and there."

356
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:53,103
Why does he keep saying that
the missing items have been lost?

374
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,300
Are you implying the manga has
something to do with this case?

407
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:20,455
I guess I'm saying I don't
think they're completely unrelated.

29
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:32,940
Why steal something from them
when their event is already over?

92
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:18,172
Of course, all I did was help
out with some of the backgrounds.

124
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,976
Pardon, but are you Yoshino,
the Broadcasting Club's president?

331
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:33,025
I just have a few problems I
can't seem to wrap my head around,

369
00:20:27,646 --> 00:20:30,864
Why did he decide to skip over
"ku," and hit "ke" next instead?

418
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,738
I'm going to see if there's
anything in this stuff you gave me.

196
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:10,049
You need to change out of your
rainbow parakeet costume, though.

237
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:08,729
What? You mean Muneyoshi Kugayama?
The student council president?

22
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:07,098
But I'm not convinced it's a good
enough plan to sell all of them.

132
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,232
Would you like to be a guest on
our radio show today during lunch?

173
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,168
It looks similar to a poster I
saw outside of the conference room!

238
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:12,280
The same. I had to badger him a
bit to convince him, but he caved.

330
00:18:26,868 --> 00:18:29,838
It's not even like I have anything
earth-shattering to talk about.

258
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,603
All right. Come on, Hotaro, that's
enough messing around for today.

316
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,453
So, then, are you saying this
isn't about the Jumoji matter at all?

285
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,313
Now, let me coach you through the
basics of giving a good interview.

306
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:15,855
If she knew what I was trying to
do, she'd definitely be against it.

399
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,238
that was going to be a take on one
of "Christie's most famous works."

391
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,816
Satoshi, do you know if there's a
manga called, <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i>

13
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:45,655
Judging by the fact that there are
this many amateur detectives around,

272
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:51,091
It's one of my favorites. I bought
it at last year's cultural festival.

376
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:48,811
What do you think when you hear,
"one of Christie's most famous works?"

97
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:31,501
I guess Anshinin Takuha is just the
name they adopted for the whole team?

114
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:33,735
"Okay, I look forward to seeing you
next year during the Kanyasai season!

363
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:11,097
Fifth, why'd he choose to target the
Cooking Club and the Gardening Club?

43
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:10,131
If you don't believe me, then why
don't you just investigate for yourself?

389
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:21,854
Well, since we're only speculating,
we don't have to pin it down just yet.

397
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:46,715
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> came out at last
year's Cultural Festival, apparently.

410
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:31,031
causing an uproar at the festival
with as little interference as possible.

66
00:05:03,942 --> 00:05:07,310
What, you're not grateful that your
big sister cares enough to come see how

122
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,780
You really better not have just laid
a bunch of work down on my feet again.

420
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:02,549
Tell Chitanda to have some "ko" items
out somewhere they'd be easy to find.

21
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:02,712
The idea to use Jumoji to sell copies
of <i>Hyouka</i> isn't necessarily a bad one.

213
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:02,929
I think the style's identical, but I
need an expert opinion! I have to know!

101
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:49,438
"I think it's kind of extraordinary for
a maiden effort, but that's my opinion.

304
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:08,395
Normally, I would try to get unstuck by
talking everything out with these guys.

365
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:18,740
Especially since the Cooking Club's
usually called the <i>Ryori</i> Club, not <i>Oryori</i> .

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,413
Whether you decide to spend your valuable
time reading it is entirely up to you.

120
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:53,676
Whether you decide to spend your valuable
time reading it is entirely up to you.

390
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:27,647
I believe I'm finally beginning to piece
together what you're getting at, Hotaro.

98
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:36,015
"It's not even as though every single
one of us is in the Manga Club or anything."

100
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:45,558
When we decided to try making a manga of
our own, this is the story that emerged."

235
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,549
but we're curious: Could you tell us who
drew that poster on the wall right there?

348
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:34,327
What's the evidence that he's stealing
ten specific items from ten different clubs?

395
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,644
I also think Mayaka would have mentioned
it to us if the Manga Club was selling it.

398
00:21:48,021 --> 00:21:50,896
In the afterword, there was an announcement
that they would write a manga this year

333
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:39,451
Did you discover some hidden link between
the clubs that have already fallen victim?

335
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:46,364
Then, did you find some mistake in Jumoji's
methods that might lead us to an answer?

105
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,340
"We have already started working on
something new with next year's Kanyasai in mind."

110
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:22,874
"The title has already been chosen, so I
suppose I'll go ahead and announce it here."

104
00:06:56,354 --> 00:07:01,090
"Now, keep in mind: We have no intention of
breaking up the team after just one title."

94
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:24,503
"If you really enjoy the finished product,
the credit goes to the author and the artist,

270
00:15:38,822 --> 00:15:43,806
Kugayama did the artwork, but the story
itself was written by someone named Anjo Haruna.

108
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:15,827
"The word on the street is that they plan to
take on one of Christie's most famous works,

269
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:38,531
The pronunciation is written in Romanized
text right here on the cover, next to the name.

103
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:56,243
"I also want the reader to decide for
themselves, without me putting ideas in their heads."

340
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:04,789
How are we ever supposed to identify the
culprit without finding any real leads or mistakes?

403
00:22:02,896 --> 00:22:07,705
events similar to <i>The A.B.C. Murders</i> are
taking place, albeit on a much less sinister scale.

99
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:41,061
"We all just like manga a lot, and really hit it
off when we would get together to talk about it.

279
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:10,271
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot! The Broadcasting Club
is having me as a guest on their lunchtime show!

371
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:37,313
The Global Action Club was crawling with civilians,
and it would've made the crime too difficult.

263
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:21,941
So that means this Kugayama guy is the artist of
the Anshinin Takuha group who created that manga?

383
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:04,438
If someone were to use one of them as the basis
for a manga with the title <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> ,

409
00:22:22,816 --> 00:22:27,479
I think this Jumoji character is just trying to
carry on with his little caper for as long as he can,

133
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:37,112
I think interviewing the president of the club that's
sure to be Jumoji's final target would be a huge hit.

405
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:16,125
In other words, you think the key to solving the Jumoji
case is contained in the end of " <i>A Corpse by Evening</i> ."

212
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:59,504
I saw a poster promoting the Cultural Festival, and I'm
certain that whoever drew this manga also drew the poster!
