1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:06,635
So, Chitanda, can you say with certainty
that you will catch the phantom thief Jumoji?

2
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,852
Of course we will!

3
00:00:07,931 --> 00:00:09,171
Well, that's our intention.

4
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,513
With all of your...

5
00:00:11,173 --> 00:00:13,095
With everyone helping us out,

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,059
I don't think there's any logical reason
that we wouldn't be able to catch Jumoji!

7
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,982
Whoa, that's a pretty bold statement!

8
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:22,746
Then my next question: What do
you think Jumoji is after now?

9
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:26,482
Well, we've already gotten something
ready that fits his pattern of thefts:

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,895
proofed manuscripts.

11
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,197
Proofed manuscripts?

12
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:29,826
Yes.

13
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:33,163
Corrected drafts of the Classic
Lit Club's anthology, <i>Hyouka</i>.

14
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:33,909
Huh?

15
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:35,783
Are there fewer of them?

16
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:41,209
Our anthology contains a story no less compelling
than the Jumoji Caper, so come pick one up!

17
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,206
Because if you like mystery as much as we do,

18
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:47,232
you'll love this tale that will
keep you on the edge of your seat!

19
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:49,980
Wow, that does sound pretty intriguing!

20
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:50,553
Yes.

21
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:54,829
Everyone! Please come check out the
Classic Lit Club's anthology, <i>Hyouka</i>!

22
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,854
It's great! I know you're all gonna love it! Thanks!

23
00:00:58,474 --> 00:00:59,562
One more thing,

24
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:04,329
as we're getting ready to roll out the red carpet
for Jumoji, we'd like to ask everyone for a small favor.

25
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,878
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

26
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:10,538
Well, since there are only four of us in the
club, we need help keeping an eye on everything.

27
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:14,451
So everyone, if you have some free
time, come help the Classic Lit Club!

28
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:16,040
And I mean everyone!

29
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:18,741
We are counting on all of you to help!

30
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:21,530
I understand!

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,206
Strength in numbers, am I right?

32
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:24,183
Yes!

33
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:27,408
We expect everyone to come help us out! Thanks in advance!

34
00:01:27,496 --> 00:01:30,880
Hmm... I've always been a sucker for a desperate request!

35
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,580
Another thing...

36
00:01:33,248 --> 00:01:35,711
...if you come by and you think you can...

37
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:39,996
...please buy an anthology. Okay?

38
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,544
And so, the final target, the Classic
Lit Club, is more than ready to engage!

39
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,446
Well, Chitanda, happy hunting!

40
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:47,897
Thank you for your time.

41
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,204
We hope you all decide to stand with us.

42
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:53,329
That was Eru Chitanda, everyone!

43
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,030
Okay, we're off the air.

44
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:00,273
Hey, that was a decent interview!

45
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,110
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:02,597 --> 00:02:03,681
Is something wrong?

47
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,192
Nothing.

48
00:02:06,972 --> 00:02:09,656
I'm just not sure if I should be doing all of this.

49
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:56,746
One, please.

50
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,030
200 yen.

51
00:03:59,277 --> 00:04:00,069
One, please.

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,219
200 yen.

53
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:03,226
One, please.

54
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:08,426
Whoa! They're selling! This is great!

55
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:11,025
We're so close. Almost sold out.

56
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:12,892
Do you think he's really coming?

57
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,512
As packed as this place is right now,

58
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,792
he couldn't make his move!

59
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:17,135
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,622
It'd be impossible like this.

61
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,942
How long do you think this thief is going to make us wait?

62
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:22,429
Does Jumoji even exist?

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,857
Could they be doing all of this themselves?

64
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:25,421
Yeah, I hadn't even thought of that!

65
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,654
Show yourself, already, Jumoji.

66
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,733
Sorry about that. Just my cell phone.

67
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,282
Geez.

68
00:04:35,338 --> 00:04:36,275
You gonna answer?

69
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,062
Nah. Not till after our watch...

70
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:41,382
Hey, it's on fire!

71
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:42,995
It's on fire!

72
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:45,147
Put it out! Put it out!

73
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:02,897
Water?

74
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:08,774
We've been had.

75
00:05:15,838 --> 00:05:17,505
Look. He left this.

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,321
It's Jumoji's confession note, all right.

77
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,273
I hate to say, "I told you so."

78
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:30,030
Wait, you never said this would happen!

79
00:05:30,404 --> 00:05:31,321
He got them good, huh?

80
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,488
Now I'm thinking Jumoji might be a girl!

81
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:37,079
Huh? What makes you say that?

82
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,788
I mean, just think about it.

83
00:05:58,538 --> 00:05:59,704
We sold out.

84
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:00,656
Huh?

85
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,977
I'm sorry I couldn't sell them at the list price.

86
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,836
No, don't worry! This is great!

87
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,680
Thanks so much. I mean it.

88
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:17,674
Really, you have no idea!

89
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,535
Oh, stand up. And another thing...

90
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,321
Yes?

91
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,513
I don't know if I should tell you this...

92
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,529
Should tell me what?

93
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,221
I heard your radio broadcast.

94
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:35,233
Oh, did you think that I followed your advice correctly?

95
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,830
Look, about that...

96
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:39,665
My advice was a bit too literal.

97
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:42,429
I want to be clear about this.

98
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,647
You aren't really suited for stuff like that.

99
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:50,359
When you try so hard to manipulate the expectations
of others, you come across as kind of needy.

100
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:52,584
Needy?

101
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:55,542
Do you really think that's how I sounded?

102
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:58,083
Maybe as much as the tip of my little finger.

103
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,394
However, sometimes, if you pretend to be something,

104
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,246
you wind up becoming that way in your real life somehow.

105
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,320
Right.

106
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:10,293
You'd really do better to not take my words at
face value if you're only going to botch the execution.

107
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:13,425
You might see your inability
to manipulate as a shortcoming,

108
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,474
but under the right circumstances,
it's a valuable weapon.

109
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,494
So... You understand?

110
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,040
Yes. I was kind of thinking the same thing!

111
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,956
I'm just not cut out for this sort of stuff.

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,354
I guess, what I mean is...

113
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,272
Well... I've had enough.

114
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:42,205
That was exciting.

115
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,371
Wow, not even the Classic Lit
Club could catch Jumoji, huh?

116
00:07:46,427 --> 00:07:48,103
I expected so much from you.

117
00:07:48,357 --> 00:07:49,573
Yeah, well...

118
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:52,839
Sorry I haven't lived up to your expectations.

119
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:54,029
No way.

120
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:56,279
It was still an entertaining cultural festival.

121
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:59,457
Plus, I got my revenge for the cooking competition.

122
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:00,370
See ya.

123
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:02,873
Who's he?

124
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:03,976
That's Tani.

125
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:08,682
He doesn't get the subtleties of language.

126
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,746
You know?

127
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:10,992
What do you mean?

128
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,822
He said "expected."

129
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:15,871
That's not really what you say to
your opponent when neither of you won.

130
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:18,255
Why does that matter? "Expected"...

131
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,187
Using that word implies that it's finished.

132
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,316
If you still believe in yourself, it's not appropriate.

133
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,549
The way he phrased it...

134
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,579
It's not right, 'cause this isn't over.

135
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,929
Unless there's no hope, and things have gone worse
than imagined, there's no point in using that word.

136
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,239
Fukube...

137
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,523
Anyway, the cards haven't all fallen.

138
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:43,189
I swear I saw Hotaro come this way.

139
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:47,254
There he is.

140
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,079
Let's cut to the chase, then, shall we?

141
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,138
You are Jumoji, aren't you?

142
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,999
You might as well confess.

143
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,669
What? Just a shot in the dark?

144
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,798
Tanabe's Jumoji?

145
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,442
First, there's your card.

146
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:05,059
Why does it always say "lost,"
rather than "stolen" or "taken?"

147
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:06,527
Who knows?

148
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:11,573
My next question deals with the
letter "ku." Why did you skip it?

149
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:13,956
That alone should eliminate the Jumoji theory,

150
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:17,762
but what if it dealt with some element that
the rest of the school didn't know anything about?

151
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,423
Something not meant for the public.

152
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,433
Oh? Like what?

153
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:22,157
The Jumoji Caper itself.

154
00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:24,595
The entire affair was only a code, wasn't it?

155
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,986
You had to deliver a message,

156
00:09:27,097 --> 00:09:28,695
to one whose name starts with "ku,"

157
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,126
and something beginning with "ku" had already been lost.

158
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,413
It was two-fold.

159
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:35,123
That's a convoluted code for relaying a message.

160
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:36,783
A layman could never crack it,

161
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:40,573
but if the recipient already knew the
rules of the cipher, it would be easy.

162
00:09:41,042 --> 00:09:42,625
To cut right to the chase...

163
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:47,517
I believe that was the plot of <i>The Kudryavka
Sequence,</i> the manga you were all planning to write.

164
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,504
You're wondering how on Earth I could know the title.

165
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,379
Isn't that right?

166
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:58,246
<i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> is a take on one
of Agatha Christie's most famous works,

167
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,077
<i>The A.B.C. Murders.</i>

168
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:02,563
Same goes for the Jumoji Caper.

169
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,703
The culprit used <i>The Kudryavka
Sequence</i> as his source material.

170
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:10,096
As for the intended recipient of the coded message,

171
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,329
that's Muneyoshi Kugayama.

172
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,107
Student council president.

173
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:17,141
And the artist behind <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>.

174
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:18,889
Am I wrong?

175
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:20,765
Hmm...

176
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,377
Why would all the other targets be clubs, and then
switch it up to have "ku" represent someone's name?

177
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:31,507
Jumoji never wrote anything to establish
that all the targets would be clubs.

178
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:33,812
It's a bit thin. It's not that thin at all.

179
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:38,514
You put out a list, and implied that all of
your victims would be chosen from among those on it.

180
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,996
Copying the timetable bit from
<i>The A.B.C. Murders</i> was obvious.

181
00:10:43,021 --> 00:10:45,491
I mean, you had a list already drawn up for you.

182
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,938
All the victims were together, right here on this page.

183
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:52,999
The Acapella Club, the Go Club, the
Fortunetelling Club, the Gardening Club,

184
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,269
the Cooking Club, the Wall Newspaper Club,

185
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,724
the Magic Club, and finally...

186
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,440
...Muneyoshi Kugayama.

187
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,825
Once I put it all together, it
wasn't difficult to trace back to you.

188
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:06,941
It's incredibly convenient that all the
targeted clubs were listed together on this page.

189
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:11,079
Only someone on the executive committee
could have orchestrated this page that way.

190
00:11:11,294 --> 00:11:13,871
Fine, but there are 20 other people on that committee.

191
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,499
Yes. That brings me to the manga.

192
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,842
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i>.

193
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:23,514
President Kugayama, the author, had
teamed up with Haruna Anjo on this one,

194
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:26,303
so he must have known about <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i>.

195
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:31,135
That means President Kugayama would also
be able to decipher the Jumoji Caper's code.

196
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:38,499
One possibility is that Kugayama lost the original
story for <i>The Kudryavka Sequence,</i> thus providing a motive.

197
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:44,211
Jumoji could have concocted this whole
scheme in order to exact revenge for that, right?

198
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:48,460
Meaning the message he was trying
to relay with these crimes is this:

199
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:52,435
"Kugayama has already forfeited his Kudryavka Sequence."

200
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:55,730
Now, consider this afterword:

201
00:11:56,224 --> 00:11:59,107
It was written by the same person
who helped with the backgrounds.

202
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:00,784
Haruna Anjo.

203
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,496
President Kugayama.

204
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:07,260
Other than those two, only one other person
knows the plot line of <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i>.

205
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:10,206
That person is the only possible culprit here,

206
00:12:10,371 --> 00:12:11,819
and then there's this:

207
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:15,288
"Takuha Ajimu." That's quite an odd penname.

208
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:20,464
But it's just a mash-up of the first characters in
the names of the three people who wrote this, right?

209
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,789
How's that?

210
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,713
"Haruna Anjo" gives us "Ha" and "A."

211
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,663
"Muneyoshi Kugayama." There's the "Mu" and "Ku."

212
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:31,865
Take away those four letters, and you're
left with two characters: "Ji" and "Ta."

213
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,774
It has to be a second year or higher,

214
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,888
someone who was at last year's cultural festival,

215
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:41,421
on the executive committee, and
whose initials are "Ji" and "Ta."

216
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:47,101
We also can deduce that it has to be someone who knows
President Kugayama well enough to know he draws manga.

217
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,939
There's only one person who fits that bill.

218
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,142
And that would be you.

219
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,447
Jiro Tanabe.

220
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,285
Well done, sir.

221
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:14,759
I never imagined in my wildest dreams that anyone other
than Mune or Anjo would be able to crack my little code.

222
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:17,284
I'll be damned.

223
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:20,613
Expectations, smashed. Way to go.

224
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:27,917
Why did you use such a roundabout
way to send your message?

225
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,339
I think you know the answer.

226
00:13:31,674 --> 00:13:35,885
Is it because of your feelings for Haruna
Anjo, who was transferred to another school?

227
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:37,894
That was a part of it.

228
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:40,713
It's also just that it was the cultural festival.

229
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,542
I was dying to pull off a well-executed prank.

230
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,480
Although...

231
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,650
...not being able to say it out loud...

232
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,882
That was the biggest reason.

233
00:13:54,038 --> 00:13:56,415
Well, there's another matter I'd like to discuss.

234
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:59,929
I just have a small request to make of you, Tanabe.

235
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:01,220
Yeah? What's that?

236
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,239
I'd like you to buy these from me.

237
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,911
Thirty copies of <i>Hyouka,</i> our anthology.

238
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:11,721
Are you blackmailing me into buying
these in exchange for your silence?

239
00:14:11,995 --> 00:14:12,582
Yep.

240
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,746
I'm actually asking the executive committee to buy them.

241
00:14:15,849 --> 00:14:16,722
That's absurd.

242
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,496
There's nothing absurd about it.

243
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,407
This is Kami High's website.

244
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:24,471
That's a mail-order link, a place to buy
items from the cultural festival, right?

245
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,704
You could have the executive committee buy these,

246
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,408
then resell them through this link on the website.

247
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,143
I can't just agree to resell them without a good reason.

248
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:35,931
There has to be some kind of buzz about them first.

249
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,480
Absolutely.

250
00:14:37,663 --> 00:14:40,740
But lucky for us, there's already
a good deal of hype around <i>Hyouka</i>.

251
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,287
What are you talking about?

252
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:44,950
Don't you know? Jumoji, of course.

253
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:47,874
The Classic Lit Club is going to be your final target.

254
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:54,611
I can help, and Satoshi Fukube will also
be an accomplice once I officially ask him.

255
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,844
You'll have inside men at the target.

256
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:58,775
You couldn't ask for an easier job.

257
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:04,579
People will flock to the Classic Lit Club
room to try to catch Jumoji at his last target.

258
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:09,945
The anthologies will fly off the shelves, creating a
demand for them online, and then you'll sell them there.

259
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:14,401
It gives you the perfect opportunity to
wrap up your scheme in a nice little package.

260
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:16,187
What do you say?

261
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,072
That's not bad.

262
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,717
Yeah, I like the sound of it!

263
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:26,619
A dramatic close to the Jumoji Caper, and
also providing items for the mail order site.

264
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,907
It's beneficial to both parties.

265
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:31,443
I'm glad we agree.

266
00:15:31,856 --> 00:15:35,454
So how do you plan to aid and abet Jumoji in his crimes?

267
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:38,528
We'll prepare a proofed
manuscript, which will be your target.

268
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,230
Then we'll post guards to
surround it, so no one can get close.

269
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,289
Oh? Then what?

270
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:47,875
According to the guidebook, the
Chemistry Club is doing a demonstration

271
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,894
on what happens when water is
poured directly over pure sodium.

272
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:55,636
I saw a video of it once online. It
flares up, and looks pretty spectacular.

273
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,798
You don't plan on doing that, do you?

274
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:58,704
I do.

275
00:15:58,837 --> 00:16:00,905
I want you to somehow get a hold of the sodium.

276
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,201
Once you do that, we'll need water pistols.

277
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,633
Some members of the Confection
Club are carrying them around.

278
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:07,516
You'll have to negotiate with them for one.

279
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,441
You sure play a dangerous game, don't you?

280
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:14,585
It's festival week.

281
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,154
Why don't we close it out with a bang?

282
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:20,288
All right.

283
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:24,857
Then after we get the sodium, I'll figure out a
way to slip some of it into the manuscript pages.

284
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:28,932
Once we sell enough copies,
I'll give you a signal, like this,

285
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,778
and that's when I want you to
shoot the pages with the water pistol.

286
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:35,497
But everyone's going to be watching
the manuscript like hawks, aren't they?

287
00:16:35,751 --> 00:16:37,110
Yeah, that's true.

288
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:41,827
Okay, how about this: I'll get Satoshi
to put his cell phone by the door.

289
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,809
Just call it before you shoot the manuscript,
and it will divert people's attention.

290
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:46,945
They won't know what hit them.

291
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,358
Good idea.

292
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,599
What should we do about the confession note?

293
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:55,310
The room will probably devolve into chaos, so just
slip it into a copy of <i>Hyouka</i> and drop it on the floor.

294
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,499
That sounds good.

295
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:59,464
All right, well, you'll have to buy a copy to do that.

296
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,079
That'll be 200 yen.

297
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,080
You're quite the salesman.

298
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:06,179
We really are up a creek here, so I'm desperate.

299
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,708
What did you say your name was, again?

300
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:19,367
I'm Hotaro Oreki. I'm from Class 1-B.

301
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:31,219
Are "expectations" what pop into
your mind when you think about Oreki?

302
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:36,100
That's astute. What gave it away?

303
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,197
I can just tell by watching.

304
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:40,484
Only when it comes to you, though.

305
00:17:46,242 --> 00:17:48,897
Fuku, were you trying to beat Oreki?

306
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,221
It's not that I want to beat him.

307
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,922
I just look up to him a lot.

308
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,272
But...

309
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,340
I don't expect you to understand that, Mayaka.

310
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,517
No, I think I get it.

311
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:06,335
Well, I really messed this up.

312
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:08,966
I forgot my main rule.

313
00:18:10,273 --> 00:18:13,273
Databases can't ever come up with conclusions.

314
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,231
And so, the 54th Kanyasai closes without incident.

315
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:29,649
Although, there were a number of "odd occurrences."

316
00:18:34,704 --> 00:18:35,743
Way to go!

317
00:18:37,744 --> 00:18:39,811
Anyway, good work all around, folks.

318
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:45,491
I hereby declare the 54th annual Kamiyama
High School Cultural Festival officially closed!

319
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:56,280
I know this may be too little, too late, but I brought it.

320
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,784
This manga was written by someone whom I
believe will someday write a masterpiece.

321
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,089
You actually found a copy.

322
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:06,329
Yes.

323
00:19:06,552 --> 00:19:08,634
This isn't mine, though. I borrowed it.

324
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,996
But Kochi, you already knew about this manga, didn't you?

325
00:19:13,091 --> 00:19:14,139
Yuasa told you.

326
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:15,288
That jerk.

327
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,499
She did.

328
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:20,028
Yuasa said that you and the author
used to be close friends or something.

329
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,204
Friends? Yeah, that's right.

330
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,809
I wonder how Haruna is doing these days.

331
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,827
It's been a while since I've heard from her.

332
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,934
Have you ever read this manga?

333
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,967
I have to say...

334
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:39,451
I think I understand what you said a little better now.

335
00:19:39,657 --> 00:19:43,757
That whether or not a manga is appealing
is ultimately a subjective matter.

336
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:46,954
I get it, but I still don't
think you're right across the board.

337
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:50,829
I mean, that would take all the hope
and fun out of reading, wouldn't it?

338
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,475
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> is a perfect example.

339
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:57,032
It's a really serious title.

340
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,647
If I were only into gag manga, I
wouldn't even give it a second thought.

341
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:02,496
That's just how people are.

342
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,690
But if they did read it, they would like it!

343
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:08,203
Some works have a powerful impact on people, regardless!

344
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,651
On those with discerning tastes, maybe.

345
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:11,994
I don't agree!

346
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,669
I'm messing with you.

347
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:22,472
I'm joking.

348
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,252
Come on, I feel the same way you do about manga.

349
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,613
You're just too passionate to see it.

350
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,007
You're so sincere.

351
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,904
It's all bluster. Ayako doesn't mean it.

352
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,871
That manga keeps coming back to haunt me,

353
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,484
so I guess I'm supposed to have this conversation.

354
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,155
I haven't read the whole thing. I gave up halfway.

355
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,788
Know why?

356
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:44,935
I don't.

357
00:20:45,101 --> 00:20:47,953
You told me before that I would understand if I read it.

358
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:52,012
And I get it, I really do. It's good.

359
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:55,813
But I don't actually want to have to admit that it's good.

360
00:20:56,087 --> 00:20:57,374
It's all about my pride.

361
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:01,666
Say you had a friend who didn't read
manga, but knew you were really into it.

362
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,605
Then that friend teamed up with someone.

363
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:05,949
And decided to draw one herself.

364
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:06,893
So?

365
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,832
If it were great, wouldn't you be a little angry?

366
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,543
That's why I keep it tucked in the back of my closet.

367
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,134
I swore I'd never read it.

368
00:21:16,189 --> 00:21:18,906
Out of spite and pettiness, I refused to open it.

369
00:21:19,226 --> 00:21:21,551
I swore to always say that it was no good.

370
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,428
But fate just had to keep throwing it in my face.

371
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:30,711
Look, I'm sorry you went and got a copy
for me, because I am still not gonna read it.

372
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:31,711
Wait...

373
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:37,585
I mean, if I were to read it, then
I'd be forced to reach out to her.

374
00:21:37,726 --> 00:21:39,413
And how could I bring myself to say,

375
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:40,996
"I read it, and you're amazing!

376
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,156
I have really high expectations for your next one!"

377
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,325
I can't make myself do that! You know?

378
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:01,770
That cat... It's from <i>Body Talk</i>!

379
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:16,126
A masterpiece is a masterpiece from
the beginning. It doesn't become one.

380
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,058
<i>Body Talk</i>.

381
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:22,466
There's no denying it's a step below <i>A Corpse by Evening</i>.

382
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:25,287
My stuff is a hundred steps below.

383
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,418
Is this pile really all that's left of them?

384
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:36,898
Yeah.

385
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,376
Whoa... Whoa!

386
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,626
I can't believe it!

387
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:41,346
I can't believe we pulled this off!

388
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:42,425
It's incredible!

389
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:44,714
We sold almost 200 anthologies!

390
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:46,477
I never expected to do that!

391
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,250
"Expected."

392
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,638
Interesting.

393
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,909
Oh... nothing.

394
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:59,076
I can't ever tell Chitanda that I
resorted to blackmail to sell these things.

395
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:00,061
Hey, Oreki.

396
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:02,121
Earlier, you mentioned you thought that the reason

397
00:23:02,176 --> 00:23:04,194
I started this whole thing was to get revenge

398
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:07,762
on Kugayama for losing the
<i>Kudryavka Sequence,</i> isn't that right?

399
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,343
It was just a hypothesis.

400
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:12,621
I have no real way of knowing what
your true motive was in doing it.

401
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:16,329
Well, it's astute.

402
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:20,265
Especially because Anjo is the only
person who truly knows how I feel.

403
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:24,292
Wait, are you saying Kugayama has no idea?

404
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:25,905
Yeah.

405
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,554
But the code was invented and
executed with him in mind, right?

406
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:30,638
That's correct.

407
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,022
Then what's the point?

408
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:40,667
Ever since Mune... I mean, ever since
Kugayama finished <i>A Corpse by Evening,</i>

409
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,544
he hasn't picked up his pen to write again, not even once.

410
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:46,627
Anjo is brilliant, too, don't get me wrong,

411
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:49,209
but I had no idea Kugayama could draw so well.

412
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:52,157
I wish I had his talent, but I'm mediocre at best.

413
00:23:53,484 --> 00:23:55,114
I couldn't hold a candle to him!

414
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:56,766
I know the story isn't lost!

415
00:23:56,877 --> 00:24:00,673
I think that if he would just get his head in the
right place, he could create a masterpiece that would blow

416
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:02,858
<i>A Corpse by Evening</i> out of the water!

417
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,642
But as far as Mune is concerned,

418
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:09,755
drawing manga is something he just did once on a lark.

419
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:12,979
He did that on a lark?

420
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:16,269
It's such a waste of talent.
You think it's a shame, too, right?

421
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:19,952
But he doesn't have any desire to draw.

422
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,627
I would have been willing to do anything he
said, anything to help, if he would just agree

423
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,262
to continue working on it.

424
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,678
But I was too afraid to speak up.

425
00:24:29,346 --> 00:24:32,945
I didn't want to admit to myself
that he might not recognize the message.

426
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:36,584
And out of that denial, my expectations were born.

427
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,905
I've been carrying them around this whole time.

428
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:44,060
But wouldn't it have been a lot simpler
if you could just tell him how you feel?

429
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,181
If you had asked him?

430
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:46,752
"Kugayama.

431
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:51,579
Have you even had a chance to
read <i>The Kudryavka Sequence</i> "?

432
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,603
You really are perceptive.

433
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,621
But you know his answer.

434
00:24:57,891 --> 00:25:00,020
Oh, you're right. I do.

435
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:05,096
Mune never opened the story that
Anjo poured her heart and soul into.

436
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,703
So he couldn't have cracked the code.

437
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,416
My message didn't get through.

438
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,050
Oreki.

439
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,335
Here, thanks for this.

440
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,554
Tell your sister I said thanks, too.

441
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:26,205
Yeah.

442
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,288
What now?

443
00:25:31,412 --> 00:25:33,288
Nothing. I'll tell her for you.

444
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,504
So what should we do about these four leftover copies?

445
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,348
There's nothing much we can do.

446
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:40,517
I guess we'll just have to buy one copy each.

447
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,578
And with that... we're sold out!

448
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:02,573
All that's left is to find the
truth behind the Jumoji Caper.

449
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:06,840
And now, since there's nothing standing in
our way we can use all of our brain power!

450
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,082
Or... not.

451
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:11,159
Oh.

452
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:13,697
Actually, Hotaro already figured that one out.

453
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:15,230
Leave it to him to crack it on his own.

454
00:26:15,294 --> 00:26:16,513
Huh? Did he really?

455
00:26:16,747 --> 00:26:17,660
Is that true?

456
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,686
Well... I mean...

457
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:22,649
Yeah, why don't you tell us
all about your findings, Hotaro?

458
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,388
We can have our own little selling-out celebration.

459
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:26,747
Oh!

460
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,296
Satoshi!

461
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:31,704
Come on, buddy, why don't we all have some fun?

462
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:34,246
I am so down to party!

463
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:37,394
I didn't get to spend much time with the Classic Lit Club.

464
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:39,867
So you have to tell me everything that happened!

465
00:26:40,026 --> 00:26:42,480
Okay, why don't you guys all come over to my place, then?

466
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:43,893
All right, it's settled!

467
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:44,689
Wait, what's settled?

468
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:48,771
Yes! Time to get out of here and
cut loose! We are drinking tonight!

469
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:49,559
Now we're drinking?

470
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:51,067
Oolong tea, dummy!

471
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,356
That's the lamest thing I've ever heard.

472
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,115
Next time:

473
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:39,261
"Is the Mountain Range Clear?"
