1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:04,222
Please enjoy!

2
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:10,012
Is something wrong?

3
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,308
Uh... No.

4
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:14,802
When you asked me if I wanted to have tea
with you, I didn't know you were being literal.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,202
Don't worry. I'll get the tab.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,083
Oh.

7
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,473
Nakajo's theory didn't pan out, then?

8
00:00:24,675 --> 00:00:25,703
Nor Haba's?

9
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:27,712
Right.

10
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:29,358
Neither did Sawakiguchi's?

11
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:30,960
No, I don't believe hers did.

12
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:35,324
I see.

13
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:36,572
I'm sorry to disappoint.

14
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:38,321
You don't have to be nice about it.

15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:43,490
I'm incredibly curious.

16
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:45,801
What was so wrong about their theories?

17
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,166
Well, first, let's talk about Nakajo's hypothesis.

18
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:27,670
You see? That's why Sawakiguchi's
theory doesn't hold up to scrutiny, either.

19
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:28,797
Indeed.

20
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:34,722
Which member of your group
turned down Nakajo's idea, then?

21
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:36,378
That'd be me.

22
00:02:36,446 --> 00:02:38,907
As well as Haba and Sawakiguchi's ideas?

23
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:39,807
Yeah, that's right.

24
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:42,491
When I first approached you about this, you told me

25
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:44,391
I shouldn't expect too much from you.

26
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,854
I guess our standards of expectation differ.

27
00:02:47,116 --> 00:02:50,477
Because you proceeded to disprove
the theories our detectives put forth.

28
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:52,995
But to be honest, that was my expectation.

29
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,623
You knew I'd disprove them?

30
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,657
I never thought they'd be up to the challenge.

31
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,522
I was right.

32
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:02,402
None of them possesses the level of deductive
reasoning skills necessary to tackle something like this.

33
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:03,840
You mean the whole detective thing was a ruse?

34
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:04,849
Of course.

35
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:06,446
I'm not calling them incompetent.

36
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,409
They have their own strengths, to be sure.

37
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:13,033
But that doesn't make them useful to me in a
situation like this, and I had to interest you somehow.

38
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:13,819
Why not just...

39
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:14,812
If it weren't for you.

40
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:18,782
If it weren't for you, we would have gone
with one of their ideas, and the whole production

41
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,183
would have ended in failure.

42
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,940
And I refuse to have my name attached
to anything that isn't a success.

43
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:27,757
Man, that's pretty cold. You're heartless, aren't you?

44
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:32,712
If I must be cruel in order to get the best
product, so be it. I will do whatever it takes.

45
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,199
I had heard from three different
people that only you could fix this.

46
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:38,781
Eru Chitanda said it,

47
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,907
as well as someone from outside our school.

48
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,574
Masashi Togaito championed your prowess, too.

49
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:48,149
When I learned of your reputation, I was convinced
you had to be our detective and save our film.

50
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:49,531
There was no doubt in my mind.

51
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,683
I was after you from the very beginning.

52
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,240
Not the Classic Lit Club.

53
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,497
So, Oreki.

54
00:03:57,606 --> 00:04:02,174
After carefully weighing all the rumors about you
against your own assessment of the detectives' theories,

55
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,163
I have decided.

56
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,172
It's all true.

57
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,518
You are special.

58
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:17,728
You're gifted. A true genius.

59
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,354
So I'll ask again: will you help us?

60
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,404
Say yes.

61
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:25,816
You are the only person who can save our class project.

62
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,739
I couldn't bear it if all that hard work went to waste.

63
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,368
I'm really not a genius.

64
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,157
I just... get lucky from time to time.

65
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:36,613
That's a real shame.

66
00:04:37,093 --> 00:04:38,802
Let me tell you a little story.

67
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,711
It might change your perspective a bit.

68
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:44,492
Once, there was a sports team with a benchwarmer.

69
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,825
The benchwarmer did her very best to get
herself off the bench and onto the field,

70
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:51,669
but all her efforts were in vain.

71
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:56,627
Try as she might, her hard work was no match
for the athletic ability of the other team members.

72
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,980
There was one player in particular
whose natural talent was undeniable.

73
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,437
Compared to our benchwarmer, the
difference was like night and day.

74
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:11,268
At one match, the talented girl performed
exceptionally well, even for her, and was named the MVP.

75
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:13,994
Interviewers flocked to her, hungry for a quote.

76
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,171
One said, "You're amazing!
We're dying to know your secrets!"

77
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:18,935
She answered humbly.

78
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:22,156
"Secrets? Oh, no, I just got lucky!"

79
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,739
I believe the poor benchwarmer took great
offense upon hearing such an inconsiderate remark.

80
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:29,622
Do you?

81
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,389
It's not wrong to acknowledge who you really are.

82
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,676
If you don't,

83
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,372
you make fools out of those who praise you.

84
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,739
Is she right? Am I special?

85
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:49,626
Do I deny myself credit for being who I am?

86
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,324
If so, then why?

87
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:54,972
Do I think it's wrong to believe in my talent?

88
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,863
All right, Irisu.

89
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:10,410
My answer...

90
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,265
You're going to school of your own accord
during summer vacation? Are pigs flying?

91
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,496
Do you have to?

92
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:21,685
No, but am I not allowed to go to school if I want to?

93
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:22,685
You are.

94
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:24,695
It's just not like you, that's all.

95
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:27,293
I'm fulfilling a personal request from Irisu.

96
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,799
I'm going to solve the murder in Class 2-F's film.

97
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:32,457
What? No way! Who are you?

98
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,636
I am Hotaro Oreki, the hard-working teenage detective.

99
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:37,324
Did you say "hard-working"?

100
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,424
This is spooky.

101
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:38,892
Hmph.

102
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,936
Seriously, I never thought I would see the day.

103
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:44,241
Are you doing this because of Chitanda again?

104
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:44,931
No.

105
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,550
Then, what's your motivation?

106
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,306
"If I don't have to, I'm not going to," remember?

107
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,594
That is your motto. Am I correct?

108
00:06:54,853 --> 00:06:55,980
Satoshi.

109
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:56,688
Hm?

110
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:58,729
Ah...

111
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:02,878
Please be honest.

112
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,881
Do you believe that there's
anything which only you can do?

113
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:09,820
No way.

114
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,250
Really?

115
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:12,848
Don't you remember?

116
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:14,858
I don't have any special talents.

117
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,082
Here, check it out.

118
00:07:16,183 --> 00:07:18,320
I think of myself as a Sherlockian.

119
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:21,435
But I know deep down that I couldn't really be one.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,378
I don't have the kind of iron-clad
constitution that could handle diving headlong

121
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,516
into the murky depths of obscure knowledge.

122
00:07:27,556 --> 00:07:28,991
I'm nothing but an impostor.

123
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:32,465
If Mayaka suddenly took a
serious interest in Sherlock Holmes,

124
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:36,470
I guarantee this: She'd surpass me in three months, flat.

125
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,741
I'm a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

126
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:42,246
I'm a serious dabbler, that's all.

127
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,769
I get my passport stamped and I go on my way.

128
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:47,471
I'm an expert at nothing, but that's all right.

129
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:49,468
But, I get it.

130
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,832
Irisu roped you into this somehow.

131
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,457
Even so, you still doubt your aptitude.

132
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:57,241
Which is normal, I suppose.

133
00:07:57,317 --> 00:07:59,199
Don't you have any doubts about yourself?

134
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:00,104
Even a little?

135
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:03,076
I don't. I know I'm average.

136
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:03,759
Let's go.

137
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,309
Mayaka is probably at school already.

138
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,374
I wanna say hi.

139
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,449
Satoshi!

140
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:09,003
Hm?

141
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:14,491
What I think may not matter, one way or the other,
but, in my opinion, you're way better than just average.

142
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:16,877
If you wanted to be a Sherlockian someday,

143
00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:20,380
I believe that you would be one
of the finest Japan had to offer.

144
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:28,319
There are about a million things I'd
rather aspire to than being a Sherlockian.

145
00:08:29,492 --> 00:08:31,002
Though I've gotta admit...

146
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:34,212
I couldn't envy you more.

147
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,816
Just so you know.

148
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:45,882
What?! It's summer vacation and Oreki
still came to school of his own accord?

149
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:47,355
You got a problem with that?

150
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,386
It's creepy.

151
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,429
I'm sure it foretells some kind of apocalyptic disaster.

152
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,841
Look, I decided to help solve the mystery.

153
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,610
Seriously? How come?

154
00:08:58,116 --> 00:08:58,914
He, he.

155
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:02,337
I bet Irisu seduced you into it somehow, didn't she?

156
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:04,666
You nailed it. Sharp as a tack!

157
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:06,438
Whatever.

158
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:09,507
Enough about me, what happened after you left yesterday?

159
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,824
You mean with Chi?

160
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:13,001
Well, I know she made it home all right.

161
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:14,701
But when I called her this morning,

162
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:16,382
she was in bed with a hangover.

163
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:17,407
That's funny.

164
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,061
And all from those chocolates.

165
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:20,245
Ahem.

166
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:21,731
Well, anyway.

167
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,464
I think it would help if we watched the movie again.

168
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:29,485
Kaito!

169
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,864
Th-There's blood everywhere!

170
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,038
Oh, no. What is that?

171
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:49,444
Wow, Kaito's severed arm looks so lifelike
in that shot. I'd swear that it was real!

172
00:09:49,574 --> 00:09:53,432
I think the prop team is the most
talented part of this entire production.

173
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,005
Oh, no.

174
00:09:59,427 --> 00:10:03,108
It sure doesn't seem like a very
complicated set-up from my perspective.

175
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:06,500
That's true. They did an excellent
job of making it look simple, huh?

176
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:07,756
No, they didn't.

177
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:12,125
The reason the setting looks so simple doesn't
have anything to do with the filmmakers at all.

178
00:10:12,188 --> 00:10:12,848
What, then?

179
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:15,605
Here's my assessment:

180
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,363
Anything good in this film is a complete accident.

181
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,632
They don't know what they are doing,
so the mystery ends up falling flat.

182
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,327
Damn.

183
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:26,712
These students from Class 2-F have
decided to participate in the Kanyasai.

184
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:27,618
You're right.

185
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:32,798
The first time I saw it, I assumed at this point
it was a regular documentary, not a murder mystery.

186
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,096
The production values are extremely weak, overall.

187
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:37,376
Like, which part?

188
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:39,298
The camerawork, for starters.

189
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:40,742
Yeah, I agree.

190
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,403
Okay.

191
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,720
How would you shoot it, Ibara?

192
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:44,414
Well, I'm glad you asked.

193
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:48,093
Let's see. Where was it?

194
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:51,081
Hold on. Right here.

195
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,874
Wouldn't it be better to use a wide shot here?

196
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,848
Just to give some perspective on the size of
the room and how small the characters are in it?

197
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,070
Good point.

198
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,508
And, also...

199
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:01,632
This part.

200
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:03,266
Hey, Sugimura!

201
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:04,746
What did you find up there?

202
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:06,654
Well, it's pretty clean, mostly.

203
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,107
The rooms in this wing...

204
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:09,706
I think it would be smarter to shoot

205
00:11:09,731 --> 00:11:14,429
from Sugimura's perspective, so the audience
could see that the lobby's in full view from up there.

206
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,982
If the viewers only see him from down there,
there's no way they would be able to tell that.

207
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,282
Okay.

208
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,866
What else is there?

209
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:22,824
You know...

210
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,131
How 'bout we not?

211
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:25,342
What, how come?

212
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,309
You'll never stop.

213
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:30,044
Plus, criticizing the camerawork won't solve the mystery.

214
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:31,268
Now, now.

215
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,286
There might be some value in criticism.

216
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,614
There you are! Finally!

217
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:37,773
Uh... Ah, ha...

218
00:11:37,903 --> 00:11:39,924
So this is where you've been hiding!

219
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,293
Yamauchi! How's it going?

220
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:42,819
Whoa!

221
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:44,674
Hey, man, no need to resort to violence!

222
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:45,757
It's for your own good!

223
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:46,966
You should be thanking me!

224
00:11:46,991 --> 00:11:47,728
Come on!

225
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,890
I've got a ton of other things to do today!

226
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,824
Dummy! Omichi's gonna shred you!

227
00:11:51,882 --> 00:11:54,490
Don't you even care if you fail the class?

228
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:55,856
Go with him.

229
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:58,017
You do need those remedial lessons.

230
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:01,366
No! Solving Hongo's mystery is just as important as math!

231
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:04,142
Come on, Hotaro, just pull the answer out of thin air!

232
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:06,502
What are you even talkin' about, you moron?

233
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:07,932
Oh, it's fascinating...

234
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:10,817
No! Let me stay!

235
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:14,264
I have to know the answer! The answer!

236
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:15,616
He put up a good fight.

237
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,282
What is wrong with that boy?

238
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:19,378
He's not giving up!

239
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,213
I'm sorry, my friends.

240
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,313
I'm a slave to circumstances beyond my control.

241
00:12:24,603 --> 00:12:26,069
Though it's come to this.

242
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:26,857
Fukube!

243
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:28,921
Think of this notebook as me and I shall be with you.

244
00:12:28,946 --> 00:12:30,507
Stand up! Let's go!

245
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,726
Okay! I'm coming. Don't drag me!

246
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:33,800
Ridiculous.

247
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:34,866
Well then,

248
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,366
I guess I'd better go, too.

249
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,168
Really?

250
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,549
Don't give me that look.

251
00:12:39,574 --> 00:12:43,905
Helping Irisu is one thing, but I'm
making no sacrifices for the likes of you.

252
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,032
Oh, yeah?

253
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,574
Such attitude.

254
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:48,498
I have library duty today.

255
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:50,969
If you'd told me before, I could have cancelled it.

256
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,494
It's your own fault for springing this on us.

257
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:55,710
That said...

258
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,269
I'm sorry. I mean it.

259
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:08,200
Okay.

260
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,507
Let's split up and explore the building!

261
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:12,047
Hey!

262
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:14,516
Damn it! He's dead!

263
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:17,130
Th-There's blood everywhere!

264
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:20,825
There has to be a set of keys
lying around this place somewhere.

265
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,040
I've got it.

266
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,397
So, that's it.

267
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,786
That's what she intended.

268
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:00,668
Come in.

269
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,866
First, I have to know.

270
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,320
Did you figure it out?

271
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,250
Okay. Then let me hear it.

272
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:14,349
Right.

273
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:18,072
It goes without saying that the locked room is key here.

274
00:14:18,097 --> 00:14:19,184
No pun intended.

275
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,383
At the time he died... I mean...

276
00:14:21,566 --> 00:14:23,998
at the point in which he was murdered in the movie,

277
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,676
none of the others could have entered
or left that room without being noticed.

278
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,282
There's nothing to be nervous about here.

279
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:29,693
Uh...

280
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,506
The stage left wing was also locked.

281
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,285
Damn it! He's dead!

282
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:40,436
The window, which is the only
other way out, is difficult to open.

283
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:45,797
That means it's not possible for the killer
to have come or gone by any way except the door.

284
00:14:46,157 --> 00:14:47,625
So how'd they get in the room?

285
00:14:48,366 --> 00:14:50,674
I can't tell from the video if there's some rig

286
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,780
built into the door that springs the lock.

287
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:57,103
So it's safe to assume that the killer
used the master key to let themselves in.

288
00:14:57,345 --> 00:15:00,043
However, Sugimura was able to see the lobby.

289
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:06,390
Because of Sugimura, no one could have entered the
stage right hallway, which creates a second locked room.

290
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:10,688
They couldn't have gotten the master key
from out of the office and gone down that hall

291
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:12,241
without going through the lobby.

292
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:13,320
He'd spot them.

293
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:16,132
So what possible explanations does that leave?

294
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,889
If none of the six could have done it
without being seen, there's just one answer.

295
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:23,115
A seventh character must have committed the murder.

296
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:26,603
Interesting. Sawakiguchi said that.

297
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,620
Yes.

298
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:31,824
When she first brought it up to us, I thought
it was ridiculous, and I wrote it off completely.

299
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:33,699
It didn't seem like a viable option.

300
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:37,170
But then she said that Hongo was
trying to cast a seventh character.

301
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,910
Remembering that piece is what ultimately convinced me.

302
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,865
But...

303
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:44,241
Hongo had written the rest of the
film's script to be pretty straightforward.

304
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:47,760
It seemed unlikely that she'd
introduce a new character at that point.

305
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:48,841
However,

306
00:15:48,896 --> 00:15:51,978
we noticed a few odd occurrences
at other points in the film.

307
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,521
Satoshi pointed them out for me in his notes.

308
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:59,741
"Konosu finds the floorplan. It seems illuminated.

309
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,824
I think it's lit by a flashlight."

310
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:02,939
"I saw it again.

311
00:16:03,157 --> 00:16:05,366
In the part where they go looking for Kaito."

312
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:08,221
"The hall is pitch black. Can't see a thing.

313
00:16:08,407 --> 00:16:10,199
Suddenly, a flashlight, again."

314
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,741
What's weird about a flashlight?

315
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:12,534
Nothing.

316
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,983
Except that none of the six kids is ever seen
holding one at any other point in the whole movie.

317
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,923
If you look closely at the scene
where they discover Kaito's body,

318
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,282
immediately after the illumination in the hallway,

319
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,912
you can clearly see that no one has a flashlight.

320
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,074
There was enough time for them to have hidden it,

321
00:16:27,157 --> 00:16:28,407
but why would they do that?

322
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:29,956
There's no good reason to.

323
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:31,768
I know, I know.

324
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,040
You assumed it's scene lighting, but hold that thought.

325
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:37,171
Just keep everything I said about
the flashlight in mind for later.

326
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:38,679
There's something else.

327
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,667
And don't get offended. Know
it's coming from a true film buff.

328
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,393
She complains that the movie is boring.

329
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:45,783
And it's poorly produced.

330
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:49,087
The camerawork in particular
lacked any innovation or skill.

331
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:50,677
But what if that was intentional?

332
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:52,338
A clue for the viewers?

333
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:54,236
How was it shot?

334
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,386
The camera appears to be in the same
place as the other six for the whole movie.

335
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:00,189
Well, then,

336
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:01,746
it seems like you've figured it out.

337
00:17:02,517 --> 00:17:03,642
I think I have.

338
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:04,528
Do you mean...

339
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:08,586
...that the cameraman is the
seventh character and the killer?

340
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,761
Mm-hm.

341
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,116
There were seven characters
from the beginning of the film.

342
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:17,754
The six that you see on screen the entire
time, and the person behind the camera shooting.

343
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:18,811
That makes seven.

344
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:20,273
Now, watch closely.

345
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:23,046
In some of the scenes, the actors
seem to be aware of the camera.

346
00:17:23,086 --> 00:17:24,672
They pay subtle attention to him.

347
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,004
They look at him occasionally, though not very much.

348
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,727
Calling him the cameraman is confusing.

349
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,134
Let's rename him the seventh man.

350
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,002
Now remember the flashlight.

351
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,216
It wouldn't be odd for him to be carrying
one, if it's his job to chronicle the experience.

352
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:42,557
The poor quality of the camera work, and
the fact that none of the scenes were shot

353
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:44,378
from multiple angles makes sense.

354
00:17:44,457 --> 00:17:47,793
If the guy behind the camera is a
character in the story, that's expected.

355
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:48,764
Also...

356
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:50,710
and this part is really important...

357
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:54,236
When the characters split up to look
around, the camera stayed in the lobby

358
00:17:54,261 --> 00:17:55,985
after all six of the others had left.

359
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,917
There's that weird, empty moment, and the scene fades out.

360
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,292
So check it out.

361
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:04,199
After the others were gone, the seventh
man stopped filming for a few minutes, left.

362
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,726
Came back, started rolling, and waited for them.

363
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,022
And so, it was a really simple crime.

364
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:14,199
The seventh man made sure they were gone, stopped
his camera, and ran to the office to get the master key.

365
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:17,816
Then, while the others were busy
elsewhere, he found Kaito and killed him.

366
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:22,194
After he committed the murder, he used
the master key to lock the room behind him.

367
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,022
Then he returned quickly to the
lobby and waited for the others.

368
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,933
That is the conclusion I drew.

369
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:33,428
If Hongo hadn't already cast a seventh actor,

370
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:36,583
then I suggest you try to find one as soon as possible.

371
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:38,911
Two questions.

372
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:43,657
First, if your theory is true, the fact that no one
ever talks to the seventh man or acknowledges him much

373
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:45,671
seems a little awkward, doesn't it?

374
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:49,231
Maybe Hongo was using that as a way to establish a motive.

375
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:52,662
The seventh man could be an outcast,
someone that others usually ignore.

376
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:57,152
As a result, he never felt confident speaking
up when they were around, hence his silence.

377
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,485
Next question.

378
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:03,817
If your hypothesis is correct, wouldn't the other
characters figure it out eventually, the same as you did?

379
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:07,209
They would all suspect the seventh
man because he'd stayed in the lobby.

380
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:10,714
Also, the "second locked room"
part of your theory is still intact.

381
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:15,481
His exit from the lobby and his return after the
murder would have been in public view the whole time.

382
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:19,095
In which case, everyone would know
who the murderer was immediately.

383
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,100
I don't mean to be rude when I say this, but,

384
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:26,000
what does it matter? Like, who cares?

385
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,924
It's not important whether the
characters know who the killer is or not.

386
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:33,988
As long as the audience is intrigued by the
mystery, don't you think that's the point here?

387
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:37,988
That may be the reason the film doesn't
have a detective character in the first place.

388
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:41,190
The movie doesn't deal with the
people in the story figuring it out.

389
00:19:41,317 --> 00:19:43,502
They know who among them would be the killer.

390
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:57,502
Congratulations.

391
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:57,884
Huh?

392
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:01,013
I believe that you have just solved Hongo's mystery.

393
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,414
It's an astoundingly bold approach.

394
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,941
That's for certain, but it
corresponds to all of the facts,

395
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:10,023
so I can't imagine there's any
legitimate reason to dispute it.

396
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:13,288
Anyway, thank you.

397
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:15,449
Now we can resume our production.

398
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,866
I guess my assumption about
you has proven correct after all.

399
00:20:24,996 --> 00:20:28,907
You do have formidable skill.
The power no one else possesses.

400
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,934
Uh, thank you.

401
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:33,826
That's nice to hear. I'm very flattered.

402
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:35,080
I mean it.

403
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,989
So, what do you think the title of our film should be?

404
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,195
Oh, the title?

405
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:44,606
Off the top of your head. I'm sure everyone will
approve, and I know I would like anything you dream up.

406
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,765
Huh.

407
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:48,953
Well, let me think.

408
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,194
In light of the culprit...

409
00:20:52,745 --> 00:20:56,238
How do you feel about, <i>A Blind Spot to All</i>?

410
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:59,073
That's a good idea.

411
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,528
I think it's the one.

412
00:21:11,699 --> 00:21:12,985
Home run.

413
00:21:15,934 --> 00:21:16,745
Good morning!

414
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:17,571
Good morning!

415
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,740
All the third years, please listen up.

416
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:22,123
It's October, time for everyone's favorite:

417
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,609
the cultural festival!

418
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:39,378
It's strange. How could anyone have
gotten into that room without us seeing?

419
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,477
I don't know. But I think...

420
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,757
...there's one person who could've. Did you murder Kaito?

421
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:46,283
You did it, didn't you?

422
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:47,460
Murderer!

423
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:49,418
You're gonna pay for this!

424
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,773
Turned out great, huh?

425
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,625
You can't run away from this!

426
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:57,264
He pulled it off, didn't he?

427
00:21:57,343 --> 00:21:58,716
Man, I gotta tell ya,

428
00:21:58,741 --> 00:22:00,116
I was amazed by that surprise ending!

429
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,832
It's the real-life Kaito!

430
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,873
Hey, you're the guy!

431
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:07,345
Everybody's saying you're the
mastermind behind the whole thing.

432
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,133
Yeah. Sure.

433
00:22:09,449 --> 00:22:11,683
Man, that ending was genius, kid!

434
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,027
Sure surprised me!

435
00:22:13,228 --> 00:22:15,257
Hey! It's The Great Detective!

436
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:16,506
"Great detective"?

437
00:22:17,076 --> 00:22:18,701
Yeah! Good work!

438
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:21,591
Though, I have to say, it's sad that
when the seventh character is revealed

439
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:23,757
to be the killer, the others turn violent, too.

440
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:25,245
They should have just turned him in.

441
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:26,404
Yeah.

442
00:22:26,493 --> 00:22:28,507
Well, anyway, thanks for everything.

443
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:29,249
See ya!

444
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:30,522
Cool.

445
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,849
Listen, Nakajo...

446
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:33,653
What's up?

447
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,448
Your pit stains are out of control.

448
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,991
That arm was worth all the work we put into it.

449
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:38,856
Tch.

450
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:41,446
I guess Haba wasn't satisfied with the ending.

451
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:42,546
Hotaro!

452
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:43,297
Huh?

453
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:44,362
We saw the film.

454
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:45,594
What did you think?

455
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:46,879
It's pretty good.

456
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,818
It was very interesting.

457
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:50,924
Who would've have pinned it on the cameraman?

458
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,481
The other day when we met.

459
00:22:52,526 --> 00:22:54,015
Had you already figured it all out?

460
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:56,755
No, at that point, I hadn't quite come up with it yet.

461
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:57,525
Really.

462
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:58,304
Huh?

463
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,052
Weird.

464
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:00,711
She doesn't seem surprised at all.

465
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,373
Then again, it is Mayaka. What'd I expect?

466
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,373
Hey, Oreki.

467
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:05,812
Hm? Yeah?

468
00:23:06,949 --> 00:23:07,664
Listen.

469
00:23:09,782 --> 00:23:10,961
I-I thought...

470
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,018
I'll tell you later.

471
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:18,468
Well, you did a great job, as usual, my friend.

472
00:23:18,616 --> 00:23:20,851
And as for the Empress. She's happy.

473
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:24,672
Plus the audience loved the element of
surprise with the seventh man at the end.

474
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,637
Oreki...

475
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,282
There's something I have to ask.

476
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:32,307
What's that?

477
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:34,087
What are you doing?

478
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:37,417
Now you're solely responsible for that ending, aren't you?

479
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,139
That's right.

480
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:38,972
All of it?

481
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:39,752
Mostly.

482
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:41,548
Hm...

483
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:45,576
Then how do you account for what Haba
said when we met with the detectives?

484
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,427
Haba?

485
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:48,674
It's just...

486
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:57,620
They didn't use a rope anywhere in that
movie, and Hongo specifically asked him for one.

487
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:37,515
Next time:

488
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:39,880
"Credit Roll of Fools."
