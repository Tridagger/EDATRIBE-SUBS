1
00:00:01,998 --> 00:00:04,433
<i>March 1st, 18 years ago.</i>

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,538
<i>On my way home, I saw Kayo standing alone in the park.</i>

3
00:00:09,138 --> 00:00:11,693
<i>I guess it was a little before 6:00.</i>

4
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:16,203
<i>That night I was on my way to the hideout.</i>

5
00:00:16,678 --> 00:00:19,414
<i>I think it was to try and find my gloves.</i>

6
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:22,628
<i>But I don't remember if I found them there or not.</i>

7
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:27,340
<i>After I left, I saw Yuuki sitting by himself on the bank,</i>

8
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:28,849
<i>looking out at the river.</i>

9
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,503
<i>On the way back home,</i>

10
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:34,076
<i>I took a shortcut that took me by the park again.</i>

11
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:38,410
<i>But this time when I looked in, Kayo was gone.</i>

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,870
Let's talk about averages.

13
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:49,711
<i>A week from now, Kayo will be the first
victim in a series of kidnappings and murders.</i>

14
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:51,791
<i>Day X.</i>

15
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:54,675
<i>If I can get her to survive March 1st</i>

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,140
<i>and spend the 2nd with me at my birthday party,</i>

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,317
<i>that should be enough to change her future.</i>

18
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,152
<i>I'm not gonna let her die.</i>

19
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:39,443
Good morning, you sleepy head.

20
00:02:39,585 --> 00:02:40,752
Morning.

21
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:43,056
Up and at 'em. Food's almost ready.

22
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:44,974
OK.

23
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:46,939
Thanks for breakfast.

24
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,222
Uh, hey, Mom?

25
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,240
Hmm?

26
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,396
I was thinking of going out this Saturday.

27
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,621
Like on a date?

28
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,357
No! I was gonna go to the
Science Center with some friends.

29
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:03,065
Oh, well. If it were a date, I'd give you spending cash.

30
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,362
<i>Shit, for real?</i>

31
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:06,866
It is a date, isn't it?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,619
Mm‐hmm.

33
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,883
Then bring her by. I'd love to meet her.

34
00:03:09,908 --> 00:03:11,595
We can have hotpot or something.

35
00:03:11,742 --> 00:03:14,220
Actually, I invited Kayo to the party.

36
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:17,812
Oh. Kayo from a few streets over, huh?

37
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,692
<i>Damn, she's good at getting info out of people.</i>

38
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:23,024
You can go. Just be safe.

39
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:25,464
Thanks, Mom.

40
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:27,366
Hurry up and finish your breakfast, kiddo.

41
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,101
Mm‐hmm.

42
00:03:28,835 --> 00:03:30,964
Stand... bow.

43
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,383
Bye!

44
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,174
Liveman's gonna be on. Cool, huh?

45
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,643
What's a falcon? It's a bird, duh!

46
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,472
You're so smart.

47
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:43,135
<i>This Saturday, Kayo's not staying home.</i>

48
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,041
<i>I'm gonna take her away from her mom and the beatings.</i>

49
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:48,967
Mr. Yashiro?

50
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:49,574
Um, sir?

51
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,432
What's up, guys?

52
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,637
Can you explain this? I don't get it.

53
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:55,481
Sure. Hmm. That's a tough one.

54
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:58,230
What a bunch of flirty little tramps.

55
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,115
Ecch.

56
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:03,725
What are you talking about? It's not
like you never did that too, you know.

57
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,505
Instead of dissing him, go up
there and show him who's boss.

58
00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:10,594
What's "dis" mean? You trying to sound cool?

59
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,575
<i>Oh! Gotta watch what I say.</i>

60
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,130
The teacher doesn't care about
me anymore, he thinks I'm a thief.

61
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:18,432
Bet you do, too.

62
00:04:19,544 --> 00:04:20,865
Not that I care.

63
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,070
Hey, guys, I got an idea.

64
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,560
Oh, yeah? What is it?

65
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:32,098
Um, let's go to the Science Center on Saturday.

66
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:33,880
I'll ask Kayo to go, too.

67
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,667
Yeah, that's a great idea!

68
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,820
Ohhh!

69
00:04:36,845 --> 00:04:37,865
I can't make it.

70
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,938
Sorry, but I've already made plans that day.

71
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,682
Oh, really?

72
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:43,040
Uh, same for me, too, dude.

73
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,639
I, uh, got some important things need doing.

74
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:49,306
Yeah, what he said. I'd like
to go, but I can't either. Sorry.

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,544
Yeah, me too.

76
00:04:51,322 --> 00:04:51,754
Oh.

77
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,463
It's better if it's just you and Kayo anyway.

78
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:55,742
See ya.

79
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,072
Satoru, everything OK?

80
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:01,612
Oh, yeah.

81
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:06,286
I told them I couldn't hang out
Saturday 'cause I had a date with you.

82
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,106
<i>What a lie.</i>

83
00:05:08,905 --> 00:05:10,452
<i>I did it again.</i>

84
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,981
But... my mom wants me to get home early Saturday, so...

85
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,382
I just wanna take you someplace cool.

86
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:21,170
I'll ask her and get permission.

87
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,363
Kenya.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,647
Could I see you in the faculty office for a sec?

89
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:31,357
No way. You kids are too young to go out on a date.

90
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:34,665
But it's more like a field trip. We'll be learning stuff.

91
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:37,086
You can stay home and learn stuff.

92
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:40,466
Besides, Kayo helps me around the house Saturdays.

93
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,301
Oh, yeah, with what?

94
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:44,636
<i>Blowing off steam? Your right hook?</i>

95
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:47,629
Little smart ass, I don't have to tell you a damn thing.

96
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,459
I just wanna know why you don't want Kayo to go with me.

97
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,395
I got a zillion reasons why.

98
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,580
First, you guys are too young to be dating.

99
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,491
Second, who's responsible if something happens? You?

100
00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,652
<i>Don't even go there with me, bitch.</i>

101
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:01,992
What's your problem?

102
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,160
What do you get out of taking her anywhere?

103
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:06,122
She's just a gloomy little girl.

104
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,275
I'm not getting anything. All I want's to keep her safe!

105
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,629
Safe, huh?

106
00:06:11,149 --> 00:06:13,471
What do you think you're keeping her safe from?

107
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,634
You her knight in shining armor?

108
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,880
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

109
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:19,513
<i>Now she knows I know she beats on her.</i>

110
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:24,159
What do you want to do, Kayo? You wanna go out with him?

111
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:31,535
Uggh! You're not going anywhere, you slut!

112
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:32,643
Mom!

113
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:34,536
Watch it, Ms. Hinazuki.

114
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:37,656
You shouldn't say nasty things
like that about your daughter.

115
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,152
Ms. Fujinuma, I...

116
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,049
This isn't any of your business.

117
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,725
Actually, half of this is my business.

118
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:50,151
A trip to the Science Center
can be very educational for a kid.

119
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:52,130
Don't you think we should encourage that?

120
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:53,725
We are their parents.

121
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,989
I'm a single mom, too, so I know how tough it can get.

122
00:06:58,355 --> 00:07:00,159
Come by sometime and we'll talk.

123
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:04,826
Kayo, get inside.

124
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:06,075
OK.

125
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,101
So, Saturday, I'll see you then.

126
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:15,108
Did I screw everything up?

127
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,363
No. You were great.

128
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,200
Guess it's lucky I showed up when I did.

129
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,871
I got off work early and saw you,
so naturally I had to follow you.

130
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,604
What do you mean "naturally"?

131
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,164
Oh, nothing. I'm just kidding, is all.

132
00:07:30,244 --> 00:07:33,587
Anyway, you don't have to worry about Kayo tonight.

133
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,349
Did you notice how nice her clothes were?

134
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:39,805
Her mom goes to a lot of trouble
to make her look presentable.

135
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,822
Do you know what's going on over there?

136
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,286
I didn't, but after what I just heard and saw,

137
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,002
I have my suspicions.

138
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:50,385
<i>My mom wasn't a reporter for nothing.</i>

139
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:52,884
Kayo's a cutie, isn't she?

140
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:53,710
Uh...

141
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,965
<i>Dude, you're 29!</i>

142
00:07:57,806 --> 00:07:59,972
Hang in there, kiddo, for her.

143
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:00,893
I will.

144
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:06,045
<i>It's Saturday, February the 27th.</i>

145
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,790
<i>It's sunny and clear, and for the last couple days,</i>

146
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:13,382
<i>Kayo's mom hasn't beaten her up, just like my mom said.</i>

147
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,287
Lookit, he's my friend.

148
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:19,021
You're an idiot.

149
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:22,962
Isn't this place the coolest? I love it!

150
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,463
I think we're the only ones here.

151
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:29,929
When it's quiet like this, I pretend I snuck in.

152
00:08:30,564 --> 00:08:33,306
Then, if someone comes, I hide from them.

153
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,077
<i>Huh. She didn't call me an idiot.</i>

154
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,035
Take a look inside this thing.

155
00:08:43,953 --> 00:08:46,613
You wanna check out the next show in the planetarium?

156
00:08:56,074 --> 00:08:58,627
We already saw enough stars on the mountain.

157
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,150
Yeah, I guess.

158
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:05,773
Hey, I have to use the bathroom.

159
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,700
OK. I'll be here.

160
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,693
<i>What the heck was that feeling back there?</i>

161
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:19,051
<i>It was like déjà vu.</i>

162
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,103
<i>I remember coming here a lot,</i>

163
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:24,989
<i>but this is my first time with Kayo.</i>

164
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,652
I'm back.

165
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:37,997
Satoru, thanks for inviting me to come today.

166
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,834
Did you know that I like to come here, too?

167
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,627
<i>Wait, did I?</i>

168
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,775
<i>Is that why I chose it?</i>

169
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:48,547
<i>Or... is this someplace special for me/you,</i>

170
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,483
<i>'cause like I/you wanna make manga and stuff?</i>

171
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:58,057
<i>We talked about the same thing 18 years ago.</i>

172
00:09:58,455 --> 00:09:59,874
<i>Now I remember.</i>

173
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:03,053
<i>I came here by myself and ran into Kayo.</i>

174
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,382
What's wrong?

175
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:08,061
Oh, uh, maybe...

176
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,522
<i>Am I just repeating things?</i>

177
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:18,702
<i>Have I been doing it unconsciously this
whole time and... not changing the future at all?</i>

178
00:10:29,818 --> 00:10:32,285
Hey, Kayo, lemme carry that.

179
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:33,544
OK.

180
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:37,341
<i>But there's so much that has changed
because of what I did different.</i>

181
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,420
<i>I</i> can <i>change the future.</i>

182
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:40,653
<i>I can.</i>

183
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,836
Satoru...

184
00:10:44,618 --> 00:10:46,812
I'm glad I had the guts to come today.

185
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,008
Mm‐hmm.

186
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:53,083
Hey, guys.

187
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:54,100
Hi, Kayo.

188
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,212
What's up?

189
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,362
I finished the stuff I had to do early.

190
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:59,234
Sorry we got here so late.

191
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,754
<i>There, it changed.</i>

192
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,544
Is it OK we came?

193
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,292
Yeah, of course it is.

194
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:07,250
Right, Kayo?

195
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:07,973
Mm‐hmm.

196
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:10,212
Hey, wanna hold our coats, too?

197
00:11:21,535 --> 00:11:23,289
Hi, Satoru. Good morning.

198
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,992
Oh, hey, Kayo. Morning.

199
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:29,182
<i>Yes! She's here on time on a Monday.</i>

200
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,710
<i>Damn, you're pretty.</i>

201
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,368
Uh...

202
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:35,946
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

203
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,267
No way!

204
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:39,701
Satoru's so rad!

205
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,216
They're gonna get married!

206
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,411
They gotta get engaged first, ya lame‐brain.

207
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,357
What's "engaged" mean?

208
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:45,225
Congrats, you guys.

209
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,036
Settle down. Let's do some learning today.

210
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,428
<i>Tomorrow's the day Kayo disappears.</i>

211
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,541
<i>March 1st.</i>

212
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:58,560
The moment of truth.

213
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,735
Later, Hiromi.

214
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,382
Yep, see you tomorrow.

215
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,227
Hey, Kayo, wanna walk to school together?

216
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
I could swing by your place.

217
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,060
OK.

218
00:12:11,783 --> 00:12:12,503
Mom.

219
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,346
Hello.

220
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:20,423
I'll come and get you tomorrow morning. Bye!

221
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:27,570
See you later, Mom.

222
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,537
OK.

223
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,695
<i>I left the house a little early.</i>

224
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:35,432
<i>It's March 1st, 1988.</i>

225
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:39,167
<i>Kayo was kidnapped 18 years ago today.</i>

226
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,352
It's me, Kayo.

227
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,677
<i>But things are different now.</i>

228
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,299
Good morning, Satoru.

229
00:12:51,464 --> 00:12:52,580
Good morning.

230
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:56,750
<i>No one's gonna hurt her.</i>

231
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,225
Bye, Ms. Hinazuki.

232
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,771
<i>A lot of things have changed
between this time 18 years ago and now.</i>

233
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,552
They're holding hands and everything now.

234
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:15,912
<i>Kayo was targeted because she
was always alone at the park.</i>

235
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,900
<i>But she's not alone anymore.</i>

236
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:21,230
You guys are all still coming over tomorrow night, right?

237
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:21,721
Yeah.

238
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:22,174
Of course.

239
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:22,700
Yep.

240
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:25,880
<i>She's had friends to hang out with the past few days.</i>

241
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:29,668
I know. Wanna go play a game?

242
00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:30,227
Uh...

243
00:13:30,774 --> 00:13:33,154
<i>And today she's with me.</i>

244
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,222
I kind of wanted to get home early today.

245
00:13:36,261 --> 00:13:38,814
Come on, don't be like that. We'll have fun.

246
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,524
OK.

247
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:41,936
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

248
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,434
Looks like I won again.

249
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,820
You're good.

250
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:47,002
<i>This sucks.</i>

251
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:51,765
Satoru, I should be getting home.

252
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:55,245
Yeah. It's getting late.

253
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,073
It's snowing.

254
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:03,188
I'll come by tomorrow, too.

255
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:05,055
See you in the morning!

256
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:06,548
Bye.

257
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,112
<i>I said it loud like that on purpose.</i>

258
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,798
<i>That way, everyone heard me.</i>

259
00:15:14,316 --> 00:15:18,750
<i>Kayo, her mom, and anyone else who might be out there.</i>

260
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,209
<i>They know I'm here now.</i>

261
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:30,440
<i>Day X is almost over. It's too good to be true.</i>

262
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:39,839
<i>I'm such a dumb ass.</i>

263
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:41,999
<i>Like this is gonna change anything.</i>

264
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,439
<i>I did it!</i>

265
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:58,535
<i>The day's over.</i>

266
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:00,822
<i>I changed history.</i>

267
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,533
Good morning, Mom.

268
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,606
What the...? It's not even 6:00.

269
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:11,852
I know. Bye!

270
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,168
What about breakfast?!

271
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,483
<i>I couldn't sleep after I got home.</i>

272
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,552
<i>I wanted to see Kayo again, no matter how early it was.</i>

273
00:16:37,855 --> 00:16:39,402
Morning. Sleep well?

274
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,954
You're an idiot.

275
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,817
Are you guys still on for tonight?

276
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,149
Yeah, dude, you know it.

277
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,950
If there's one thing I like
more than cake, it's birthday cake.

278
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:53,262
Cool. You guys want to hit the market with me...?

279
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,269
Hey!Satoru, Kayo. I need your
help putting these boxes away.

280
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,231
Huh? Can't it wait till tomorrow?

281
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,577
It sort of figures.

282
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:06,822
We blew off the last time we had cleaning duties.

283
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,850
I guess. Man, this is heavy.

284
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,346
Some friends they turned out to be.

285
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,740
Those doofuses totally bailed on us.

286
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,954
That'll be 5,000 yen, please.

287
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,901
OK.

288
00:17:21,724 --> 00:17:25,483
<i>Wait a sec. It cost 5,000 back then, too.</i>

289
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:29,452
<i>I remember I was so stoked about it being my birthday,</i>

290
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:30,735
<i>I spent all I had.</i>

291
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:36,334
<i>We made a ton of sandwiches, but since it
was just my mom and me, we had a lot left over.</i>

292
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:41,683
I'm home.

293
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,934
Ready and...

294
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,249
Kayo, Satoru!

295
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:51,601
Happy birthday, guys!

296
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:55,003
Wait. Mom, you knew about this?

297
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,338
I helped out a little,

298
00:17:56,363 --> 00:17:59,287
but they're the real masterminds behind this evil scheme.

299
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,706
So then, today, those chores were planned, too?

300
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,376
Uh‐huh. We asked Mr. Yashiro to stall you.

301
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:09,255
He also told us it was Kayo's birthday today.

302
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,009
I guess our little surprise worked, huh?

303
00:18:12,076 --> 00:18:13,280
Uh, yeah.

304
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:14,933
Guess what, Kayo.

305
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,152
Satoru insisted on getting a cake just for you.

306
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,564
I'm sorry, Satoru. I tried.

307
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,899
But I couldn't finish your present in time.

308
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,806
Seriously? You were making me something?

309
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:28,725
Mm‐hmm.

310
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,439
<i>That's why she wanted to get home early yesterday.</i>

311
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:36,760
Last night, I fell asleep before I could finish it.

312
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,167
That's OK.

313
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,048
You can give it to me later.

314
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:41,865
Hey, guys.

315
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:45,355
Let's make 5,000 yen worth of sandwiches!

316
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:47,082
What?

317
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,272
You spent all the money?

318
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,562
<i>We all had a blast making those sandwiches together.</i>

319
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:59,816
<i>But this time, there weren't any
left over at the end of the night.</i>

320
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,246
<i>Friends are the best, no doubt.</i>

321
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,002
<i>Everyone brought presents for Kayo and me.</i>

322
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:10,701
<i>Talk about a haul. And then...</i>

323
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,134
That's from me.

324
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,111
Thank you, Satoru.

325
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:24,457
Thank you, everyone.

326
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,853
You can leave the cleaning up to us.

327
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:29,897
Yeah. Walk Kayo home.

328
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,046
It's so cold!

329
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,234
You're an idiot.

330
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,465
G‐Good night.

331
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,767
Here. Thank you for today.

332
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:47,056
I'm glad I got to be friends with you and the others.

333
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,048
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

334
00:19:50,629 --> 00:19:51,580
Promise.

335
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,570
Mm‐hmm. Can't wait.

336
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:56,561
Good night.

337
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,838
Good night.

338
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:13,560
<i>I did it. I did it.</i>

339
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,158
<i>It worked!</i>

340
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:17,959
<i>I changed history.</i>

341
00:20:24,966 --> 00:20:27,301
<i>Everyone had left by the time I got home.</i>

342
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,440
<i>I was so exhausted from the past few days,</i>

343
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,290
<i>all that built‐up tension finally popped.</i>

344
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:38,329
<i>I collapsed on my futon and slept like a log.</i>

345
00:20:43,566 --> 00:20:45,393
<i>Son of a bitch, I'm late!</i>

346
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,847
I'm here, sir, sorry!

347
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,075
Just in time. I was about to mark you tardy.

348
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:53,933
<i>Made it.</i>

349
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:57,841
OK. Does anyone know if Kayo's coming today?

350
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:13,572
<i>Kayo didn't show up that day. Or the next one.</i>

351
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,714
<i>And that promise she made me...</i>

352
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,401
<i>she never got to keep it.</i>
