1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:05,144
Time for the next phase of your farm education.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,740
Your time in the rice paddy was instructive,

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:10,125
but I think you're ready for more.

4
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:13,748
Lesson number two is... going in dry!

5
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:16,365
There are tons of crops that grow in those conditions.

6
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,072
What're we gonna start her on?

7
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:19,174
Hmph.

8
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:20,711
The soybean.

9
00:00:20,804 --> 00:00:21,948
Outta sight!

10
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:26,117
I chose them, not only because as novice farmers go,

11
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:27,590
they're a pretty forgiving crop,

12
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:30,406
but because the end-product
is such a Jack of all trades.

13
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,298
Miso, soy sauce, tofu, natto, cooked beans,

14
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:35,961
soymilk and soy flour.

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,823
They can also be made into bean sprouts or edamame.

16
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:41,364
Edamame is soybean, then?

17
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:42,679
You betcha!

18
00:00:42,704 --> 00:00:43,865
The humble soybean.

19
00:00:43,948 --> 00:00:46,090
So packed with nutrients and carbohydrates.

20
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,349
some call it "the meat of the field".

21
00:00:48,823 --> 00:00:50,945
People eat it all the time, it's fairly common,

22
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,656
but that's just one use for this awesome legume.

23
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,651
In a bean-ocracy, they would be king!

24
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:08,736
When will it sprout up?

25
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,742
Soybeans grow pretty quickly.

26
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:11,922
Tonight, then?

27
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,259
Wow. You are so from the city.

28
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:17,505
Ten days' to two weeks' time, give or take.

29
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:22,698
All right!

30
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:24,279
Show them who's boss, Ringo!

31
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,515
As Ringo pushed those handy
little soybeans into the soil,

32
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,823
we had no idea that one of their products, miso,

33
00:01:29,848 --> 00:01:31,673
would soon be leading me down the shirtless path

34
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,054
of yogurty hell!

35
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,532
Aww! Guys, we're out of miso!

36
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,607
Who feels like going on a supply run?

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,186
But doesn't that mean going up to Biotech?

38
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:14,615
Yeah.

39
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,282
What's a Biotech?

40
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:18,615
Oh. It's another class, like us.

41
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,115
Its full name's the Biotechnology Department.

42
00:03:21,198 --> 00:03:23,965
We also call them Class B, which works out pretty well.

43
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:25,781
Miso is important, but...

44
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,513
Biotech...

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,430
I'm not a big fan of their class rep, to be honest.

46
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,240
Why's that?

47
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,990
He's totally weird.

48
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,246
He's so standoff-ish most of the time.

49
00:03:35,426 --> 00:03:37,548
And then he's staring at you all funny-like.

50
00:03:37,748 --> 00:03:38,883
Does he want to talk?

51
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,331
You look at him to engage him in conversation

52
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:43,031
but he runs away for safety.

53
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,585
Then stares some more.

54
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:45,468
Awkward...

55
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,192
Mm-hmm!

56
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,202
Fine then, don't talk to him. But if nobody mans
up, there won't be any miso soup at dinner.

57
00:03:51,285 --> 00:03:53,077
I want soup, but...

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,009
Kousaku. We can do this.

59
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,862
Yeah. Okay.

60
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:57,994
You ready?

61
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:58,744
Yeah.

62
00:03:58,986 --> 00:03:59,910
Miso!

63
00:03:59,994 --> 00:04:00,741
Hell yeah!

64
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,082
Little did we know...

65
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:07,799
Up here, right?

66
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:08,881
So they say.

67
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,119
You don't know, then?

68
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:14,244
Ringo?! What the heck?!

69
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:16,765
I just wanted to know where the room was.

70
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:17,787
Oh, right.

71
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:20,295
I forgot you've never been up to Class B before.

72
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,327
We're kind of in the same the boat...

73
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,244
We've never actually gone inside.

74
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,733
Look at this stuff. What do they do with it?

75
00:04:29,077 --> 00:04:31,872
Production's curriculum is very different than ours.

76
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,575
So they use all these machines?

77
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,430
It's like a lab in here!

78
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:39,327
Such is the power of science!

79
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:40,636
You...

80
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,706
You're Akari Suzuki, a.k.a. Bio Suzuki!

81
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:49,202
In the flesh. Minori said you
might be paying me a visit.

82
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,552
Here at Tamo No-Rin, the weirdest and strongest of us

83
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,341
are known as Farming's Top Four!

84
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:57,394
I never expected one of those
numbered students to be here!

85
00:04:57,719 --> 00:04:58,969
Now, now.

86
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,321
Protocol dictates that I receive the Class A rep,

87
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:04,329
his bosom friend, and the rather much-discussed

88
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:06,624
transfer student with open arms.

89
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:11,030
If you want some miso, take your fill, Class A!

90
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:12,882
Smells yummy.

91
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:14,386
As well it should.

92
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,574
Only soybeans that had gone through a thorough

93
00:05:16,599 --> 00:05:18,374
vetting process made it in.

94
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:19,796
Is that so?

95
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:21,784
Put some onto a cucumber.

96
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,595
It makes for a wonderful snack this time of year!

97
00:05:26,087 --> 00:05:26,725
Hurry it up.

98
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:27,754
Will do.

99
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:29,264
I guess you're hungry, huh?

100
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:30,597
Thanks for this beany boon.

101
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,319
Not just yet.

102
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:35,203
Before you go, would you be kind enough to help me

103
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:36,722
with a trifling matter?

104
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:37,735
"Trifling matter?"

105
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:38,833
What's up?

106
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:42,822
I require... some test subjects!

107
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,041
I don't want to!

108
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:46,994
Easy, boys...

109
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,430
We developed a new product in Class B.

110
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,755
I merely need some help with a trial run.

111
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:52,717
Really?

112
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,114
What exactly did you make?

113
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,065
A Lactobacillus!

114
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,132
Lactobacillus?

115
00:05:57,245 --> 00:05:58,994
Y'mean like that junk in yogurt?

116
00:05:59,077 --> 00:05:59,877
Very good.

117
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,281
It makes lactic acid, and this latest batch,

118
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:04,018
complements of the Biotech Department,

119
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,827
is of the vegetable variety.

120
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:06,798
Yeah, as if!

121
00:06:06,823 --> 00:06:07,928
Yogurt is made of milk.

122
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,125
I didn't just fall off of the turnip truck!

123
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:13,689
My poor boy, you must have metal in your head.

124
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:16,484
Lactobacilli are in rice bran pickles.

125
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,081
That miso you're holding.

126
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:20,680
You even find them floating in the air we breathe.

127
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,062
We call ours... !

128
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,201
Dun dun dun!

129
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,781
Anal BB! You like that?!

130
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:30,588
For "All Natural Life Science, Bio Type B".

131
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,603
It's the perfect acronym!

132
00:06:32,738 --> 00:06:34,058
Ho-boy.

133
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:35,744
With a name like that,

134
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:37,094
I thought it was some kind of ointment

135
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,339
Apply directly to the anus.

136
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,733
Geez! Did you really have to blurt it out?!

137
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:42,569
I'm going to regret asking,

138
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:45,595
but exactly what sort of trial run did you have in mind?

139
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:49,507
Just testing the product in real-world conditions.

140
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,613
Specifically, this yogurt made from Anal BB.

141
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,924
A taste-test, huh?

142
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,432
Why didn't you say so earlier?

143
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,413
While I applaud your willingness to lend me a hand.

144
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:00,927
This isn't the kind of yogurt you eat.

145
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:01,310
Huh?!

146
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,460
No. It's the kind...

147
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,912
...you apply topically!

148
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:06,831
It's topical yogurt?

149
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:07,915
It's not for eating?

150
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,846
It's a fact.

151
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:11,672
Lactobacillus on crops reduces vermin attacks.

152
00:07:11,702 --> 00:07:14,557
Not to mention the added
promotion of healthy germination.

153
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:16,226
This is common knowledge!

154
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,035
Even if the proof is anecdotal!

155
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,535
With that in mind, I thought Anal BB might help

156
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,053
other things grow, too!

157
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,802
Well, she did hook us up with the miso.

158
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:25,878
We're in her debt.

159
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,420
So what do you think? Want to give it a shot?

160
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:29,470
I'm game.

161
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,377
Bad call, self.

162
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,369
So, uh, where are our shirts?

163
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,288
What, and get Anal BB all over them?

164
00:07:38,313 --> 00:07:39,530
I think not!

165
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,823
It's time for yogurt bukkake!

166
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,274
No need to get involved, Kinoshita.

167
00:07:46,394 --> 00:07:48,154
Your face is plenty smooth without them

168
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,568
shooting all over it.

169
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,164
You down for Anal BB?

170
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,836
Yeah. Whatever you're packing, give me.

171
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:00,625
Ugh!

172
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:04,231
Fill me in. What's up with the camera?

173
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,694
Yeah, what's that about?

174
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,006
You troglodyte!

175
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,837
The answer to your question is patently obvious!

176
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,434
I owe it to science to document my results!

177
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:16,010
Now, less talkin' and more bukkak-in'!

178
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,637
Dude. Really?

179
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,387
Ah... !

180
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:21,548
Candid shots!

181
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,113
Skeet!

182
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,611
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet!

183
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,285
You fool! Why'd you aim for the chest?

184
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,226
Hit him in the glasses next time!

185
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:33,090
If you know what's good for you,

186
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,952
you'll shoot your wad on his lenses!

187
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:35,977
Fix his make-up!

188
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,717
Skeet!

189
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:40,705
Kei, this is a food experiment, isn't it?

190
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,635
Please tell me we're not in a yogurt porn.

191
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,366
Perhaps it's a little bit of both.

192
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:46,865
I'm ready for my close-up, Miss Suzuki!

193
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:49,711
Quiet on the set, men!

194
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,904
You, you, Splotch-a-Bro, scene two, action!

195
00:08:52,952 --> 00:08:54,439
Aw, come on!

196
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,970
Don't sacrifice my dignity for
a film with a ripped-off title!

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,522
She swiped Hakusho!

198
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,821
Now I will show you my power at 80 percent!

199
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,035
Dude, not the time to quote it!

200
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,449
Uwegh!

201
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:10,913
What the hell? You're shipping us!

202
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:13,358
His bro-gurt is your destiny!

203
00:09:13,383 --> 00:09:15,850
Hmm... That line. Put it in the fan-fic.

204
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:16,921
You idiot!

205
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,594
I don't want to be a Mary-Sue in my own slash!

206
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:21,640
What does all that even mean?!

207
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,329
Huh?!

208
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,523
Kei! Where're your pants?

209
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,252
Bro-gurt... Bro-gurt...

210
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:30,910
You-You don't want to do this!

211
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:32,190
No, please!

212
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,459
Glad you got it off!

213
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,192
These dailies are solid.

214
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,289
As a sign of thanks, I'll give you a "tip."

215
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:52,406
Say "hint", not "tip".

216
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,901
Even now as we speak, F is on the move.

217
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,048
So watch yourself.

218
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:00,180
Dear God! F?!

219
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:07,686
Go-go-go-go-go, got to go, got to go fast!

220
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:14,304
Kousaku!

221
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,612
What're you doing out here?

222
00:10:15,637 --> 00:10:17,809
No! Go back! It isn't safe out here!

223
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:20,226
But waiting got boring.

224
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:21,674
So you threw your lives away

225
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,285
because you got a little antsy?!

226
00:10:23,721 --> 00:10:25,661
What's got you all freaked out?

227
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:29,799
Legend tells of a class of great brutality.

228
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:33,645
Brute strength is the only law they choose to recognize!

229
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,850
Sowing terror among their foes for a century now,

230
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,891
these dervishes of doom formed
the backbone of our very school!

231
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,743
Their class is the letter...

232
00:10:41,882 --> 00:10:42,273
F!

233
00:10:44,284 --> 00:10:45,010
F, huh?

234
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,089
Yes! And the F stands for... !

235
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,667
fooling with the Woodmen is a fatal flaw,

236
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,880
friend-o!

237
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:54,994
Hey... I know you!

238
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,988
You're one of Farming's Top Four,

239
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:00,300
Class F rep Rintarou "Woodman" Miyoumoto!

240
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:01,939
Shut up, sapling!

241
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,927
I'm going to take you up to the House of Pain.

242
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,432
The Treehouse of Pain, that is.

243
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,157
How come, huh? What'd I do wrong?

244
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:17,244
Sure, play dumb.

245
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,052
You and I both know.

246
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:22,689
You talk to women so easy just to spite us!

247
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,865
The F in Class F is for "forest".

248
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:27,769
Of all the various departments,

249
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:30,798
Forest Engineering has the single harshest curriculum.

250
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:34,718
None of us graduate without first
surviving rigorous mortal combat.

251
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,146
We live up here six months outta twelve.

252
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,510
We're men! With wood in our hearts!

253
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,969
An' we're going to show you our wood!

254
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:45,262
This guy has no idea what he just said, does he?

255
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:47,744
Guys like you don't do anything
but mess around in the dirt

256
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,478
with seeds and junk, and you have two actual,

257
00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:52,763
real-live girls following you around?!

258
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:54,123
That's balls!

259
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,082
Didn't a girl join your class this year?

260
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:58,020
She left the next day!

261
00:11:58,045 --> 00:12:01,148
You Class A twerps bogart the knockout transfer student,

262
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,815
and that's bad enough, but watching you treat Nakazawa

263
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,565
like chopped liver hits us like a handsaw in the heart!

264
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,719
That's old-growth devotion, man!

265
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:10,636
Wait. Do you like her?

266
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:11,282
She's nice!

267
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:11,940
Cheerful!

268
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:12,523
Boobies!

269
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:13,148
Childhood friend!

270
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:13,985
Good cook!

271
00:12:14,815 --> 00:12:17,898
She's got everything we Woodmen look for in a woman!

272
00:12:17,961 --> 00:12:20,123
So why are you sprung for the new girl?!

273
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:20,916
Huh?

274
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,495
Yeah! I think the tree-dude's
making some good points there!

275
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,154
Listen up, Kousaku. And listen good.

276
00:12:28,362 --> 00:12:30,487
Cause I'm only going to say this once.

277
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:35,165
Is it true that you and Nakazawa
here used to take baths together

278
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,357
'til you were in the ninth grade?

279
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,679
Huh?!

280
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,707
No, of course not! That's crazy-talk, man!

281
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,768
Yeah, I should've known better!

282
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,329
No guy is that kind of lucky!

283
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:45,204
It was only up until the eighth grade!

284
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:47,016
You son-of-a-bitch!

285
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,961
Wait! It's not what you're thinking, okay?

286
00:12:50,165 --> 00:12:52,891
I haven't had a mom for years and years now,

287
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,924
and my dad works away from home in the winter.

288
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,255
Get to the bath part!

289
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,681
Dad sent me to live at Minori's house for a while.

290
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:00,223
Get to the bath part!

291
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,224
There were too many kids to bathe alone

292
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,582
so my baths were with all four sisters.

293
00:13:05,797 --> 00:13:08,998
You're telling me... You had four girls in the bath?!

294
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:09,790
At once?

295
00:13:09,815 --> 00:13:10,507
Yup.

296
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:13,413
All right. You're dead!

297
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:14,790
I don't want to die just 'cause I kept up

298
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,232
with my personal hygene!

299
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,190
You didn't miss out on anything, trust me!

300
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:20,815
There were no branches on this
trunk, if you catch my drift!

301
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:23,631
No branches, huh?! What the hell's wrong with you?

302
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,430
Well it was the truth, wasn't it?!

303
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:26,308
Maybe then!

304
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,788
But maybe you should check out
these redwoods I'm packing now!

305
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,198
If you want to keep the tree simile afloat

306
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:32,582
they're more like bonsais.

307
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,980
Ah! Why're you being such a bastard?!

308
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:35,981
You know what?!

309
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:38,034
My bonsais and I are dragging you into the bath

310
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,543
for a rematch later today! If I'm really such a zero,

311
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:42,645
it shouldn't be a problem for you, right?!

312
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:44,773
Yeah, fine. I guess.

313
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,340
Not that I care either way...

314
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,315
That a boy!

315
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:49,051
I'm going to give your back a good scrubbing

316
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:50,357
the way I always used to!

317
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,107
Nah, I'm good!

318
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,315
No you're not!

319
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,783
There're some places we just can't get to.

320
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,523
You could wash my back, too.

321
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,982
It's only fair, you big butthead.

322
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:02,009
After that, we could take a
crack at each other's fronts!

323
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,369
Cute!

324
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,334
Huh. Eighth grade.

325
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,463
That story, is it true?

326
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:18,727
You were just joking, right?

327
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,148
Riny!

328
00:14:21,232 --> 00:14:23,940
He looks tore up. What the heck?

329
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,805
It's because love-triangles are like poison to him!

330
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,259
Want to know something, Kousaku?

331
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,127
Yeah. I guess.

332
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:35,773
I.... I never got to sit next to a girl in class

333
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:38,357
not having girls or desks out here.

334
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,114
And I never will.

335
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,838
Not unless I take the bull by the horns, right?

336
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,093
Problems are like trees.

337
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,451
Unless I start chopping away at
them, they won't go down.

338
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,776
That's it, then. My mind's made up.

339
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:58,475
I'm going to give the Forest Engineering Department

340
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,107
such a spit-shine,
the ladies will be signing up in droves.

341
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,697
Yeah? How you figure?

342
00:15:04,357 --> 00:15:05,244
We'll court them.

343
00:15:05,415 --> 00:15:05,997
Court who?

344
00:15:06,065 --> 00:15:10,383
Forest Girls!

345
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,273
The F in Class F is for Forest!

346
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:16,982
Yes, I speak of that fashion trend

347
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,690
that's taking the ladies by storm!

348
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,690
We'll be their lumberjacks of love!

349
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:24,983
What? That idea came and went, you guys.

350
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,287
She's right. They've moved on.

351
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,355
You'll need a time machine.

352
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,701
Shut up!

353
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,667
Can't you see how badly we need women up in here?!

354
00:15:31,773 --> 00:15:34,290
If only we could sit next to one
and then forget our textbook,

355
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,388
so we'd have to share?

356
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,497
Or both of us go to pick up a dropped pencil at once

357
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:38,823
and our fingers touch?

358
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:43,315
And the group projects! Think of the group projects!

359
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:46,607
The F in Class F is for Female!

360
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,926
It's like they were raised on dating sims.

361
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:52,081
You know, they might actually find the right ones yet.

362
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:54,493
While it's true that the Forest Girl fad

363
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,190
didn't have quite so much in the way of staying power,

364
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:00,471
there's a new breed of athletic, outdoorsy women

365
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:02,333
who might just be what you guys are looking for.

366
00:16:03,513 --> 00:16:05,761
You mean it? Take a knee, fellas!

367
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:07,982
I'm talking about. Mountain Girls!

368
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,165
Mountain Girls!

369
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,190
They go hiking on rock-strewn trails.

370
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,207
And some of them even mountain-climb.

371
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:15,940
This growing trend could bring
them right to your doorstep!

372
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:19,023
The F in Class F is for Mt. Fuji!

373
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:22,146
Back to the summit! To await our womens!

374
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,773
I hope they're cool with a hell of a wait.

375
00:16:31,349 --> 00:16:33,065
It seems Rintarou has lost.

376
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,772
Of Farming's Top Four, he is the weakest.

377
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:40,258
He's a disgrace to our good name,

378
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:42,398
defeated by a mere lack of women.

379
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,357
It's time for a snack, my tender morsel.

380
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,234
Huh? Maybe she's just running late or something.

381
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:13,690
Hmm... She said she'd be here, though.

382
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:15,063
Wonder what's up?

383
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,023
Well, if she's not out here,

384
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:20,713
I don't know where to look.

385
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:24,644
No! Her book!

386
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:30,707
You're seventeen? Serendipitous.

387
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:34,298
As years go, that one is molto bellissimo.

388
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:36,332
Aren't you the same age?

389
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,063
I am seventeen at every age.

390
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,558
Numbers of its ilk are known as prime.

391
00:17:41,998 --> 00:17:44,231
They're lonely in their indivisibility.

392
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,546
A loneliness I know only too well.

393
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,907
That's enough!

394
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,488
I knew that it was you, Class E rep, Rose Hanazono!

395
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:53,796
Why, yes, I am!

396
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,457
I've got your number!

397
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:59,371
You're a student in the Landscaping Department,

398
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,207
and you're one of Farming's Top Four,

399
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,107
not to mention the fact you're
the hottest guy in school!

400
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,079
None of that gives you the right to kidnap Ringo!

401
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,506
For that, your life is forfeit!

402
00:18:11,851 --> 00:18:12,955
Hey, Kousaku.

403
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,409
Please tell me your virtue is still intact!

404
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:20,065
Why'd you no-show at the library, huh?

405
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:21,797
He offered me snacks, so...

406
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,518
How the heck have you even survived this long?!

407
00:18:24,591 --> 00:18:27,055
And you! Did I or did I not tell you to never ever

408
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,975
mess around with Class A girls again?!

409
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,561
Oh yeah? So what did he do before?

410
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:34,776
He tried putting the moves on Minori about a year ago.

411
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,959
You still recall that?

412
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:39,315
Her too, I'll wager.

413
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:40,940
Know what happens when a hot guy

414
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,565
hits on a girl like Minori?!

415
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:44,440
She loses her damn mind, that's what!

416
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,508
You're all she wanted to talk
about for the next three weeks!

417
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:52,561
I get what I want, my dear boy, no matter the cost.

418
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,538
It's a good policy to have...

419
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:55,491
Eh?

420
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,998
You don't get to add her to the list 'cause she's...

421
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,308
not for sale!

422
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:08,345
That's just lip-service.

423
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,440
Like hell!

424
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,497
The Pockin knows your measure.

425
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:13,750
Face me in crunchy combat!

426
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:16,165
Where did you... get that?

427
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,534
The rules are few.
We start chewing at it from either side.

428
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,885
Whoever breaks it apart or flinches first is the loser.

429
00:19:23,243 --> 00:19:25,090
Have at you, churl!

430
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,530
Trial by Pockin! With Ringo as prize to the victor!

431
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:29,570
Bring it on!

432
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,870
Don't fret, Ringo! I've got this one in the bag!

433
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,612
He's really going on the offensive, huh?!

434
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,018
What?!

435
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,500
Hanazono closed his eyes! He's not backing off at all!

436
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,805
He just keeps nibbling!

437
00:19:59,358 --> 00:20:00,911
My heart is pounding!

438
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,501
The heat from his face is burning me up!

439
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:08,065
Stop this game! It's a trap!

440
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:11,252
And not a single moment to spare.

441
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,718
Kousaku, I need you to step away
from that man on the double!

442
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,832
Rose Hanazono is class rep of
the Landscaping Department,

443
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:20,925
but the landscape that interests
him most is right in front of him!

444
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,482
I was too late!

445
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:37,153
Get your mouth off of him!

446
00:20:37,232 --> 00:20:39,035
That right there is the money shot!

447
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,268
I have tasted the rainbow!

448
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,767
Your first kiss wasn't Ringo! It was me, 'Zono!

449
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,864
You have a lot of nerve, don't you!

450
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:56,877
Indeed.

451
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,018
How long I've waited for this moment.

452
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,064
It was di molto bellissima!

453
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:06,565
Then... you couldn't care less about Minori or Ringo!

454
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:07,631
Go on!

455
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:10,192
You used them to get to me 'cause you're... !

456
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:11,530
Yes! I am!

457
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,704
Well I am not, so slow your roll, hot-lips!

458
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:17,732
And you guys just sat back and let this happen?

459
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:18,946
You betcha!

460
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:21,930
Your uke hi-jinks will play out
fantastically in my doujinshi!

461
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,732
How come I got to be the uke?!

462
00:21:23,757 --> 00:21:25,827
There's a big gay world waiting for you!

463
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:26,607
I'm fine right here!

464
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:28,540
It's all because he bathed with me!

465
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,315
Your boobs are great, okay?!

466
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,099
Hey.

467
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,045
You need something, Ringo?

468
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,065
One, Bio Suzuki.

469
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,378
Two, Woodman Rintarou.

470
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,823
Three, Rose Hanazono.

471
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:44,630
Mm... So?

472
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:46,645
Aren't there four?

473
00:21:57,803 --> 00:21:58,963
Next time on No-Rin,

474
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:01,482
the last member of Farming's Top Four will arrive!

475
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,333
Probably could've done all this
in one episode, but whatever!

476
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:39,292
Full-Moe Alchemist: Bounty.
