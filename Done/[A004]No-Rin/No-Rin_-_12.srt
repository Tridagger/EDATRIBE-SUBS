1
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,040
Thing is, I want to be there for you.

2
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:36,228
Any village that raised you must be wonderful.

3
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,025
Thank you for coming ladies and germs!

4
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:50,380
How y'all doing this lovely country morn'?

5
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:52,630
Finer than frog hair!

6
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:55,285
Alrighty! Now the moment you've all been waiting for!

7
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,005
Let's get the first annual Aioi
village mixer up and running!

8
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,637
What do you say, folks?!

9
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,545
Who's ready to mingle and slam
headfirst into your soul mate?

10
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,725
Here you go, ma'am.

11
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,237
We got a live one.

12
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,317
I need you to get in there and run interference for me.

13
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,630
Huh? What's up?

14
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:28,672
Be discreet. There's a cougar at your
8 o'clock liable to chase off the men.

15
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:30,774
Let her sink her claws into you for a bit.

16
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,172
Eh? Okay, we must be talking about a real piece

17
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,726
of work if she makes you uncomfortable. Wow.

18
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:38,535
Deal is, no one's gonna buy the age she put down.

19
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:40,590
Granted we all fudge the numbers a tad

20
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,889
when we're looking to bag a mate, but this is absurd.

21
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:46,115
She's just... Well, see for yourself.

22
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,906
I mean... Damn...

23
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:52,488
Where is she?

24
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:58,235
Holy crap! You've gotta be kidding me! Miss Becky?

25
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,610
What are you even doing here?!

26
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:01,158
And why do you look like Ramses' the Great?!

27
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:01,804
Forget it, General, I can't!

28
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,071
You know this bag of bones?

29
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,313
She's my teacher.

30
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,312
Good, so there's no ice to break.

31
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,967
Go get her, chief! You're my hero!

32
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:19,297
Miss Becky, is that you?

33
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,963
Almost didn't recognize you, you look so...
eh, slender...

34
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:29,835
I'm on a new anti-aging regimen.

35
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,896
Strict fasting. That's the secret.

36
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,906
Revitalizes the cells.

37
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:41,047
Huh. That's nice. Wow. Fasting.

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,463
I bet is shaves years off... Not
that you have that many years

39
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:47,005
on your back to shave off in the first place, of course!

40
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,272
But you know what'll work even better?!

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,963
Goin' organic!

42
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,120
Mega refreshed!

43
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,395
Poo! And here I've been trying
so hard to stay disciplined!

44
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,963
You're a terrible influence!

45
00:03:12,482 --> 00:03:14,463
Please stop looking at me like that.

46
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:17,547
Sorry, my love! Old habits die hard.

47
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,322
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Is this seat taken?

48
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:24,981
No. Please. Be my guest.

49
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,073
Oh my, aren't we a perfect gentleman?

50
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:30,307
A-buh-bayummm!

51
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,463
So anyway, so they were all up in arms

52
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:39,213
about the skirt being too short.

53
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:41,734
See, I'm in a better place about my legs now.

54
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,296
Skinny jeans. That's the goal.

55
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,980
I've gotta do something!

56
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:47,962
Miss Becky's being swallowed by the generation gap!

57
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:49,870
Hey, there! Hungry?

58
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:52,281
Made fresh by the Aioi Wives Association!

59
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,112
Oh, how cute! That smell really takes me back.

60
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:57,285
Kind of reminds me of cafeteria food.

61
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:59,147
I know, right? Like whale fritters!

62
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,630
Fritters? Do what?

63
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,927
Just where did you go to school
that they served you whale?

64
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,630
My grandparents used to eat that kind of stuff.

65
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,303
Miss Becky, no!

66
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:08,422
It's too late.

67
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:10,630
I've held back as long as I could stand.

68
00:04:10,822 --> 00:04:12,342
I must unleash!

69
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:16,621
Crap! Not that! Anything but that!

70
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,380
Forty-ish... Dimension!

71
00:04:21,246 --> 00:04:22,801
Believe it or not, home skillets:

72
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:25,873
Life before the dot com bust
was all that and a bag of chips!

73
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:29,255
Uh... O-kay. Is it just me, or did it get seriously 90s

74
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:30,713
up in here?

75
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:32,200
What you want, what you really, really want!

76
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,455
Wow, that's neat.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,605
Uh... I'm going to go get us all some refills.

78
00:04:37,925 --> 00:04:39,856
No you don't, Skinny Jeans!

79
00:04:44,087 --> 00:04:47,547
Well, that was... a thing.

80
00:04:47,744 --> 00:04:49,255
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

81
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,438
So, what brings a lady like you

82
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,243
to a country mixer like this?

83
00:04:57,517 --> 00:04:59,397
I mean, farming's so yesterday, right?

84
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:01,733
Oh, no! Farming's awesome! Really!

85
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,897
Hunky men, working with their hands...

86
00:05:04,106 --> 00:05:05,829
Girls love that whole thing right now.

87
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:07,636
I guarantee you every woman here's in the market

88
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:08,622
for a farm boy.

89
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:10,594
But what's the appeal?!

90
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,630
It's not like there's any money working the soil.

91
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,422
Just back-breaking labor sunup to sundown.

92
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,963
Oh, come on. It's exotic.

93
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,896
At least it is when you're from the big city.

94
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,842
Really? But... I mean...

95
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:25,172
I'd think the big city would be more exotic

96
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,917
than a pile of dirt like this.

97
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:29,167
Right...? This is nowheres-ville.

98
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:30,422
Are you kidding?!

99
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,355
You have no idea what it's like in the city!

100
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,805
There's traffic congestion, office politics,

101
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:36,005
sexual harassment suits,

102
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,791
dog-eat-dog corporate takeovers...

103
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:40,228
A real farm beats a cube-farm any day!

104
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,768
At least here you're not just a cog in the machine!

105
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,214
Huh...

106
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,048
Sorry.

107
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,368
But you see my point, don't you?

108
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,939
Friends of yours?

109
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:57,966
I'm his queen.

110
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,042
And I'm his knocked-up wife.

111
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:05,058
How's it going, folks?

112
00:06:05,118 --> 00:06:07,611
We good? Y'all enjoying yourselves or what?

113
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,669
How about a little game to loosen things up?

114
00:06:11,694 --> 00:06:13,755
Maybe spice this party up a notch!

115
00:06:14,027 --> 00:06:16,588
It's time to give our "First Impressions!"

116
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:17,957
Here's how it goes:

117
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,153
I'll unveil a word from the easel and ask,

118
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,587
"Who's the most-whatever the
word happens to be," okey-doke?

119
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:24,180
Then, you point to the person in your group

120
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:25,547
you think that applies to!

121
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,213
Ugh.

122
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:27,833
Oh! This'll be fun!

123
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,064
I'm liking this.

124
00:06:29,444 --> 00:06:31,970
Alright, round one: go!

125
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:33,782
Let's see now...

126
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,490
Who's the cutest?

127
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,672
Yeah, you got it.

128
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,178
Come on, silly. Which of us you going to point to?

129
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:44,971
Yeah, yeah. You gotta pick one.

130
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,172
Uh... Well...

131
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,511
I think it's pretty obvious who I'm going to go...

132
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:53,348
Oh, that's so adorable. My honey-baby's... SHY!!

133
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,327
Yeouch!

134
00:06:54,352 --> 00:06:56,834
Sounds like things are really
starting to heat up out there, huh?

135
00:06:56,977 --> 00:06:58,547
Moving on up to round two.

136
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,363
Who at your table is the kindest?

137
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:07,563
Sweet pea, you must be exhausted.

138
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:09,624
Why don't you let me give you a massage?

139
00:07:09,649 --> 00:07:13,368
Uh-oh. Somebody looks thirsty. Baby wanna drink?

140
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:17,415
Uh... Sure, why not? Thank you?

141
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,143
Hi-yaah!

142
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:18,737
Not the face!!

143
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:20,824
Here! Bottoms up, darling!

144
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:24,683
Tee-hee.

145
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:30,922
So... Who is it?

146
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:33,870
Forfeit!

147
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:34,938
Next up!

148
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:38,422
Who in your group is the chubbiest?

149
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:42,956
Oh now, now. Be nice.

150
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,563
Didn't your mother teach you not to lie?

151
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:45,849
Don't get defensive.

152
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,963
So you've packed on a few pounds since coming here.

153
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,476
There's no shame in that.

154
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,765
Ho-ho, things are really popping now!

155
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,907
Shoulders back! Who's the flattest?

156
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:07,289
Me! Me! You could roll dough on this chest!

157
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:08,547
Huh? Huh?!

158
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,880
Okay, folks! We're about to get real up in here!

159
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:14,755
Bring your A-game, it's the final round!

160
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:15,786
Who's...

161
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:18,172
Don't keep us in suspense!

162
00:08:18,255 --> 00:08:19,807
Who's the person you most want to marry

163
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,720
and spend the rest of your life with?!

164
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:24,310
Kousaku!

165
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,130
Koutan!

166
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,634
Pick one!

167
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,117
Geez, nothing like putting me on the spot, huh?

168
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,763
I choose...

169
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,953
To run the hell away!

170
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,151
Hmph. Someone's got cold feet.

171
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,938
Nice try, slick.

172
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,630
Son of a...  Why do you have me all dolled up

173
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,963
in this monkey suit?!

174
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:08,005
Heh. You referring to the tux or the ropes?

175
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,213
Enough of this, huh?

176
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,185
Shouldn't I technically be in a hakama anyway?

177
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,829
We had you in one of those for the engagement ceremony.

178
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:20,977
For the wedding we want more

179
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:22,505
of an East meets West kind of thing.

180
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,121
Are you out of your mind?!

181
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:25,681
You want to kick off my married life

182
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,588
by pissing off the local gods?!

183
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,769
I'm begging you here, Kousaku.

184
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:39,089
Please.

185
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,875
Ugh. Can I at least ask you a question first?

186
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:54,764
Why'd you come back here? You hated this town.

187
00:09:55,157 --> 00:09:57,880
You'd been chomping at the bit
to leave since I've known you.

188
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:03,487
World's too small.

189
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,516
Huh?

190
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,688
No matter how far you go, you always end up

191
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:11,172
back where you started, or someplace just like it.

192
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,822
Wherever you run to,

193
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,762
there's always something holding you down.

194
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,182
Always someone pissed at you.

195
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:20,182
She abandoned ship once.

196
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:22,255
Stands to reason she'll do it again.

197
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,754
Hell, you run long enough...

198
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,820
...pretty soon you find out
you're just running in place.

199
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,116
Deal is...

200
00:10:37,672 --> 00:10:39,630
...sometimes the only way get where you're going

201
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,599
is to face where you're from.

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,566
Think about it.

203
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,437
You a runner?

204
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:48,874
I don't know.

205
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,728
Attention everyone. Attention please.

206
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:34,975
The Nakazawa-Hata wedding ceremony beings now.

207
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:54,313
Before we bid welcome to the bride and groom,

208
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:57,613
Allow me to introduce their friends Ringo Kinoshita

209
00:12:57,658 --> 00:13:00,459
and Becky Natsumi, our stunning bridesmaids.

210
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,532
Ah, and the bride's darling little sisters,

211
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:06,309
Takumi and Akina, who are thrilled to be

212
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:07,653
our flower girls.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,838
Erectile dysfunction, emotional unavailability.

214
00:13:15,902 --> 00:13:18,130
Wandering eyes. Passive aggression.

215
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,213
Breakdown of communication. Backbiting in-laws.

216
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,838
Welcome to matrimony!

217
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:42,605
Now, if you'd join me, let's, uh...

218
00:13:42,793 --> 00:13:45,428
Let's give a warm round of applause to our groom!

219
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:55,884
Next, the gorgeous, young bride-to-be.

220
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,297
Escorted by one very proud papa!

221
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:06,207
Oh, wow! She looks beautiful!

222
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,672
They met, I presume, like many of you here.

223
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:17,886
As children.

224
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,963
Kousaku moved to Aioi with his parents,

225
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,626
who came to our humble little village with big dreams

226
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:23,737
and a lot of heart.

227
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,547
Sadly, before the family could realize its ambitions

228
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:27,713
of living off the land,

229
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:30,088
Kousaku's beloved mother passed away.

230
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,380
Minori was a beacon and pillar of strength

231
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,463
for the bereft young boy.

232
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:34,614
She's right.

233
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,375
Minori was always there for me when things got rough.

234
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,463
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would...

235
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,297
We ask, with a prayer in our hearts,

236
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,854
that you give your blessing.

237
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,172
That you recognize and let be fulfilled the love

238
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,338
these two earnest souls have for each other;

239
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,800
a love that has triumphed over
grief and made them strong.

240
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:58,698
Please, Son, take care of my precious little girl.

241
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,873
Treat her like the best friend she is.

242
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:04,232
Hang on.

243
00:15:04,257 --> 00:15:06,797
Does this mean we're not going
to be best friends anymore?

244
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,544
What?

245
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,439
I want to be your best friend.
You can't have more than one!

246
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,272
Oh, sweetie, don't worry.

247
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:13,963
Nothing's really gonna change.

248
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,130
He's still going to love you like he always has.

249
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,797
It's just that... Well, when two people marry,

250
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,172
they've gotta be best friends.
That's how it works, okay?

251
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,213
But we're still buddies with you.

252
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,088
No!

253
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,330
Taku?

254
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:28,602
I'm his best friend! You don't have to get married!

255
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,047
Uh... Yeah, we kinda do. I'm having his baby.

256
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,040
No you're not! You're just saying that!

257
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:35,545
Huh?

258
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:38,830
I know the difference between a baby and a kangaroo!

259
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,054
What on earth?

260
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,130
Surely it's too small to be a kangaroo?

261
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,660
Exactly what are you people trying to pull?!

262
00:15:52,713 --> 00:15:54,875
Okay, everyone, please settle down!

263
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,456
We're trying to have a wedding here.

264
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,800
I don't think you're trying to have a wedding at all!

265
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,132
What is the meaning of this?!

266
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:01,932
What have you tricked us all into?!

267
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:03,074
This whole thing's a lie!

268
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:05,588
But that speech! It... It was so heartfelt!

269
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:06,720
Outrageous!

270
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,154
No, wait... We, uh...

271
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,561
I demand an explanation immediately!

272
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:12,713
Do these kids even know each other?!

273
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,973
Met when they were children my foot!

274
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:17,146
They... !

275
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:17,736
Wait.

276
00:16:40,116 --> 00:16:42,022
Forgive me!

277
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:47,237
I'm sorry! If you're looking
for someone to blame, it's me.

278
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,630
From beginning to end,

279
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:51,127
this whole stupid fiasco has been my fault!

280
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,681
I never... It was never meant to go this far!

281
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,922
What started as a dumb joke went off the rails

282
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,429
and just spun completely out of control!

283
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:04,272
I... I was scared. My back was against the wall.

284
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,308
My only option was to see it through to the end.

285
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,785
Hooligan! So you string us along?!

286
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,588
Oh, well done! Bang up job representing your town!

287
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,722
I... I'm sorry!

288
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm sorry. Truth is...

289
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,412
I hated this town!

290
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,639
I got dragged here. No one gave me a say.

291
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,966
I was a kid; my parents were intent on becoming farmers

292
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:39,240
and I was going to be a part of
it whether I liked it or not.

293
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,954
I watched as their dreams crumbled.

294
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:46,170
As "good, clean living" chewed 'em up and spat 'em out.

295
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,350
We weren't even a family anymore when it was all over.

296
00:17:50,322 --> 00:17:51,642
I was left behind.

297
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,730
Only thing for me to do was take up farming.

298
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,407
It's hard work.

299
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:01,775
Especially when you don't wanna do it.

300
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:05,407
All I ever thought about was the
day when I could finally leave.

301
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,301
But through it all,
there was one person who gave me hope.

302
00:18:13,034 --> 00:18:13,838
A pop singer.

303
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:14,513
Ah!

304
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:18,654
Her songs, her TV shows... all of it... was magical.

305
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,005
The big city life she always sang about

306
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,748
seemed so far away, so perfect.

307
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:25,630
I wanted to be a part of it.

308
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,567
Thinking about her got me through the worst of times.

309
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,087
She buoyed me up.

310
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:34,192
Yeah, that's right. I hated living in this town.

311
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,642
It's tiny, impoverished, in the middle of nowhere.

312
00:18:40,743 --> 00:18:42,813
But then... she came here.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,922
She saw, and for some crazy reason,

314
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,737
she loved everything about it.

315
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:52,713
She opened my eyes to the beauty of Aioi,

316
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,712
and suddenly, the things I spent half my life

317
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,925
waiting to get away from felt as magical as her voice.

318
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,085
"Give me this view and the clean air any day.

319
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,985
Any village that raised you must be wonderful."

320
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:10,010
That's what she said to me, and for the first time...

321
00:19:10,737 --> 00:19:11,943
I understood.

322
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,618
Country life shaped me into who I am.

323
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:17,325
Look around you.

324
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,389
Warts and all, this little backwater town

325
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:21,350
inspired me to put myself on the line

326
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,128
to try and convince you to love it.

327
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:25,755
Look, You seem like nice people

328
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:27,638
and I'm not proud that I fooled you.

329
00:19:27,978 --> 00:19:30,130
But the point I'm trying to make is:

330
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:34,755
I've learned there's actually a lot to love

331
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,595
about this little place.

332
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:39,243
That's all I wanted to say.

333
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,463
Kousaku?

334
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:05,708
Ringo.

335
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:06,797
Hey.

336
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:07,880
Minori?

337
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:09,438
So, I guess...

338
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:12,797
You really prefer Ringo over me after
all, now don't you?

339
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:16,172
She was the one who made life bearable, not me.

340
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,719
It's not like that. This isn't about choosing one.

341
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,630
It's about finding the middle ground.

342
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,614
You see?

343
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,313
We don't need to shun the city
for the country, or vice versa.

344
00:20:27,338 --> 00:20:28,922
We just need to connect them.

345
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:31,838
The country feeds the city and
reminds people of their roots.

346
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:34,653
The city gives people something to aspire to.

347
00:20:34,907 --> 00:20:38,355
A bird needs two wings to fly,
we need each other to survive.

348
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,387
Why feel we have to favor one over the other

349
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,295
when the whole point is to have both?

350
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,772
When you stop and think about it,

351
00:20:43,797 --> 00:20:46,354
all of human history has been building to this!

352
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,606
See? We need one another!

353
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:51,934
You, Minori. And you, Ringo.

354
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,547
It's like I'm the bird.

355
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,138
And you two are my wings!

356
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:22,203
Saying a lot happened this
summer is an understatement.

357
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:26,108
But there's one important thing
all the craziness has taught me...

358
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:27,501
Yep.

359
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,868
If I've learned anything over the past few months,

360
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:32,018
it's that we all still have a lot to learn.

361
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,364
Mad cow! Mad cow!

362
00:22:42,648 --> 00:22:43,948
Ageha!

363
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:08,489
Kousaku?

364
00:23:08,836 --> 00:23:09,616
Hey.

365
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:11,853
Huh? What's up?

366
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,023
Go get him!

367
00:23:21,536 --> 00:23:24,442
Not again! We've been through this already!

368
00:23:25,433 --> 00:23:26,755
Some life, huh?

369
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,476
This has been Kousaku Hata,
and if you liked this, oh-ho!

370
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,347
Just you wait!
