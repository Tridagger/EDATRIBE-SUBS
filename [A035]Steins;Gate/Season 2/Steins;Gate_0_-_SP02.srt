1
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,875
[MAHO]
For cryin' out loud.

2
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,583
You know, after that
New Year's Thief fiasco,

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,166
I had hoped things would
settle down, but nope.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,000
--[door opens]
--Hm?

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,500
[laughs] Freeze, Maho!
This is a stickup!

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,583
What the heck did
you buy this time?

7
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:33,041
Isn't it wonderful?

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,916
I saw it in an Akihabara toy
store and couldn't resist.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,791
It's an air gun.

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,458
I got it for the festival.

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,125
It's great! Shoots
beans in rapid fire!

12
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:44,125
So let's cast out the demons
and rake in the bucks!

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,625
Isn't that how it goes?

14
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:48,000
It's "bring in the
luck," Professor.

15
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:49,916
Besides, shouldn't
we be getting ready

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,583
for the trip back to America?

17
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:54,000
Stop buying junk, or we're
gonna run out of room.

18
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,000
And Reyes won't like you
leaving clutter here.

19
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:58,458
You're right, we did
borrow this office space.

20
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,583
We should be good guests

21
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:01,208
and leave it cleaner
than we found it.

22
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,041
But still, there'll be
plenty of time later

23
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,833
for packing up and cleaning.

24
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,375
For now, let's have fun.

25
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:08,875
It'd behoove us to check out
the festivals before we go home

26
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,375
and let loose in the
Japanese tradition!

27
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,291
Haven't you heard
the old saying, Maho?

28
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:14,958
When the cat's away,
the mice will play,

29
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,208
and I know the perfect time.

30
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,791
Setsubun! [laughs]

31
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,166
Setsubun, huh?

32
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,875
I can't believe it's
already that time of year.

33
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,958
Huh?

34
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,291
Almost Valentine's Day!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,333
[SUZUHA]
See ya later, Boss.

36
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,583
Have a good night.

37
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,291
Guess we'll see you
in the morning.

38
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,750
[BRAUN]
Oh, hold on a sec.

39
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,333
[SUZUHA, KAGARI]
Hm?

40
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,250
[BRAUN] Here are your
wages for last month.

41
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,458
But... you're helping me out.

42
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,291
You protect me, so I work here.

43
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,291
I thought...

44
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,708
I pay my workers.

45
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:19,125
I have morals, you know.

46
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,041
[KAGARI]
But, sir.

47
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,208
[SUZUHA]
Come on, just take it.

48
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,416
Uh--

49
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,541
It's probably not very
much dough, anyway.

50
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,375
[BRAUN]
Oh, yeah?

51
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:26,916
[SUZUHA chuckles]

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sounds to me like somebody would
prefer to work for nothing!

53
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,791
Whoopsie, too slow!
Thanks for everything, Boss!

54
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,750
Why, you little...

55
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,708
Here you go.

56
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,750
[KAGARI]
Huh?

57
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:42,541
I really appreciate this!

58
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,291
[KAGARI giggles]

59
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,625
You sure seem happier
than usual today.

60
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:48,791
'Cause I am.

61
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,750
I've never been paid
for my work before.

62
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,875
Well, do you have any idea
how you're going to spend it?

63
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,916
[KAGARI] Hmm. That's
a really good question.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,583
I'll have to give
it some thought.

65
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,000
[SUZUHA gasps]

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,000
Wanna go? This place has
the most delicious desserts.

67
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,291
[SUZUHA] Uh, no, that okay.
I was just curious, is all.

68
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,625
[SUZUHA]
What's up, Kagari?

69
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,875
Well, uh...

70
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,875
This poster...
What's it talking about?

71
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,000
[KAGARI]
Valentine's Day?

72
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,833
Yeah. It's a special day where
people show their affection.

73
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,125
Usually by giving the ones that
they love thoughtful gifts,

74
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,125
like chocolate.

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,541
Oh, I see. How nice.

76
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,416
[SUZUHA]
Back when I was a little girl,

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,541
my mom would search high
and low for the ingredients

78
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,958
to make us chocolates
for Valentine's Day.

79
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,791
[KAGARI]
How wonderful!

80
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,541
[gasps]

81
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,458
Showing your feelings
with candy?

82
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,541
That's such a remarkable custom!

83
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,458
I've decided I want to
participate in the tradition!

84
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,416
What? You do?

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,666
[RUKA] Hey, uh, do you
think that Kagari...

86
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,958
...might have a special
someone in mind here?

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,125
Huh?

88
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,875
[AMADEUS]
So?

89
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,291
You've got something
planned for him, right?

90
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,541
Are you ever gonna
give this thing up?

91
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,416
I've told you repeatedly,
not happening.

92
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,458
Do not crush my dreams!

93
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,666
You're going back
to America soon.

94
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,333
You have to tell him how you
feel before it's time to leave.

95
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,541
Will you stop?

96
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,625
For the hundredth time,
it's not like that!

97
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:19,916
If you convince yourself that's
the truth, you'll regret it.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,041
I just think it's
better to take a chance

99
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:25,166
and make someone feel special,
even if it's "not like that."

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,208
Huh?

101
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,666
Maho?

102
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,333
[AMADEUS, MAKISE]
You there?

103
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,791
Ma'am?

104
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,875
[MAHO gasps]

105
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,750
Do you really not like anyone?

106
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,833
Yes, I told you that, now
will you give it a rest?

107
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,083
[MAKISE grunts]

108
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,625
[sighs] Besides, this
is America, you know?

109
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:48,958
From what I've seen,
the guys here

110
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,833
typically do the gift
giving, not the girls.

111
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,083
[MAKISE] Yeah, but don't you
think it coming from a girl

112
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,041
makes the gesture
even more romantic?

113
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,291
Bucking tradition to
reveal your feelings!

114
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,166
[MAHO] We're scientists.
Romance is not our forte.

115
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,375
"To be a scientist is
to be hopelessly romantic

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,416
in the truest sense."

117
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,250
Haven't you ever
heard that saying?

118
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,208
No, who said it? Einstein?

119
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,708
Yours truly.

120
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,291
[MAHO chuckles] Okay then,
Shakespeare, who do you like?

121
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,291
You're a beautiful
genius whose theories

122
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,791
are sure to be published
before you're 20.

123
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,833
There's a horde of men who'd
kill to be your Valentine.

124
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,791
[BOTH chuckle]

125
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,458
Since I've been in college,

126
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,750
several guys have approached
me with romantic intentions.

127
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,041
But as soon as we start talking,

128
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,041
they run away like I'm
some alien life form.

129
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,875
[MAKISE] Why can't they
handle losing a simple,

130
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:39,250
friendly debate? It's pathetic.

131
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,791
And besides.

132
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,333
I already have a special someone
in mind for Valentine's Day.

133
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,166
Wha--?

134
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,458
--[MAKISE gasps]
--Oh, no!

135
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,125
[MAKISE]
Anyway, I just think it's better

136
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,333
to take a chance and
make someone feel special,

137
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,958
even if it's not like that.

138
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,291
[MAHO]
Jeez.

139
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,166
What's wrong with you?
You're spacing out.

140
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,083
[MAHO]
Oh, sorry, it's nothing.

141
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,291
Regardless, this conversation
is officially over.

142
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:04,375
Are you serious?

143
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,708
[MAHO]
Don't give me that.

144
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,208
I'm shutting down now.

145
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,166
[FARIS] I overheard what you
were talking about in there.

146
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,708
Nya ha, ha, ha.

147
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,291
To think that Maho has a super
special someone in her life.

148
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,958
Excuse me?

149
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,000
[FARIS] Now you can pour
all those tender feelings

150
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,666
into your chocolate.

151
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,000
Reach out to your beloved!

152
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,583
Hang on! You're
completely delusional!

153
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,583
I never said anything
about a "beloved"!

154
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,708
[FARIS]
Oh, but you forget

155
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,708
I possess the eye of
the sky-god Horus.

156
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,708
I see what's written
on your heart.

157
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:35,041
Why doesn't anyone
ever believe me?

158
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,416
[MOEKA]
Chocolate.

159
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,833
--Huh?
--Uh?

160
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,291
--Meow, meow, meow!
--[MAHO gasps]

161
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,875
[yawns] Good morning.

162
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,208
Whoa, Kiryu?

163
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,875
How long have you been
hiding underneath there?

164
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,041
This whole time.

165
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,875
So that means you
heard everything.

166
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,458
I'm giving chocolate.

167
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,625
[ALL]
Huh?

168
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,833
I have someone to
give chocolate to.

169
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,541
[ALL gasp]

170
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,291
[AMADEUS] Does this mean
what I think it means?

171
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,916
[FARIS]
I'm so proud of Moe-meow!

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,166
Are you really going to
reveal your feelings to them?

173
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,041
Well, this is quite a surprise.

174
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,666
Yeah. I can't imagine you
confessing anything,

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
let alone love.

176
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,875
[AMADEUS]
So who is it, then?

177
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,125
[MOEKA]
Secret.

178
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,416
[MAHO]
What?

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
Delicious.

180
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,333
[KAGARI] So, uh... It goes
together like this, then?

181
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,750
No, no. You've got
it turned around.

182
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,541
But how? What have I done?

183
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,083
[SUZUHA]
Kagari has someone she likes.

184
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,333
[BRAUN]
Hello, ladies!

185
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,000
[NAE] Oh! Hi, Dad,
I'm glad you're back!

186
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,708
Well, Nae, have you
been a good girl?

187
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,125
[NAE] Yup! Miss Kagari and I
have been doing fun crafts!

188
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,083
Oh, you were?

189
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,500
Did you have a nice time?

190
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:51,375
Hey, Dad, guess what?
You know what Miss Kagari did?

191
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,750
No! Quiet!

192
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,875
She is the clumsiest
person I have ever met!

193
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,125
Nae! Why would you tell
him mean things about me?

194
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,208
[NAE]
Because!

195
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,500
Nothing to be
embarrassed about.

196
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,500
It's not like I
didn't already know.

197
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,333
Hey, c'mon, not you, too!

198
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:10,250
[NAE, BRAUN laughing]

199
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,708
[SUZUHA]
It can't be!

200
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,250
Mister Braun! I think
I'm in love with you!

201
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,958
You can't be, it isn't right!

202
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,416
You musn't think of me as a man,

203
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,625
but as Nae's father and
your boss, nothing more!

204
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,375
But someday... You and I...

205
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,833
We could raise her together!
I could be a mother to her!

206
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,250
[BRAUN gasps]

207
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,958
Stupid.

208
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,500
There's no way that's
what's going on here.

209
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,625
What's your problem?

210
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,375
Oh, hi! Uh, nothing! [laughs]

211
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,625
I--I was just daydreaming.

212
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh, I'm gonna go
clean up out front.

213
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,625
Okay, bye, see you later!

214
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,083
Good afternoon.

215
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,125
Yeah? Oh, Okabe, it's just you.

216
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,625
What's up?

217
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,625
You find a new lead about
those attackers or somethin'?

218
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,708
No, sorry.

219
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,541
It's nothing as
important as all that.

220
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,208
[KAGARI]
Hi, Okarin!

221
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,958
So what brings you
into the shop today?

222
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,166
[OKABE] Uh, just came to
see how things are going.

223
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,000
Uh--you mean you came
to check up on me?

224
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,250
Yeah. You're looking quite well.

225
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:08,208
I appreciate you going
out of your way to visit me.

226
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,750
You must be so cold!

227
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,583
[OKABE] No, I'm fine.
I'm also here on an errand.

228
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,333
I've come bearing a
message from Mayuri.

229
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,416
She says that you and
I should go together

230
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,250
to pick out a cell
phone for you.

231
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,041
[KAGARI]
She really said that?

232
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,708
[SUZUHA] What are those
two talking about?

233
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,458
[gasps] It can't be!

234
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,291
You seem chilled to the bone.

235
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,458
[OKABE]
I feel warm now.

236
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,875
Your cheeks are flushed.

237
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,833
I've never seen them so
ruddy before. You see?

238
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,500
[gasps] Your hands.

239
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:36,541
[KAGIRI gasps]
I'm so sorry!

240
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,708
--[OKABE] Kagari. It's fine.
--Your cheeks,

241
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,541
they looked so cold, I had to...

242
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,958
[SUZUHA]
Oh, please, no.

243
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,125
Anything but that.

244
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,166
If that's how this
whole thing turned out,

245
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,833
Mayuri would never forgive me!

246
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,500
She would hate me forever!

247
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,708
Help me!

248
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,166
I have no idea what I'm
supposed to do here!

249
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,250
[FARIS] Thanks for doing
me this favor, meow!

250
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,625
[MAYURI]
Don't mention it!

251
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,166
You know I'd do anything
for a good friend in need!

252
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
And if you're a friend
of Mayushii's,

253
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,333
then we automatically adopt you!

254
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,750
I'm so glad to hear it!

255
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:07,333
Besides, making costumes
is our favorite pastime!

256
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,291
[FUBUKI] By the way, are you
going fully handmade, Mayushii?

257
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:11,666
Yup!

258
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,541
'Cause I think the customers
will appreciate that.

259
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,416
They love when we put
our hearts into it!

260
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,666
C'mon!

261
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,625
You know I'm not talking
about the café costumes.

262
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,958
Chocolate.

263
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:22,291
You're gonna give Okarin
homemade chocolate, right?

264
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,208
Uhh, yeah!

265
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,416
But I have to say,

266
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,916
I've never been
a very good cook,

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,333
so we'll see how it turns out.

268
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,541
[FUBUKI]
Well, in that case,

269
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,791
you should wear this.

270
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,333
It's okay, Okarin.

271
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,333
I can be your
Valentine's dessert.

272
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,375
[MAYURI]
Too-too-roo.

273
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,916
So hot! [laughs]

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,250
Uh, Fubuki?

275
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,333
Sometimes you sound exactly
like Daru, you know?

276
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,625
--[KAEDE, MAYURI chuckle]
--[FUBUKI] I'm so ashamed.

277
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,583
But, Mayuri, if you put
your heart and soul

278
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
into your chocolate,

279
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,125
I have no doubt that Okarin
will love them, no matter what!

280
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,750
[MAYURI]
Mm... I'm not so sure.

281
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,666
[FARIS chuckles]

282
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,208
[KAEDE]
What, Faris?

283
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,541
Mew just leave the
chocolates to Faris!

284
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,583
As of this meow-ment,

285
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:19,291
Let the 36th round table meeting

286
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,666
of Valentine chocolate-
making commence!

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,916
Round table?

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,583
Did she just say meow-ment?

289
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,000
[FARIS]
In other words,

290
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,500
we'll all be helping each other
make handmade chocolate.

291
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,750
Amazing!

292
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,916
That means you've done
this 35 times before?

293
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
[MAHO]
No. That's impossible.

294
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,208
[SUZUHA] I know they
invited me here for this,

295
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,250
Still, it makes no sense.
I don't even have a Valentine.

296
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:42,041
I'm curious about Kagari, but
this whole thing is ridiculous.

297
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm leaving.

298
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,291
Are mew sure about that?

299
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:47,875
If you go, it means no yummy
chocolates for you to taste

300
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,375
when we're done!

301
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,208
[SUZUHA] Those things don't
matter to me. You know that.

302
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,041
[FARIS] Yuki's on her
way over meow, too.

303
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,625
Well, if you insist, I'll stay!

304
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,083
Besides, chocolate
is calorie-dense,

305
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,458
which is valuable in
times of emergency.

306
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,208
I knew you would come around!

307
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,791
All right! Time to get busy
making those chocolates!

308
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,250
[ALL]
Yeah!

309
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,833
Hey. Who are you planning to
give your chocolates to, Nae?

310
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,125
My dad, of course!

311
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,666
Oh, really? Are you
sure you're not gonna

312
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,833
give 'em to some hunky
guy in your class?

313
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,500
No! Don't be ridiculous.

314
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
What about you, Kagari?

315
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,875
My chocolates?

316
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,500
Well, you see...
That's a secret.

317
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,625
Tch.

318
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,916
Aw, come on, Kagari,

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
you've at least gotta
give us a little hint!

320
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,083
[KAGARI giggles]

321
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,166
[FARIS]
It's going exactly as planned.

322
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,625
If we hand out these gorgeous
girls' handmade chocolates

323
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,333
to the May Queen customers
on Valentine's Day,

324
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,750
it'll be a feat of
marketing genius!

325
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,083
What are you doing meow?

326
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,625
Shh! Be quiet!

327
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,166
You're gonna screw me up!

328
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,916
[MAHO yells]
I failed again!

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,916
You don't have to be
perfectly precise, you know.

330
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,833
[MAHO] Baking is a series
of chemical reactions!

331
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,666
An exact science,
with a slim margin of error!

332
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,916
Hey, meow.

333
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,541
Smells like something's burning.

334
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,583
[FARIS screams]

335
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,666
Huh, I wonder how this
could have happened.

336
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,666
You can wonder later!

337
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,916
Right now, just
put out the fire!

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,375
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

339
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,333
[FARIS groans, gasps]

340
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,291
[FARIS]
Meow what'd you do?

341
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,375
I think I...
broke your microwave.

342
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,583
Oh, no!

343
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:29,958
Don't you know you're
not supposed to put

344
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,666
foil in the microwave?

345
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,500
--[explosion]
--Meow?!

346
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,416
Uh-oh.

347
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,208

00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,250
Did they like it?

521
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:08,750
[MAHO]
Nothing. They weren't around.

522
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,625
I was a little late
delivering it to them.

523
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,000
Uh--I don't get it.

524
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,083
Hey. Don't go.

525
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,291
Ma'am!

526
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,583
[MAHO]
These are for me?

527
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,625
[MAKISE] I heard this is
a thing in Japan lately--

528
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,125
giving your
Valentine's chocolate

529
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,583
to a very special friend.

530
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,833
But I don't--

531
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,416
I have nothing for you!

532
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,625
That's okay.

533
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,625
There's always next year.

534
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,583
[MAHO]
Thank you.
