00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,416
[OKABE]
Seriously?

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,750
World War III?

4
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,416
[SUZUHA] Let me put it
into perspective for you:

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,333
that's upwards of 5.7
billion human lives

6
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,625
snuffed out by the year 2036.

7
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,333
And it all starts with this.

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,416
[MAYURI]
But what is "this"?

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,125
[DARU]
Totally a mech.

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,958
Please tell me it transforms.

11
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,500
It's a time machine, Daru.

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,625
--Huh?
--[DARU] Sorry?

13
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,375
You're familiar with it.

14
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,666
That's good, Uncle. Very good.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,458
I can get to the point.

16
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,708
We're gonna run interference.

17
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,000
Uh--

18
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,458
I refuse.

19
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,958
[BOTH gasp]

20
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,625
Okarin.

21
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:55,791
[OKABE] I've been jumping
from world line to world line

22
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:57,291
for weeks.

23
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,666
I've run interference--

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,125
so many times I'm
barely myself anymore.

25
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,458
The only way I was able to
land back onto this world line

26
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,958
was by allowing Kurisu to die.

27
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,791
And now you're asking me
to go another round?

28
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:11,000
I refuse!

29
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:13,750
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,583
Kurisu?

31
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,166
Oh!

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,000
You mean the scientist chick who
got, like, stabbed or whatever

33
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,041
at the Radio Building
the other day?

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,666
Rintarou. Hear me out.

35
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,000
What if I told you the
circumstances of her death

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:31,333
on the afternoon
of July 28th, 2010

37
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,041
play directly into what
kicked off the war?

38
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:37,208
That the reason I'm here
is to see to it she survives?

00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,666
[OKABE gasps]

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,166
[OKABE]
I'm listening.

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,166
I don't have a clue
how it all dovetails.

42
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,666
All I know is I've
been entrusted

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,416
with an important mission:

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,333
rescue Makise Kurisu and
shift things to a world line

45
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:53,250
beyond the divergence barrier,
free of the attractor field.

46
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,625
A little place we
call Stei's Gate.

47
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,500
[OKABE]
I don't believe it.

48
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,541
You actually hatched
this plan yourself.

49
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,708
By that I mean you will.

50
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,291
With Dad.

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,000
Though you're the first to
admit it's pure conjecture.

52
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,250
Push comes to shove,

53
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,291
it's possible this is
all wishful thinking.

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,291
Even if a Steins Gate
world line exists,

55
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,791
the odds of us reaching
one are slim to none.

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
Odds be damned,
though. I'm all in.

57
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,791
As you always like to remind us:

58
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,791
nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?

59
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,583
If a future without World War
III is worth the risk to you,

60
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,958
take my hand.

61
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,083
[MAYURI]
Um... Okay, to be honest,

62
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:16,500
I don't think I understood very
much of what just got said.

63
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:17,875
But...

64
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,583

65
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,500
This Makise Kurisu?

66
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:24,375
Sounds to me like she's worth
taking a chance, right?

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,041
I say you should go for it!

68

[DARU] Face it, chief.
It's your cuppa tea.

stuff seems, well,

no offense, you understand,

but tailor-made for your
special brand of crazy.

[SUZUHA]
Well, yeah.

79
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,916

would've have skimped on

five ways from Tuesday

if it crossed signals
with the one

your past self'll be carrying.

00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,083
Watch it for me?

00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,208

Mm.

I've already stopped
off at 1975 and 2000.

93

She's running low on fuel,
though. That's the thing.

94
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,750
You've got to watch the
indicators like a hawk.

95
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,250
[gasps] Wait. So we can not
only go backward in time,

96
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,083
but forward?

97
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,291
Uh--I should hope so.

98
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,125
What the in hell'd be
the point if we couldn't?

99
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,250
[OKABE]
I see. This one must come from

100
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,625
a different world
line than its twin.

101
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,208
[SUZUHA]
Have a seat.

00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,833
I'm setting coordinates for the
day of, just shy of 12 o'clock.

103
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,125
I don't dare go back any further

104
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,083
because I can't
change our position.

105
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,833
If we stir up trouble
at the Radio Building,

106
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:55,375
it might throw Kurisu's
movements out of whack.

107
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,416
We're about to pull an
ungodly amount of Gs here,

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,416
so you might want to
prepare yourself.

114

They come with the territory.

avoid running into your
past self at all costs.

We could have a major paradox
on our hands otherwise.

think this'll take?

Uh, well...maybe 20
minutes, give or take?

127
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,833
All right, I'm gonna stay here
and prep the time machine

what you can to save Makise.

floor, soaked in her own blood.

132
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,833
Mayuri and I had come to
see Dr. Nakabachi's lecture

133
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:09,916
and were waiting for it to start

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,333
when we heard a
sound on the roof.

[OKABE]
That's right.

138
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,750
This must be when Mayuri
heads to the vending machines

139
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,125
on the 7th floor.

140
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,541

Is anything not an emergency?

141

[MAYURI]
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,375
I know sometimes it's not,
but this one counts for sure.

143
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,750
[OKABE]
Better play it safe.

144
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,791
I'll take the far
stairs back to eight.

145
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,875
I don't believe it!
A metal Oopa!

146

And that's good?

148

Um, have we met before?

00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,750
[OKABE]
No. This is too much.

154
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:07,083
I don't think I know you, do I?

00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:07,916

[MAKISE]
What is your trauma?

158
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,250
Don't rush to
help me or anything.

I, uh...

Your attention, please.

Doctor Nakabachi's conference
is about to begin

165
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,916
on the 8th floor lecture hall.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,125
All who are interested
are welcome...

167
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,458

At least finish a sentence!

[MAKISE sighs]

[NAKABACHI] Printed on the
handouts there in front of you

170
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,291
is more or less
the hard blueprint

171
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,833
for one of mankind's
oldest ambitions.

172
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,791
Of course, the
theoretical scaffolding

173
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,666
begs some explanation.

174
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:47,916
[NAKABACHI]
As I'm sure you're aware,

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
mainstream science currently...

00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,583
[SUZUHA]
In the brief I was given,

177
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,541
they said you'd be able
to pick her out instantly.

178
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,791
Is that true?

179
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:54,833
[OKABE]
Yeah.

180
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,375
[SUZUHA]
Right. Bear in mind, though.

181
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,458
It's probably a bad idea
to take her off site.

182
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,291
We don't know who
kills her or why.

183
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:01,500
And in the event
that her death is

184
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,875
a fixed point on the timeline,

185
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
we don't want things
getting more complicated.

186
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,833
I learned that the
hard way with Mayuri.

187

[NAKABACHI]
Save your questions unt--

191
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,208
[OKABE]
I have none, sir!

192
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:14,791
I throw down the gauntlet as
to your "theory's" authorship!

193
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:17,208
Do you take us all for
babes in the wilderness?

194

Please. World lines?
Kerr Black...

195
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,000
[OKABE] Any moment now,
this is where she'll end up.

196
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,708
What on earth am I gonna do?

197
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,208
[gasps] Wait!

198
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,958
What if she's killed somewhere
else and dragged here?

199
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,041
Damn it! I hadn't
thought of that!

200

[OKABE gasps]

202
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,791
[OKABE]
There she is.

203
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,208
[OKABE]
This is where it happens.

204
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,041
[OKABE]
What is that she's reading?

205
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,375
[OKABE]
Time machines?

206
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,000
Is that why so much
is riding on this?

207
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,833
--[footsteps]
--[MAKISE] Uh--

208
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,250
[NAKABACHI]
Stupid kids.

[MAKISE gasps]

210
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,875
What in the hell do you want?

211
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,083
Look, please.

212
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,500
I just want you to
read this, 'kay, Dad?

213
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,625
[OKABE]
"Dad"?

214
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,166
[OKABE gasps]
Nakabachi's her dad?!

215
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,208
Look, I... I'm just trying
to bury the hatchet.

216
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:16,708
It's been years. Too damn long.

217
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,916
I want you in my life again.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,875
[OKABE] Don't tell me
her father's the one who--

219
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,250
[MAKISE] ...as you
like to say, and well,

220
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,208
I'm now convinced that
you were right all along.

221
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,708
I wanted your opinion
on the theory.

222
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,541
If this paper gets accepted,

223
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,625
you can lord it over
all the stuffed shirts

224
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,083
who laughed you
out of the academy.

225
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,416
[NAKABACHI gasps]
I did not get "laughed out"!

226
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,041
I turned my back
on their politics

227
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,208
to pursue my
researches unfettered!

228
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,125
[MAKISE]
Sorry.

229
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,125
[NAKABACHI]
Hmph.

230
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,041
[NAKABACHI]
This isn't half bad.

231
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,625
[MAKISE]
Really?

232
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,416
'Cause I was thinking, maybe,
if you were okay with the idea,

233
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,750
we could publish it
under both of our names.

234
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,875
I mean, after all,

235
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,291
you're the one who
inspired me to--

236
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,541
[NAKABACHI]
Don't be ridiculous.

237
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,541
Go home.

238
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,916
[MAKISE]
What?

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,083
[NAKABACHI] If this paper
sees the light of day,

240
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,583
it'll do so under my name.

241
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,833
[MAKISE]
Uh--excuse me?

242
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,750
That's called stealing!

243
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
I knew you could be cruel,

244
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,125
but I never thought
you'd stoop to--

245
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,125
[NAKABACHI]
Shut up!

right to outshine her father!

00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,250
I can't do it.

350
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,500
[SUZUHA]
That is not true.

351
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,750
You can at least
try more than once!

352
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,041
[OKABE]
Once?

353
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,666
[OKABE]
Are you mad?

354
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,333
I tried dozens of times!
No, double--triple that!

355
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,208
And every time, I failed!

356
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,833
[OKABE]
I know how cruel time can be.

357
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,666
You may not think that's true,
but believe me, I do.

358
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,875
We like to imagine we can bend
it to suit us, when really--

359
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,458
[OKABE]
Really...

360
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,208
[OKABE]
This was bound to happen.

361
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,000
It was stupid of me
to play along.

362
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,416
I'm sorry, but...

363
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm just done.

364
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,708
Let time have its way.

365
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,416
No! If I have to slap some sense
into you, I'll be happy to--

366
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,791
[MAYURI]
Please, stop it!

367
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,333
It isn't fair for you
to force him like this!

368
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,291
--[gasps]
--[OKABE sobbing]

369
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:07,375
--[OKABE sobbing]

370
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,500
[SUZUHA]
But at this rate,

371
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,500
we won't be able to
change the future!

372
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,458
[MAYURI]
And why?

373
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,625
Why does Okarin have to carry
the weight of the future

374
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,208
all by himself?

375
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,875
It's too much for him.

376
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,875
[SUZUHA] Because Uncle
Okarin has an ability

377
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,500
that lets him observe and
remember the world lines.

378
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,791
[MAYURI] But Okarin never
asked for that responsibility.

379
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,791
Look what it's done to him.

380
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,625
If he tries again, he's only
going to end up hurt more.

381
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,458
[MAYURI] Besides,
it's probably impossible

382
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,375
for one person to change
the future, anyway.

383
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,541
[OKABE]
I'm sorry... Kurisu...

384
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,583
[OKABE]
Kuri...

385
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,791
[OKABE sobbing]

386
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,916
[MAYURI]
Hey, Okarin?

387
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,958
[OKABE sobbing]

388
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,958
[MAYURI] You don't have to
push yourself so hard anymore.

389
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,333
And it's okay to cry.

390
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,666
Really.

391
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,458
[MAYURI]
Because I'm here.

392
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,916
I've got you.

393
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,541
[MAKISE]
Okabe.

394
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,750
Jeez, seriously.

395
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,541
You're nothing but trouble,
you know that?

396
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,541
Give it here. I keep
a sewing kit on me.

397
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,375
I can get it fixed up
for you in a jiff.

398
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,750
Okabe!

399
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,375
As you've probably noticed,
it's kinda dark in here,

400
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,375
so don't expect needlework
worthy of Athena.

401
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,958
Okabe.

402
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,333
I'd say what color thread I'm
using, 'cept I can't even tell.

403
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,583
[cicadas singing]

404
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:16,541
[MAKISE]
Jeez, seriously.

405
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,375
Okabe?

406
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,333
...you know that?

407
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,250
Give it here. I keep

Okabe.

00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,041
I'd say what color thread I'm
using, 'cept I can't even tell.

...seriously. You're nothing
but trouble, you know that?

415
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,583
Give it here. I keep a sewing...

416
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:39,666
Okabe.

417

...get it fixed up
for you in a jiff.

As you've probably noticed,
it's kinda dark in here,

00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,083
Okabe?

00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,708

...in a jiff.

00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,458
As you've probably noticed,
it's kinda dark in here...

428
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,583
Okabe!

429
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,208
...worthy of Athena.

430
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,500
I'd say what color thread I'm
using, 'cept I can't even tell.

431
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,791
[MAYURI]
The cicadas have all gone away.

432
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,583
[OKABE] It's been a while
since I've been to this park.

433
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,583
Yeah. It sounds to me like
you've been super busy

434
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,416
ever since summer break ended.

435
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,958
[OKABE chuckles]
Actually, the other day

436
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,250
I went on my first group date.

437
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,916
You did?

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,291
--[cell phone vibrates]
--[OKABE chuckles]

439
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,916
Ah. Speak of the devil.

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,208
Hey, what's up?

441
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,041
Yeah? Tomorrow?

442
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,833
Sure. Maybe.

443
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,166
Let me guess.

444
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,208
You need a guy to
even out the numbers.

445
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,625
Right?

446
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,375
[chuckles]

447
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,291
Whatever.

448
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,541
I'll be there.

449
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,333
See you.

450
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,666
Turns out college life is busier
than I expected. [chuckles]

451
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,541
[MAYURI]
It's been too long.

452
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:37,041
[MAYURI] But seeing Okarin
again... makes me feel so happy.

453
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,375
Hey. Wait up.

454
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,000
[MAYURI] Will you stop
in the lab sometime?

455
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,500
You haven't been by in forever

456
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,958
and it's been so
quiet without you.

457
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:12,916
Yeah, I will.

458
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
That's a promise, okay?

459
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,583
Sure. See you around.

460
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:19,708
[MAYURI]
Yup!

461
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,041
[OKABE]
Mayuri is fine.

462
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,041
Still alive.

463
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,875
The city? Remains.

464
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,458
And me?

465
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,083
Nothing has changed.

466
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,208
Nice to meet you.

467
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm Makise Kurisu.

468
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,333
It's a pleasure.

[OKABE gasps]
Kurisu.

470
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:22,041
Kurisu.

471
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,375
Kurisu...

472
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:28,708
Kurisu... Kurisu... Kurisu...

473
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:32,208
Is this how fate intends
our paths to converge?

474
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,583
Well? Hououin Kyouma?

475
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,333
[OKABE] After everything
that's happened--

476
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,333
the horrors I've gone through.

477
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,375
I have to do it after all.
