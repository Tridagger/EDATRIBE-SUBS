1
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,041
[MAHO]
Okabe?

2
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,000
What are you doing
here so early?

3
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,958
Hiyajo, listen.

4
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,666
I have a question for you.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, what?

6
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,083
Have you forsaken your silly
mad-scientist voice?

7
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,583
[OKABE] Our D-RINE worked,
and Amadeus was lost,

8
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,458
but we still met Hiyajo.

9
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,791
Apparently under very
different circumstances.

10
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:46,833
[inaudible]

11
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,875
[OKABE] Even as the world
lines keep changing,

12
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,166
our connections remain constant,

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,916
as if the conditions
reshape themselves

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,541
to support the
relationships we've built.

15
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:59,500
[phone vibrates]

16
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:00,583
[OKABE]
Hey, Mayuri.

17
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,708
[MAYURI]
Hello? You there? It's Suzuha.

18
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,500
She's in some major trouble!

19
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,375
[OKABE]
Suzuha?

20
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:06,500
[MAYURI]
Yeah!

21
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:07,708
She's about to get
in the time machine

22
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,583
to go back one year
into the past!

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,333
She's leaving, even though
she can't come back!

24
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,625
Damn it all, why?

25
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,625
[MAYURI]
What?

26
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,750
Why'd you have to
make the choice

27
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:18,208
to talk to me about it, huh?

28
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:20,000
There's not enough time.

29
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:21,708
I can't even investigate
the situation

30
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,250
and find out exactly
what's changed.

31
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,375
There's only one element
that matters now:

32
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,375
They must leave
in the time machine.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
[OKABE]
Kagari?

34
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,708
She's way too early!

35
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,208
What's this about?

36
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,708
[OKABE] Kagari's still going
after the time machine.

37
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,291
Which means I've
gotta find her,

38
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,333
and stop her in her tracks.

39
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:48,041
[ALEXIS]
Rintaro.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,750
[ALEXIS] What business
could you possibly have

41
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,375
in a place like this?

42
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,958
You know my suspicion?

43
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,125
I think you know far more
about the time machine

44
00:01:58,208 --> 00:01:59,750
than I gave you credit for.

45
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,583
Is my assessment correct?

46
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,541
[ALEXIS]
Where's Kagari?

47
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,666
I know after she
escaped the facility

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,458
that she met up with you
and your little lab crew,

49
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,250
so don't even try denying it.

50
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,166
You can't fool me. How much
of the truth do you know?

51
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,625
[OKABE]
I see.

52
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,833
Things are different because
the D-RINE erased Amadeus.

53
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,166
Is it possible that
the professor

54
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,833
wasn't able to
fully brainwash Kagari?

55
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,375
[OKABE grunts]
If that's true...

56
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,791
Professor Leskinen.
You're right.

57
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,916
I know things about the future

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,333
that you couldn't
begin to imagine.

59
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,125
Would you like to hear
about them?

60
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,000
[OKABE]
I'll tell you everything.

61
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,625
[OKABE]
Moeka!

62
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:39,666
[gunshot]

63
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,708
--[OKABE groans]
--[MOEKA] Huh?

64
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,416
[MOEKA]
Are you all right?

65
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, I'm fine,
it's just a scratch.

66
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,000
You need help!

67
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
[OKABE]
There's no time for that!

68
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,375
I need your help now.
As lab member 005!

69
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,125
Kiryu Moeka!

70
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,500
[whimpering]

71
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,125
[REYES]
Please, don't do this!

72
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,291
Kaga--

73
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,333
Kagari.

74
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,583
[KAGARI] I won't allow
the past to be changed.

75
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,583
I will not let anyone erase
the day that I met Mommy.

76
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:26,291
Nobody's getting it.
I'll destroy the time machine.

77
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,625
Suzuha. Is that really Kagari?

78
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:33,250
But, why?

79
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,541
[KAGARI]
Mommy Mayuri.

80
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,791
Are you a part of all of this?

81
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:38,375
Do you wanna change
the future, too,

82
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,666
just like Suzuha has been
trying to do for so many years?

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Do you wanna make it so
that you and I never meet,

84
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,250
and you don't become my mom?

85
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,708
No, it's not that at all.

86
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,708
[KAGARI] Because that's
the last thing I want!

87
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,916
However terrible the future
might be... I don't even care!

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,250
It's the only reality I want.

89
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,083
I won't let you change it!

90
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,000
[gasps]

91
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,958
[gasps]

92
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,041
What's the matter, Kagari?
You afraid to do it?

93
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,458
I will shoot!

94
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:27,791
[MAYURI]
Kagari, please.

95
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,791
Stop. Let her go.

96
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,458
It's dangerous, Mommy,
stay back! I can't let her go.

97
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,833
I have to do this!

98
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,166
[gasps]

99
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,833
No, Mayuri!

100
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,833
Please, get back!

101
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,166
Oh my goodness.
That was scary.

102
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,041
I just realized I was holding
my breath the entire time!

103
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:51,375
I'm just grateful it worked,

104
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,958
and that you both decided
not to shoot each other.

105
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,375
--Mommy? But I...
--Listen.

106
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,125
Don't be sad.

107
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,833
You see, even though I am
getting in the time machine,

108
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,833
and I'm going back
into the past with Suzuha,

109
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,041
I'm only doing this

110
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,916
to make someone special
to me see the light.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,541
It's not gonna work!

112
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,750
No matter what you both do,

113
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,875
or how hard you try,
nothing ever works!

114
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,291
No good can come of it!

115
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,000
It will only keep us apart!

116
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:23,000
There's only enough fuel
left to go one way!

117
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
You won't be able to come back!

118
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,041
What'll happen to you? I don't
even want to think about it.

119
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,458
[MAYURI]
I understand.

120
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,208
This might be reckless,
and it could be hopeless, too.

121
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,083
But still, it's worth
it for Okarin.

122
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,958
He has a special power
to change the future.

123
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,750
Well, no.

124
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,583
I think we all have
that same power,

125
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,708
but he's learned to use it
in a different way

126
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,000
to guide us to
the best future possible.

127
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,541
Which is why I'm going,

128
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,041
to give him that extra little
push he needs to go back

129
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,750
and change something important.

130
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,750
And if that's all it takes,
I know I can do it.

131
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,166
It's the only thing I can do.

132
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,208
Orihime's gift to Hikoboshi.

133
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,125
Hikoboshi? But wait.

134
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:10,208
[MAYURI] If my Hikoboshi had
burned bright just once more,

135
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,333
it might've changed
everything for us.

136
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,791
He's Mommy's... Hikoboshi?

137
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,375
[SUZUHA] Kagari, why don't
you come with us?

138
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,916
[KAGARI gasps]

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,166
Come back into the past with us.
We can change the future!

140
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,416
The world doesn't have to
fall apart or be sad,

141
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,541
and no one you love
has to die, either!

142
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,375
We can create a beautiful,
bright future instead,

143
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,291
one where everyone
can be happy together!

144
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,458
[MAYURI]
Well, then? Come on, Kagari.

145
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,458
Let's be together!

146
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,708
Really?

147
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,708
[OKABE]
Do it for my sake, too!

148
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:48,125
[MAYURI]
Okarin? And Moeka?

149
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,750
[SUZUHA]
What are you doing here?

150
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,750
Listen. I came to this
time from the future.

151
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,000
[ALL gasp]

152
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,791
[OKABE] I did it using
the time leap machine.

153
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,208
This place is about
to become a war zone.

154
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,541
You don't have very long.

155
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:01,333
You have to get in and go, now!

156
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,500
[KAGARI] That can't be! The
professor shouldn't even know--

157
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,250
Leskinen is currently
unconscious in the stairwell.

158
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,208
But it's only a matter of time.

159
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,125
You'll let us leave?

160
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,458
[gasps]

161
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,333
Now, Lab Member 002,
Shiina Mayuri!

162
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,083
Please, make Operation
Arclight a success!

163
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,541
And when I'm mired
in self-pity,

164
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,208
knock some sense into me, huh?

165
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,208
[gasps]

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:32,916
'Kay! I promise I will!

167
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,291
Come on, Kagari. Let's go!

168
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,000
[KAGARI]
Mommy.

169
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,500
[gunfire]

170
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:41,333
Moeka!

171
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,791
I can't hold them long.

172
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,916
Hurry up!

173
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,625
You have to come now, Kagari!

174
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,041
Mommy. I...

175
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,333
[KAGARI]
Okarin.

176
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,875
Are you certain?

177
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,458
You're okay with never
seeing Mommy again?

178
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,458
Won't that break your heart?

179
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
What are you blabbering about?

180
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,208
Mayuri is my precious
hostage, you know.

181
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,166
No matter where or when
she may venture,

182
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,083
I will always bring her back!

183
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,208
[chuckles]

184
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,833
[SUZUHA]
Kagari!

185
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,625
Aren't you coming?

186
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,958
Go! They won't get anywhere
near you! I'll protect you!

187
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,708
But, Kagari!

188
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,541
[KAGARI]
Hurry! Leave!

189
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:27,041
Mayuri, let's go!

190
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,041
Get in!

191
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,375
[KAGARI]
You're Mommy's Hikoboshi!

192
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,875
I'm trusting you.

193
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,458
I choose to, because you said
I can be with Mommy again.

194
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,208
That's a promise!

195
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,125
[inaudible]

196
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,208
[OKABE]
It showed up after all.

197
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,458
Okabe, no!

198
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,791
Mommy!

199
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,375
[OKABE]
I understand.

200
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,625
[OKABE] This time...
there's nothing to fear!

201
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:13,416
[OKABE]
This is it. This moment!

202
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:47,416
[OKABE laughing]

203
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,291
Attend me well,
for I won't suffer fools!

204
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,583
Schrodinger's box
has shattered wide open!

205
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,875
The time machine you bastards
sought no longer exists!

206
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,458
It has traveled
through space-time

207
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,250
and dissolved into the ether
along with your schemes!

208
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,375
Writhe with anguish. Tremble
in fear, for you should!

209
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,166
I, Hououin Kyouma, will prevail
against you and your designs.

210
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,833
Indeed, fate itself
will kneel at my feet!

211
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:12,708
Nothing will deter me.

212
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,125
I'll find Steins Gate!
Do you hear?

213
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,541
For that...

214
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,583
[OKABE chuckling]

215
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,416
...is what I have chosen!

216
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,541
[OKABE grunts]

217
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,750
[MAYURI]
Huh? What's that?

218
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:33,833
[DARU]
Hold up.

219
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:36,208
Are there two time machines?

220
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,666
[gasps]

221
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,000
[MAYURI]
A call from myself?

222
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,333
[DARU]
Huh?

223
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,958
What's going on?

224
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,166
[MAYURI]
I guess I'll answer it.

225
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,375
Uh, hello?

226
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,625
Who's this?

227
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:58,791
Please, don't be afraid,
I need you to hear me out.

228
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,833
[MAYURI gasps]

229
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,833
Do you love Hououin Kyouma?

230
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,416
Truly?

231
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Exactly one minute
from right now,

232
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,916
Okarin will come back
from the past.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,541
But he didn't succeed
in saving Makise Kurisu.

234
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,833
[MAYURI gasps]

235
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,458
[MAYURI]
So that means...

236
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,125
...no matter what it takes,

237
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,541
you're going to have to
confront your Hikoboshi.

238
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,583
You're the only one
who can open his eyes.

239
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,000
My Hikoboshi?

240
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,000
[gasps]

241
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,666
[MAYURI]
Yes.

242
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,750
[BOTH]
Hououin Kyouma.

243
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,416
Okarin's heart will
be shattered,

244
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,041
but you can get him
on his feet again.

245
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,416
It's gonna take more than just
speaking his name, though.

246
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,125
Thirty seconds to go!

247
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,541
[MAYURI]
Think of the exact moment

248
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,375
Hououin Kyouma came into being,
do you remember that?

249
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,500
[gasps]

250
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,416
[MAYURI]
The moment he came into being?

251
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,458
Yes, I remember.

252
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,541
[MAYURI] I'm entrusting
you with 27 years' worth

253
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,708
of love and pain.

254
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,625
You'll have to endure so much.

255
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,041
But I won't stop believing...

256
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,625
...in my Okarin...

257
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,916
...in our friends,
and in myself.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,958
So, please, never
give up hope, either.

259
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,125
Because the rest
is in your hands.

260
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,291
Too-too-roo!

261
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,416
Hold on! I--

262
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,666
Mayuri, it's time!
We have to go!

263
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,041
Please, just tell me!
Does Steins Gate really exist?

264
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,833
[MAYURI]
It does I'm sure of it.

265
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,125
And now the second time
machine's gone, too?

266
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,791
Wait, who was that on the phone?

267
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,083
[alarm blaring]

268
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:36,041
[SUZUHA]
It's no use, Mayuri.

269
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,666
I'm sorry, but there's
not much hope.

270
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,791
[MAYURI]
I see.

271
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,500
Because there's
no fuel left, right?

272
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,125
If we had stayed, it would've
caused a time paradox,

273
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,458
so we had to jump.

274
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,083
I hate to say it, but this
might be the end for us.

275
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,666
There's no telling what time
we might be shot into.

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,291
One year later, or a
million back, I can't say.

277
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,125
[MAYURI]
Thank you, Suzuha.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
Why would you thank me?

279
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,750
Thank you so much for letting me
come along with you like this.

280
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,416
And don't worry!

281
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,125
I'm confident the other Mayuri

282
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,541
and my Hikoboshi can take
care of things from here.

283
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,958
I'm so jealous of Uncle
Okarin right now, you know?

284
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,166
If I had Reading
Steiner like him,

285
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,875
then I could remember
everything.

286
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,708
Even when world lines changed.

287
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:25,583
Like talking to
this version of you,

288
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,833
who is younger than me,
and everything about this time.

289
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,708
It's weird to think I won't talk
to you for another six years.

290
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,541
Wait, even longer.

291
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,000
Unless you happen to start
talking right after you're born!

292
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,208
[laughs]

293
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,750
[BOTH laughing]

294
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,000
[MAYURI]
Hey, Okarin.

295
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,791
When the world seems like
it's fallen into darkness...

296
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,583
...and you're afraid of
the shadows all around...

297
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,458
...try not to close your eyes.

298
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,625
Don't ever give up.

299
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,125
And promise you won't let
Hououin Kyouma die.

300
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:03,958
That way, my feelings
can still reach your heart.

301
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:06,166
Even if they have to
travel for hundreds,

302
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,041
even thousands of hours,

303
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:11,208
like the light
of some distant star....

304
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,291
I will wait in the lab,
no matter how long it takes

305
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,791
for you and all the
others to join me.

306
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:20,375
And when you do,
we'll be together at last.

307
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,833
[MAYURI] I'll see you again
in Steins Gate!

308
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,458
[MAYURI]
Okarin!

309
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,916
[OKABE]
I killed her...

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,166
He's gonna be all right.

311
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,458
It's just a little bit
complicated.

312
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,250
[MAYURI]
Okarin.

314
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,250
Okarin, it's your phone.

315

[DARU]
A text?

316
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,375
[SUZUHA]
Open it.

317
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,083
[MAYURI]
I shouldn't.

318
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,250
[SUZUHA]
Just do it.

319
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:46,041
[OKABE]
I'm responsible for her death.

320
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,083
I'm responsible...

321
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,791
[MAYURI]
It says to turn on the news.

322
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,750
[DARU]
Seriously?

323
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,416
[REPORTER]
Despite the cargo bay fire,

324
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,791
Doctor Nakabachi's plane
managed to land safely

325
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,958
within the borders
of the former Soviet Union,

326
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,541

I know it is!

00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,250
[DARU]
Why's it in Russia?

330
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,458
[SUZUHA]
That thesis of his.

331
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,208
That's what starts
World War III.

332
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,958
It basically sparks
an arms race,

333
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,750
only the goal is which country
can build a time machine first.

334
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,833
Take first place
and win the world.

335
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,750
That's how it starts, but things
get hostile pretty quick.

336
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,541
The lives of 5.7 billion
people are at stake here.

337
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,875
Save Makise Kurisu and
you save every one of them.

338
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,458
I can't do it.

339
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,166
Things'll end up just
as they did with Mayuri.

340
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,541
No matter what I did, she died.

341
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,833
[MAYURI]
Think of the exact moment

342
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,541
Hououin Kyouma came into being!

343
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,625
Do you remember that?

344
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:38,541
[OKABE]
Believe me, I know.

345
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:39,625
You may not think I do,

346
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:43,000
but I know how
cruel time can be.

347
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:48,166
We like to imagine we can
bend it to suit us, but...

348
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,000
...this was bound to happen.

349
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,791
It was stupid of me
to play along.

350
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,916
I'm sorry, but I'm...

351
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,416
...I'm just done.

352
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,250
Let time have its way.

353
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,375
[gasps]

354
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:11,791
[inaudible]

355
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,625
[OKABE]
Hail and well met...

356
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,416
...old friend.

357
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,958
That you're able to open
this means you've seen it.

358
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,166
You've seen firsthand
what became of Makise

359
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,083
and failed to prevent it.

360
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,833
I feel for you.
Believe me, I do.

361
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,375
That said, the pain you're going
through right now is necessary.

362
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:42,666
I daren't deny you--us...
the bitter inspiration

363
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,083
it represents.

364
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,708
Without it, you cannot hope
to carve out your destiny.

365
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:52,500
Now we can marshal
our resources properly.

366
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,083
I hereby charge you with the
task of reaching Steins Gate.

367
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,125
The target world line's
charming little nickname

368
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,666
comes care of me as well,

369
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,791
which is to say,
it comes from you.

370
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,375
Care to guess its significance?

371
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,833
Bingo. There's none.

372
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
[MAHO]
Hey, are you sure about this?

373
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,958
[DARU]
Yeah, for the most part.

374
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,958
[MAHO] Don't you think
the Okabe in 2010

375
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,625
will be humiliated
by the whole thing?

376
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,083
No need to worry about that.

377
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,041
He was even more
incredible back then.

378
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,041
Just thinking about it
makes me shudder.

379
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,125
[OKABE] And to further
please our whimsy,

380
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,333
Operation Skuld will be the name
we assign to this mission.

381
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,125
Forge of yesterday whatever
you must to save the future.

382
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,541
Deceive yourself
in every last detail.

383
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,500
Deceive the world.

384
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,875
Do this, and victory is assured.

385
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,041
Best of luck to you, old friend.

386
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,833
El. Psy. Congroo.

387
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:46,708
[FARIS]
Cut!

388
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,875
Nice job! You nailed it! Meow!

389
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,208
[OKABE]
Now the final step.

390
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,375
We have to send the video
in a D-mail to the past.

391
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,041
Ruka.

392
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,416
On it.

393
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,625
The video that you just made
goes to Kyouma in 2010,

394
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,375
and the one Hashida
already filmed,

395
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,500
that goes to Suzuha in 2011,

396
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,333
right after you depart on
your trip, is that right?

397
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:08,375
[MAHO]
You really wanna do this?

398
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,625
[OKABE]
Yes, why?

399
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:11,708
Because you'll be manning
the inaugural run

400
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,375
of an experimental time machine.

401
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,750
[MAHO] You've told me you're
supposed to die in 2025,

402
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,291
I get that,

403
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,208
but it doesn't mean it's okay
for you to just throw your--

404
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,500
[OKABE] I have no intention
of doing anything of the sort.

405
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,041
I fully believe our efforts
here will pay off.

406
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,125
Yeah, but...

407
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,166
What if you interpret
it differently?

408
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,708
In 2025, Okabe Rintaro doesn't
perish like we thought.

409
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,083
Instead, he boards the first
version of our time machine

410
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:44,583
and departs for another
corner of space-time.

411
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,833
If I were to disappear from
this world line, well, then...

412
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
...that's essentially
the same as dying here.

413
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,166
Wouldn't you agree?

414
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
[MAHO] I'd call that mindset
overly optimistic.

415
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,416
[OKABE] Emotions aside,
it's a viable theory, is it not?

416
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,708
[chuckles]

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,875
[OKABE]
The world can be deceived.

418
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:05,500
My friends! I thank you for
following my lead until now!

419
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,750
As you know... on that
day, in the year 2011,

420
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:12,291
a time machine departed
for the past and was lost.

421
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,583
I venture into the abyss
to find Mayuri and Suzuha.

422
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,958
With the Kerr black hole tracer,

423
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll be able to home
in on their locus.

424
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,625
With luck, it will lead me
straight to where they are.

425
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,833
[KAGARI]
Okarin.

426
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,916
[KAGURI]
Take this.

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,416
[OKABE]
Are you sure?

428
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,333
I am. Please give it to Mommy
when you find her, for me.

429
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,291
Yes, I promise.

430
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,416
[MAHO] I just have to
ask you one last time.

431
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,750
About Steins Gate.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,125
Does it exist?

433
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,916
And can we reach it?

434
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,750
[OKABE]
It exists. We'll find it.

435
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,416
As of now, the operation
commences!

436
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,958
Operation Altair!

437
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,958
That is the name by which
it shall be known!

438
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you think that he'll succeed?

439
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,291
'Course he will.

440
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,166
If anyone can do it, Kyouma can.

441
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,791
Yeah, I'm with Faris.

442
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,791
He's special.

443
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,416
Nothing's out of his reach.

444
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,541
Exactly right.

445
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,625
Okarin makes the
impossible possible.

446
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
Good luck, Okarin.

447
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,458
[MAHO] The universe may not
have a discernible end.

448
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,625
It's infinite,

449
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,500
but it had a beginning.

450
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:41,500
And as for its component
parts, the stars,

451
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,958
those definitely have a limited
cosmological shelf life.

452
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,541
They're finite.

453
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,083
If history tells us anything,

454
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,333
it's that scientists
often make very poor poets.

455
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,041
We're a ship of fools,
chasing phantoms,

456
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,875
heedless of what
underwrites natural law.

457
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,458
If we could somehow
attain that wisdom,

458
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,708
perhaps it would only plunge
us into madness and ruin.

459
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,208
Humans exceeding
the speed of light?

460
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,000
It's more foolish
than fish attempting

461
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,291
to make a life on land.

462
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,916
And yet...

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
...these words.

464
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,375
They're meant for those
foolhardy enough

465
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,708
to defy the counsels of fate.

466
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,375
An epigraph for
their obstinance.

467
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,500
[inaudible]

468
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,458
Suzuha!

469
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:26,833
[laughs]

470
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,875
Did you doubt me, my loves?
