[OKABE panting]

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,166
[Daru]
Suzuha!

8
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,875
Oh, it's you, Dad.

9
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,250
Just what in the hell
are you doing

10
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,083
still out in this downpour?

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,458
[OKABE] It's been several months
since Kagari vanished.

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,000
We tried everything
we could to track her down.

13
00:00:57,083 --> 00:00:59,958
Any means necessary, but alas.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,791
[OKABE] In the end, there was
just no trace of her anywhere.

15
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,000
As for the facility
Moeka and I found,

16
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:11,250
we never uncovered
its exact purpose.

17
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:17,375
She was brainwashed?
Are you kidding me?

18
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,500
[DARU] We don't have
definitive proof, though.

19
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,416
[SUZUHA gasps]

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,875
[OKABE] We couldn't reveal
the truth about Kagari's past.

21
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:28,458
So, enlisting the help of the
authorities seemed pointless.

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,916
[rain falling]

23
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,833
[MAYURI]
Okarin!

24
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:37,583
[OKABE]
Mayuri?

25
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,458
Are you gonna be okay, silly?

26
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,791
[OKABE]
Huh?

27
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,000
I was just wondering
if you brought an umbrella.

28
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,916
This rain comes out of nowhere.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,041
It sure does seem
that way lately.

30
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:48,750
[MAYURI]
Because it's the rainy season.

31
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,208
That's how it always is.

32
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,791
Of course.

33
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,333
It's going to
be summer pretty soon.

34
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,833
Oh, yeah. Right. Huh?

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,333
[MAYURI]
I love summer.

36
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,708
[OKABE]
Yeah.

37
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,291
[mouse clicks]

38
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,166
Uh. Hey, hot stuff!

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,125
--You're lookin' sexy.
--[MAHO yawns]

40
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,333
[MAHO]
Good morning.

41
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:49,083
Hiyajo. Hi. How's it goin'?

42
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:49,958
[MAHO groans]

43
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,500
[DARU]
A sleepy Mini Maho?

44
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,875
That's effing hot!

45
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,291
[MAHO moans]

46
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,458
So, I'm assuming you guys
still haven't given up,

47
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,333
since you're
contacting me again.

48
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,666
Of course we haven't!

49
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,208
Like I already told you,

50
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:04,958
if we end up not being able
to use the actual time machine,

51
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,708
then we'll be forced to recreate
the time leap machine!

52
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,875
And you really think
that's possible?

53
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,458
[DARU]
I was almost able to finish it

54
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,666
before Okarin freaked out
and trashed the thing,

55
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,041
so, yeah, I do.

56
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,166
But it's not even close
to being stable.

57
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,916
--I'm not surprised.
--[keyboard clacking]

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,083
How'd they compress
such an absurd amount of data

59
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,333
in order to send it
into the past?

60
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,375
Until you answer that question,
it seems pointless.

61
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,791
Why do you think we're asking
for your help again?

62
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,416
Because we need your mind.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,458
Since we can't
ask Okarin anymore,

64
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,375
you're our only hope.

65
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,791
[MAHO]
Don't assume I can do anything

66
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:39,000
because I'm a scientist.
That's fallacious.

67
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:42,083
Makise Kurisu did it before.

68
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:46,500
You had a veritable genius
working on it.

69
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,583
[Daru] Yeah, but... I think
you're as much of a genius

70
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,833
in your own right,
Mini Maho.

71
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,875
[MAHO growls]

72
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,958
Spare me the flattery, please.

73
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,291
Look, I've got
my own work to do.

74
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,041
I take it the answer
is no, then?

75
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
[MAHO]
I'm hanging up now.

76
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,708
[Maho] Salieri couldn't compose
the symphonies Mozart did.

77
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,250
[MAHO]
Hmm?

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,458
[gasps]

79
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,916
--[MAHO screams]
--[MAN gasps]

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
No way.

81
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,500
I let them see me
in this state?!

82
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,666
[whimpers]

83
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,916
[DARU]
For real.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,916
I feel kinda bad about this.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,083
If Okarin found out,
he'd flip his lid.

86
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,833
[SUZUHA] You wanna ask him
for permission?

87
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,291
[DARU]
He'd say no!

88
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,875
As soon as he hears
what we're up to,

89
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,125
then it's all over.

90
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,625
[SUZUHA]
Exactly.

91
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,750
[DARU]
But you know,

92
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,250
Okarin always seems dead serious
when he talks about it.

93
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,500
He says to not even think
about changing the future.

94
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,583
And knowing him,

95
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,083
I'm sure he's got
a damn good reason

96
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,333
for not wanting that.

97
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,708
I get it.

98
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,416
Of all people, I understand
where he's coming from.

99
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,541
But still, is what
he fears worse

100
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:04,541
than letting this timeline
lead the planet

101
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,916
into World War Three?

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,083
I doubt it. Can't be.

103
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,833
[DARU] And he would probably
agree with you

104
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,541
at the end of the day.

105
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,708
[SUZUHA scoffs]

106
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:13,875
If that's true,

107
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,375
then why won't
he take action?

108
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,125
He's got everything he needs!

109
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:20,208
The time machine that
could get him to Steins Gate,

110
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,000
and he still has
the ability to remember

111
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,375
all those other world lines
by Reading Steiner.

112
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,291
So why has he given up on it?

113
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,333
Why won't he at least
try to change things?

114
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,625
Tell me!

115
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:35,208
[DARU] I don't think
he's given up completely.

116
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:38,291
Someday, Hououin Kyouma
will rise again

117
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:42,041
and go "mwaahahahaha"
like before.

118
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:44,250
[SUZUHA] You've been saying
that for so long.

119
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,333
It's been six months.

120
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,166
[DARU]
Well, yeah, but still.

121
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,916
[SUZUHA] We can't count
on Uncle Okarin anymore.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,291
It's time to take matters
into our own hands.

123
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,833
[DARU]
Sorry.

124
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,000
I said you could count on me
and look where that landed us.

125
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,958
No.

126
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,833
Trust that I've noticed how hard
you've been pushing yourself,

127
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,291
and all for my sake.

128
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,000
[phone vibrates]

129
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,375
Got a text from Mayushii.

130

[gasps]

131
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,916
Something wrong?

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
[DARU]
It's Fubuki.

133
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,500
She's back in the hospital!

134
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:20,541

135
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,041
[DARU] Okay.
I'm gonna check this out.

136
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,208
[SUZUHA]
You'll probably see Mom there.

137
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,666
Good luck with that.

138
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,083
[DARU] You really think
I should be hitting on her now?

139
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,250
Sorry.

140
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,708
Sometimes I just get
a little freaked out

141
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,750
that I won't ever be conceived.

142
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,916
[DARU] Right! I solemnly swear
I won't let you down!

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,083
[SUZUHA]
Thanks, Dad. See you later.

144
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:41,958
[DARU]
Yes, ma'am!

145
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,875
I vow to do my best!

146
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,041
[sighs]

147
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,166
[SUZUHA]
Hmm?

148
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,000
What's that?

149
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,375
[footsteps]

150
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,375
[MAYURI gasps]

151
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,916
Uh?

152
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,208
Mayushii. Okarin came too.

153
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,791
Hey, Fubuki!
I'm so sorry you're here!

154
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,250
--Well, uh, see...
--[MAYURI, OKABE] Hmm?

155
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,875
I'm actually fine.

156
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,750
Funny story, though.

157
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,916
[FUBUKI] They just asked me
to check in to the hospital

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,958
so they could run
a few more tests.

159
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,833
But then Kaede here panicked.

160
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,166
Well, Fubuki said she
was gonna be hospitalized

161
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,333
for a little while,
and I got nervous.

162
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,208
I said, "for a little while,"
didn't I? Come on.

163
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,500
So, you're healthy.

164
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:30,916
There's no cause for concern.

165

355
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,750
[DARU panting]

356
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,666
What happened?

357
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,416
That was Kagari,
but different.

358
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,416
Yeah.

359
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,250
Why would she
ever act that way?

360
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,875
[DARU]
Suzuha, did you notice?

361
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,416
[DARU] I'm pretty sure
Kagari was crying.

362
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,833
[gasping]

363
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,750
[SUZUHA]
Ow!

364
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,708
Oh, crap, I'm sorry.

365
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,208
Are you sure we shouldn't
take you to the hospital?

366
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,291
I'm fine.

367
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,458
Just a scratch, I'll make it.

368
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,333
[DARU] So, the woman
in the motorcycle suit

369
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,875
was Kagari all along.

370
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,291
It wasn't.

371
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,125
The person who
attacked you guys,

372
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,416
that was someone else.

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,541
At the time of the incident,

374
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,291
Kagari was still
at the shrine.

375
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:19,833
[DARU]
Then, who?

376
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,166
Not sure,

377
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,916
but I am willing to bet
that Uncle Okarin's theory

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,541
was right in the end.

379
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,541
Kagari actually
was brainwashed,

380
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,958
and whoever did it
is still controlling her now.

381
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:32,208
But who'd do that? And why?

382
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:34,083
Twelve years ago,

383
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,666
someone dangerous
must've found out

384
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,583
that she came here
in a time machine,

385
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,708
and so, they captured her.

386
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,583
[gasps]

387
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,125
What's the matter?

388
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,625
[KAGARI]
He talks to me.

389
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,458
I hear the voice of God.

390
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:50,708
[KAGARI]
I hear... a voice...

391
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,958
The "voice of God."

392
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,708
--But who--?
--Huh?

393
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,791
It can't be!

394
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,000
Does that mean
that when we left,

395
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,291
she was already...?

396
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,416
Hold on.

397
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:02,125
I just think I should
let Okarin know.

398
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,250
He'd want me to tell him
Kagari showed up.

399
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, but think about it.

400
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:08,750
If he hears
that Kagari is back,

401
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,125
he might become obsessed
with trying to find her again,

402
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,625
and that won't help us.

403
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:15,500
I mean, consider
what you just witnessed.

404
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,083
Kagari is dangerous.

405
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,708
She's unstable.

406
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,958
And besides,
if Kagari was brainwashed,

407
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,416
I think I know a way
we can undo the damage.

408
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,125
We can get her back.

409
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,666
Although, in order
to save her,

410
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,250
as dangerous
as it would be,

411
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,750
we'll probably have to use
the time machine.

412
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,583
[SUZUHA]
I am such an idiot!

413
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,916
Why did it take me
so long to remember?

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,041
That bastard tormented
my Valkyrie comrades

415
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,750
one after the other.

416
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,791
The man from the Bureau...

417
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,291
The professor!

418
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,708
Suzuha...

419
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,083
[sighs]

420
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,083
[SUZUHA]
What, Dad?

421
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,583
[DARU] I'm gonna reach out
to Maho again.

422
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:01,833
Huh?

423
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,416
[DARU] I want to ask her
to come back to Japan

424
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,708
and get serious
about developing

425
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:05,875
the time leap machine with me,

426
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,625
to save Kagari
once and for all.

427
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,083
[gasps]

428
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,291
[DARU]
Don't you worry.

429
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,791
I'll do whatever
it takes to finish it,

430
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,666
no matter the cost.

431
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,208
[chuckles softly]

432
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,250
[birds chirping]

433
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,708
[MAHO]
To Japan?

434
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,416
We're lost without
your intelligence.

435
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,666
We need you!

436
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,458
Come help us save the world.

437
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,833
Plus, it would
give me the chance

438
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,833
to see my Mini Maho
in summer clothes, whoo!

439
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,458
Will you wear
a pure white one-piece

440
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,625
and thigh-high socks for me?

441
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,708
--[SUZUHA] Shut up!
--[DARU groans]

442
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
[DARU] Sorry,
my overactive imagination

443
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,333
ran away with me again.

444
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,375
But seriously, Maho, come back.

445
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,000
I need to you
to help me figure it out.

446
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,666
'Cause without you, I'll never
restore the Phone Wave.

447
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,791
You really intend
to fix that thing?

448
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,041
[SUZUHA]
I'll say it again.

449
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,791
We need you here, desperately.

450
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,458
[MAHO]
I get it.

451
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:02,375
Will you at least
let me think this over?

452
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,458
[MAHO] I never pried
into the exact details,

453
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,916
but it's clear.

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,250
Makise Kurisu
and Okabe Rintaro

455
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,041
must have gone through
extensive trial and error

456
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,791
in some other world line.

457
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,333
And, somehow,

458
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,333
they successfully
manipulated time.

459
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,291
She was able to do it.

460
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,791
Makise Kurisu
built a time machine.

461
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,333
[ALEXIS]
I can't believe this.

462
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:31,875
Getting a paper published
at your age is unheard of!

463
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,041
Your talent is the real deal.

464
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,666
And now that the world
has taken notice,

465
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,416
I imagine we're going to get
a lot busier around here!

466
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,875
--[chattering]
--[applause]

467
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,791
[MAHO]
I wanted to crack it.

468
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,041
To prove that I could see
what it held.

469
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,791
I needed to know
that I... could.

470
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,375
[OKABE]
But if you make one wrong move,

471
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,875
you could disgrace that legacy.

472
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,833
You'd be trampling
her memory.

473
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,541
[MAHO]
I'm at a loss.

474
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,500
Should I really
go back to Japan?

475
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,625
[AMADEUS]
Is everything all right, ma'am?

476
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,333
You seem so pensive today.

477
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,083
If you need to talk,
I'd be happy to lend an ear.

478
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,083
That's kind of you.

479
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,833
[gasps]

480
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,083
What's wrong?

481
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,333
[gasps]

482
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,083
[laughs]

483
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,625
[MAHO] Kurisu!
Help me find something!

484
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:35,625
It's an old magazine!

485
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,750
What? Uh. Sure!

486
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,125
[MAHO]
And also...

487
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,750
[MAHO] I can find the solutions
to this problem myself.

488
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,083
Not by scouring your work
to search out the answers,

489
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:51,291
but by following
a similar path,

490
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,958
and finding my own
way to success.

491
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,125
[MAHO] And so,
I will go back to Japan.

492
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,541
To the city where my friend,
Makise Kurisu, lost her life.

493
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,333
My exact reasons are hard
to put into words,

494
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,250
but... but I think,

495
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,958
if I had to explain the impetus,

496
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,250
there was one person
who appreciated Mozart's talent


497
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,500
more than anyone else.

498
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,750
And that was Salieri.
