That's why you've got
to go back, Okabe!

It's a dream
and you have to wake up!

Well, I'll be damned, buddy!

17
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,333
You had us all freaking out

18
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,708
when you just collapsed
for no reason like that.

19
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,458
I collapsed?

20
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,875
Really?

21
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,875
[OKABE] You mean,
Fubuki and I both collapsed?

00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,000
-[MAYURI] Yeah.
-And to make matters even worse,

23
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:40,625
most of the hospitals
were shut down for the New Year.

24
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,875
[OKABE]
Huh, that is odd.

25
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,041
Did it work?

26
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,833
Am I back in
the original world line?

Yep. I do.

00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,916
That's the AI person you have
inside your phone, isn't it?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,791
Amadeus, or something.

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,083
[OKABE] I wish
she wouldn't scare me like that.

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,875
Speaking of, how is Amadeus?

38
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,333
It wasn't completely hacked.

39
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,125
They're restoring it right now.

40
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,833
--Thing is...
--What else happened?

41
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,416
We also found out that a burglar
broke into Maho's hotel room.

42
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,083
And that's not everything.

43
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,916
There was an explosion
at the Wako City office.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,708
They're not letting us in.

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,458
[OKABE]
What strange timing.

46
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,041
Makes me think someone
was orchestrating all of this.

47
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,791
Any clue who did it?

48
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,166
Not at all.

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,041
[OKABE] The attackers
from before, perhaps.

50
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,250
[KAEDE gasps]
Oh, wow, you're awake!

51
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,416
[MAYURI]
Has your fever come down?

52
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
[FUBUKI]
Mm-hmm. It's all gone now.

53
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,875
So, you're feeling better,
too, then, Okarin?

54
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,333
[OKABE]
Uh, yeah.

55
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,833
The doctors have been saying
that I might have

56
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,708
that new form of encephalitis
that's been going around.

57
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,708
But it's probably nothing
to worry too much about.

58
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,375
New encephalitis?

59
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,458
Yeah, it's something
that just popped up.

60
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
It gives people
a pretty high fever.

61
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,541
But still, why would you two
lose consciousness

62
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,416
at the exact same time?

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,458
Without some sort
of external stimulus,

64
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,375
the likelihood of that
is almost zero.

65
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,708
[KAEDE]
See? It has to be what I said!

66
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,000
Will you just drop it?!

67
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,166
What? What?!

68
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,958
Kaede's writing
a romance novel.

69
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,791
She thinks this means
Okabe and I must be soulmates.

70
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:24,791
Huh?

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,541
It's true, Fubuki!

72
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,708
When you first woke up,

73
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,791
all you wanted
to talk about was Okarin.

74
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,750
I told you that was just because
of the weird dream I had!

75
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,208
What dream?

76
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,916
It was so vivid and realistic.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,416
But, Mayushii had been...

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,416
Huh?

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,541
Don't worry!

80
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,083
It was just a nightmare.
Not real at all.

81
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:46,125
But in it,
Mayushii was gone,

82
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,125
and I was working in the
May Queen café with Faris.

83
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:53,250
And then, Okarin came in,
and I had never met him.

84
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,958
[OKABE] She has memories
from the alpha world line.

85
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,500
Could it be
Reading Steiner?

86
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,250
[DOCTOR] Mmm, well,
your symptoms have all gone away

87
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,750
so that's great.

88
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's schedule a follow-up
just to be safe.

89
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,625
I'd like to see you in a week.

90
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,166
--Sound good?
--Uh, sure.

91
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,833
[MAYURI]
I'm glad they let you leave,

92
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,291
aren't you, Okarin?

93
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,875
Fubuki has to stay
in the hospital

94
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,750
a little longer, though.

95
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:16,958
Don't worry!

96
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,208
She's a fighter,
she's gonna be all right!

97
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,666
[KAEDE]
You think?

98
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,666
Hey, Okabe?

99
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,916
Huh?

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,416
Why'd you bring up
Kurisu back there?

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,708
Oh, um, it's just that--

102
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,250
I had a strange dream
about her.

103
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,041
You did?

104
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,166
Hey, where did Hashida go?

105
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,875
Oh, Daru had to leave.

106
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,708
He told me he needed to take
care of something important.

107
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,500
[KAEDE]
Hmm?

108
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,250
[SUZUHA]
So, what else?

109
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,416
Meh.

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,125
Okarin wasn't showing
symptoms anymore,

111
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,000
so the doctors
let him go home today.

112
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,666
Fubuki and Okabe were
both present for the attack.

113
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,875
They collapsed
at the same time?

114
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:57,083
What was he like
when he regained consciousness?

115
00:05:57,166 --> 00:06:00,375
Like the same brooding mess
he's been for a while now.

116
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,833
But he did say a name.

117
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,500
He mentioned Makise.

118
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,166
Makise?

119
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,500
[sighs]

120
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,791
See you guys!

121
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,541
[MAYURI] Yeah!
I'll text you in a little bit!

122
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,000
[MAYURI]
Here you go.

123
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,458
[MAHO]
Oh, thank you.

124
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,000
Now that I think about it,

125
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,458
what with the break-in
at my hotel

126
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,625
and the explosion
at the office,

127
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,041
I don't think I've eaten
anything since last night.

128
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,791
All we have here
is chicken tenders

129
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,291
and some bananas.

130
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,583
Oh, you want me
to go buy you a bento?

131
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,916
That's all right.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,916
I'll eat something
later at the hotel.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,541
You're going back?

134
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,791
[giggles]

135
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,958
The professor asked me
the same thing.

136
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,416
He said I should probably
move to a different one now.

137
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,791
He's right.
You'd be safer that way.

138
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,583
But I don't have any idea
where to stay.

139
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,333
With us?

140
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,125
[MAHO] I wouldn't
want to impose like that.

141
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,000
It's also worth considering
the attack happened here.

142
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,708
--It's no safer.
--[phone buzzing]

143
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,958
No news on the Wako attack.

--[MOEKA] Right.
--Huh?

[OKABE]
Eh... Ah!

146
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,333
Wh-Where did you
even come from?!

147
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,375
[BOTH]
Huh?

148
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,500
Is this a friend
of yours, Okarin?

149
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,333
[OKABE]
Uh, yeah.

150
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,625
--When did you--
--[text notification]

151
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,166
[OKABE] You've
been here this whole time?

152
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,625
I have.

[dishes rattle]

154
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,916
What's going on?

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,041
Why aren't you two talking?

156
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,791
[OKABE]
I know.

157
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,000
[MAHO]
Hmm?

158
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,916
--[door clicks]
--Coffee? What?

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,208
[door clicks]

160
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,291
Your guest left?

161
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,833
But she just got here,

162
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,625
and I was about
to offer her some coffee.

163
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,375
[OKABE] I'm back
in the right world line now.

164
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,125
[OKABE]
And I swear,

165
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,875
I will save it.

166
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,958
I vow to protect this world
where Mayuri gets to live,

167
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,208
and I will not resort
to time travel.

168
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,208
[OKABE] 'Cause I know this
is what Kurisu would want.

169
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,291
[OKABE]
It's the only choice.

170
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,500
[OKABE]
Hiyajo.

171
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:25,666
Huh?

172
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,875
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,083
on finding another hotel?

174
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,583
I'm nursing an idea.

175
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,708
[FARIS] Meow, so that's why
you came to visit me?

176
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,958
[OKABE]
Yeah.

177
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,541
We think your flat
might be the safest place

for Maho to stay
for the time being.

179
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,291
This isn't fair!

180
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
I'm so sorry
to put you on the spot.

181
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,791
That's nice of you,
but it doesn't bother me, meow!

182
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,416
--Uh...
--I knew it!

183
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,166
Didn't I tell you?

184
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,791
I had no doubt Faris would be
willing to let you stay!

185
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,833
[FARIS] You can make yourself
at home in the guest room!

186
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,333
Stay forever!

187
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,416
I want you to live with me
for as long as you're in Japan.

188
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,750
Okay, Maho-meow?

189
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,250
--[giggles]
--[MAHO] "Maho-meow"?

190
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:02,541
[FARIS] We've got Kuroki here
to protect us, he's great!

191
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,208
--So we're super safe, meow!
--[MAHO] Kuroki...?

192
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,875
[FARIS] Wanna take a bath?
Or watch TV?

193
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,000
[MAHO]
Hold on, wait!

194
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,791
Now we can all rest easy!

195
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,083
Well, that depends.

196
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,291
Kagari is still
with Rukako, right?

197
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,333
Mmm. I just heard from them
a little while ago.

198
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,916
Ruka is committed to
making sure Kagari stays inside

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,458
and said not to worry.

200
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,458
[OKABE] I suppose
I've done all I can for now.

201
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,791
Next, I've got to figure out
who raided the lab,

202
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,291
and what they're really after.

203
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,166
--[phone buzzes]
--Huh?

204
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,458
Suzuha?

205
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,416
Suzuha?

206
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,666
[SUZUHA]
I'm over here.

207
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,791
[SUZUHA] Sorry to make you
come all the way to the roof,

208
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,541
but it was necessary.

209
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,500
So, what's this about?

210
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,291
[SUZUHA]
Look, I'm terrible at this.

211
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:03,291
Verbal communication's
not my strong suit.

212
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:04,708
Forgive me if
I skip the niceties

213
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,250
and get straight to the point.

214
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,541
No complaints here.

215
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
Did you experience
a recent world line change?

216
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,291
[OKABE]
What would make you ask me that?

217
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,041
[SUZUHA]
The nature of the situation.

218
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,500
In addition to what
you've told me before

219
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,166
about Reading Steiner
and whatnot.

220
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,875
[OKABE]
What happens if I say yes?

221
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,916
[gasps]

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,541
You may not
understand this,

223
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,250
but it means
a great deal to me.

224
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,000
Suzuha...

225
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,208
Now, then.

226
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:39,333
I order you to tell me,
Okabe Rintaro!

227
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
I'll ask you one more time.

228
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,750
Have you experienced
a world line change?

229
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,166
Is this a different world line
than the one we were in before?

230
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,083
[OKABE]
Don't worry. Everything's okay--

231
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,458
we're still in
the same world line.

232
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,666
[SUZUHA]
Is that the truth?

233
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,250
[OKABE]
Yes.

234
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,541
We shifted to a different one
for a bit, but now we're back.

235
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,500
At least, as far as I can tell.

236
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,833
So you're admitting
that something did shift.

237
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,833
[OKABE] Yes, but I have
no idea what caused it.

238
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,250
The earthquakes in Russia.

239
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
Huh?

240
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,791
[SUZUHA] Those have nothing
to do with nuclear testing.

241
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,333
They're the result
of America and Russia

242
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,375
racing to invent time machines.

243
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,000
Sooner or later,
that competition is going

244
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,250
to spark the beginning
of World War III.

245
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,500
Maybe sooner than we think.

246
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,625
[OKABE]
Russia... and America?

247
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,708
The way he said it
was so distinct.

248
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,625
It's phonetic code.

249
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,416
What is phonetic code?

250
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,125
Used in the military.

251
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,958
Mostly in the western world.

252
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,875
[OKABE]
Is that what happened?

253
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,291
The earthquake?

254
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,000
I am such an idiot.

255
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,958
I was so concerned
about what to do,

256
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,083
but I never had
the time for all that!

257
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,333
[OKABE] Well,
what are you gonna do?

258
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,541
[SUZUHA]
I'm going back to July 28th,

259
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:57,125
and you're coming with me!

260
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,666
And if I won't?

261
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,041
[SUZUHA]
I won't give you that choice.

262
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,875
They're experimenting
with time machines as we speak!

263
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,875
What if the world line
keeps changing because of that,

264
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,291
and the path to reach
Steins Gate

265
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,500
gets blocked off forever?

266
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,750
[OKABE]
What if it's already too late?

267
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:12,750
[SUZUHA gasps]

268
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,083
Could you decide?

269
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,041
Could you make the choice
between two world lines

270
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,125
and know you'd done no harm?

271
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you willing
to kill this world line?

272
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:21,583
To just let it dissolve
into the ether?

273
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:22,916
Shut up, now!

274
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:25,583
[OKABE gasps]

275
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,791
[OKABE gasping]

276
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,416
You shot me...

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
I won't miss again.

278
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,916
[OKABE gasps]

279
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,125
[SUZUHA]
I am begging you.

280
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,583
[OKABE sighs]

281
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,458
July of 2010.

282
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,875
I realized that just by
using the Phone Wave,

283
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,041
I was able to send
messages into the past.

284
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,125
But in the end, the only thing
those d-mails achieved

285
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,750
was changing the world line,
and to restore the original one,

286
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,000
I convinced my friends
to destroy the only world

287
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,083
where they ever
felt safe and happy.

288
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,333
I ripped apart something
we'd crafted,

289
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,708
and I sacrificed more
than you could ever imagine,

290
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:19,208
just to bring this world
back to its rightful state.

291
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
And now, if I go back
to that summer,

292
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,375
the entire hellish nightmare
just replays itself!

293
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,583
[SUZUHA]
So you're content

294
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,333
to just let this world line
be what it is?

295
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,916
World War III is going
to burn the planet,

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,958
and billions of people will die!

297
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,208
There's no escaping it.

298
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,666
That's the way this world line
inevitably ends!

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,833
[OKABE] And what happens
if going back

300
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,541
only makes the situation worse?

301
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:41,958
No, that's not--

302
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,083
[OKABE] What if we're able
to change the world line,

303
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,416
but all that awaits us
is a future

304
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,125
even more
desolate and terrifying

305
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,750
than the one you came from?

306
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,375
[SUZUHA whimpers]

307
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,791
Even if we can change
the events of the past,

308
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:56,500
we can't manipulate the future
to be what we want.

309

312
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,708
Gotta say,
I kinda figured

313
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,125
something like this
might go down.

314
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,791
What are you doing
with that gun?

315
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,541
[growls] You shouldn't have
to ask that, Dad.

316
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,416
We don't have
any time to waste!

317
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,333
We are on the precipice
of an all-out world war!

Okarin to come with you,

319
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,291
how could you be sure
it would solve anything?

320
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,958
[SUZUHA]
I don't know!

321
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,250
[DARU] From the moment I
started researching time travel,

322
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,250
one problem kept
coming back to me over and over.

323
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,250
Trying to control
the outcome of world lines

324
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,708
and manipulate
the law of causality

325
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,000
is too much for any of us.

326
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,333
[SUZUHA]
Then, what can we do?

327
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,375
Why do you think I'm doing
all this in-depth research, kid?

328
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,500
[SUZUHA whimpers]
Dad, I can't--

329
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,958
How about you just trust what
your dear old dad has to say

330
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,541
and behave accordingly,
for once in your life.

331

[SUZUHA gasps]

332
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,250
Just leave it all to me.

333
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,416
I'll figure something
out eventually.

334
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,666
Because, after all,

335
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,125
I am a super hacker!
