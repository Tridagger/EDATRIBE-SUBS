I fared poorly in
the gift exchange.

[AMADEUS] Why don't you
give it to Maho then?

57

Tell her to wear it for you.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,083
Sexual harassment? No thanks.

59
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,416
Ohh, I don't know.
I think she might enjoy it.

00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,958
So you're not... mad at me?

62
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,333
[OKABE] For hanging up
on you on the roof.

63
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,666
You were still talking.

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,041
[AMADEUS]
Sure.

65
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,583
But you called me back
immediately and apologized.

66
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,041
Don't you remember?

67
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,291
[OKABE]
I called her right back?

68
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,583
Why do I have no
recollection of that?

69
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,791
Sorry we kept you waiting.

70
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,375
[ALEXIS]
We were on a call from America

71
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,041
and the connection was awful.

72
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,666
I think they had a weak signal.

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,541
It took much longer
than expected.

74
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,375
Maho and I are both very sorry
for keeping you out so late,

75
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,375
and on Christmas Eve, to boot.

76
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:03,208
Apologies.

77
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,541
No worries.

78
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,541
You took us to a party and we
repay you by making you wait.

79
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,208
[MAHO] Those crayons you got
are adorable, Professor.

What's that, Maho?

81
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,041

I got from Shiina

82
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,916
in the gift exchange.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,916
So, are you going to show us
what you got tonight, Rintaro?

00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,416
Looks like you and Amadeus are
on quite friendly terms already.

90
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,291
Yeah, judging by her tone,
she's sure warmed up to you.

91
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,375
Well, it seems all our
hopes and expectations

92
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,416
might come true after all.
That's great.

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,875

He's being romantic.

95
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,250
The professor has
this weird obsession

96
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,916
with her falling
in love with you.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,541
It's a bit awkward
if you ask me.

98
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,708
Falling in love?

99
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,916
[chuckles] But she's... an AI.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,416
Amadeus is a system that
preserves a person's memories.

101
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
It strives to create
a highly accurate model

102
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,291
of the neural networks.

103
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,500
In other words...

104
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,333
The process and the
framework are the same.

105
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:07,916
[ALEXIS] Amadeus should be able
to love, no question about it.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,166
But Maho thinks that prospect
is "a bit awkward."

107
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,000
[MAHO] Granted, even if we could
prove she was capable of love,

108
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,541
Amadeus could never
be a true partner.

109
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,875
[ALEXIS laughs] Maho, don't
tell me you're getting jealous

110
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,416
of our AI.

111
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,291
[MAHO] You must have gotten
along well in real life.

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,875
Otherwise, this wouldn't
have happened.

113
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,250
She never would have opened up
to you as quickly as she has.

114
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,750
[MAHO]
So, how close were you?

115
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,250
Was she your lover or
something sweet like that?

116
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah, right. Fat chance.

117
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,958
[OKABE]
That's not it.

118
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,791
I met her at the seminar.

119
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,791
[MAHO]
You already told me that much.

120
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,791
Can't be the whole story.

121
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,916
[OKABE grunts]

122
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,500
[MAHO]
Sorry. I just...

123
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,708
[MAHO] I wanted to know
that side of her.

124
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,875
It's a side I never saw.

125
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,208
[OKABE]
Of Kurisu?

126
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:19,791
[MAHO] After all that
time I spent with her,

127
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,791
I feel like I don't know
who she really was.

128
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,625
I don't even know her
favorite books or movies.

129
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,041
I know next to nothing.

130
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,875
Just pieces.

131
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,583
[MAYURI]
Thanks, guys!

132
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,625
I'm glad you all
stayed till the end!

133
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:44,291
[FARIS] Meow! And since we
finished cleaning and stuff,

134
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,291
why don't we head to
May Queen for some tea?

135
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,541

136
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,750
[FUBUKI] But the city is
crawling with hooligans

137
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,083
at this time of night!

138
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,416
[YUKI] Who cares?
We've got strength in numbers.

139
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,916
No one can mess with us!

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,833
[FARIS]
That's right!

141
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:58,250
Yeah, and we've got Ruka!

142
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,750
Sorry, I can't.

143
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,750
There's a guest coming to
stay at our house tonight

144
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,416
and I have to be there to help.

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,708
[FUBUKI]
Oh, seriously?

146
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,125
They're coming over
on Christmas?

147
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:09,041
[RUKA] Yeah. It's some
guest of my father's.

148
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,750
My dad really wants
me to be there.

149
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,583
I wish I could, Mayuri.

150
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,083
[MAYURI]
Mm-mm!

151
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,250
It's been such a long time
since everyone came to the lab.

152
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,625
I had a wonderful night
with you guys!

153
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,000
[KAEDE] Speaking of which,
where did Hashida go?

154
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,750
Oh, Daru told me that he
needed to talk to Suzuha

155
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,333
about something important.

156
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:31,125
[YUKI] Yeah, he did mention
a "family meeting" earlier.

157
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,541
[SUZUHA] She said these
are made of something

158
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,333
I've never heard of
called "wool."

159
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,708
They're a lot warmer
than I thought they'd be.

160
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,583
[SUZUHA]
Don't you like your gift?

161
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,583
Now you can take
Mom out on a date.

162
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,833
[DARU gasps]
On a date?!

163
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,416
Watching you two together
is absolutely terrifying.

164
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,666
You barely even talked
to her at the party.

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
How could I with
you guys watching?

166
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,583
I would need Han Solo
levels of charm

167
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,208
to pull off that kind of feat.

168
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,708
[SUZUHA sighs]

169
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,250
Anyway, you wanted to talk?

170
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,416
You wouldn't pass up
May Queen for nothin'.

171
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,791
There's something that's been
bothering me for a while now.

172
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,208
Suzuha, I want you to
look me in the eyes

173
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,750
and answer this honestly.

174
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,125
What are you up to?

175
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,458
[SUZUHA]
"Up to"?

176
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,041
You haven't been around the lab

177
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,708
or the radio building
very much at all lately.

178
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,166
What have you been doing?

179
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,041
[SUZUHA]
Nothing really.

180
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,333
Whenever you say it's nothing,

181
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,875
that's how I know it's
definitely something.

182
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,333
[DARU]
I promise it's safe with me.

183
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,416
[SUZUHA]
I've been searching for someone.

184
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,583
For who?

185
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,750
[SUZUHA] A girl who traveled
here in the time machine with me

186
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,625
from the future.

187
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,916
[DARU gasps]

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,500
[SUZUHA]
Thing is, we got split up.

189
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,916
It happened here
in Akihabara in 1998.

190
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,583
[OKABE]
She said that?

191
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:56,833
[DARU]
Uh-huh.

192
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,166
[OKABE]
And the girl was 10 years old

193
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,500
when they were separated.

194
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,333
That would make her 22
now if she's still alive.

195
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,083
[DARU] Suzuha keeps saying
she should move on.

196
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
But whenever she's
traveled through time,

197
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,458
she picks up the search again.

198
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,041
[DARU] She was just about to
give up the search for good,

199
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,625
when she stumbled across
this picture on the internet.

200
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,833
She said the girl had been
wearing something like this.

201
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,083
And Suzuha's been searching
for this mystery kid on her own.

202
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,500
What's the girl's name, anyway?

203
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,208
She told you, right?

204
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,333
[DARU]
Mm.

205
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,125
It's Kagari Shiina.

206
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
[gasps] Shiina?

207
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,208
Are you serious?!

208
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:35,125
[DARU]
Mm.

209
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,416
Mayushii's daughter.

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,166
[OKABE]
But--who's the father?

211
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,750
No, no. Stop.

212
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,083
The girl's not her
biological daughter.

213
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,000
She's a war orphan
who Mayushii adopted--

214
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,916
or will adopt in the future.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,333
[sighs]

216
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,208
Huh, quite the development.

217
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,750
[DARU]
According to Suzuha,

218
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,708
in the year 2036, police groups,
called peacekeeping squads,

219
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,791
are after Mayushii and me

220
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,000
for trying to develop
a time machine.

221
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,333
[SUZUHA]
Dad!

222
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,833
[DARU]
Just forget about us!

223
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
The peacekeepers
are closing in.

224
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,166
You have to hurry!

225
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,500
[SUZUHA gasps]

226
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,000
[MAYURI]
Suzuha!

227
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,666
Take Kagari with you.

228
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,208
--[KAGARI crying]
--If that's what you want.

229
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,875
--[KAGARI crying]
--I'll take her.

230
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,500
No! If you're not coming,
I won't go, either, Mommy!

231
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,416
--It's gonna be all right.
--No, I won't!

232
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,875
--I promise you.
--Mommy, please!

233
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,125
[KAGARI cries]

234
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,833
[MAYURI] Suzuha will be
with you the whole time.

235
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,750
I wanna be with you, Mommy!

236
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,250
Mommy! No, please!

237
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,791
[DARU] After that,
Suzuha went back in time.

238
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:39,041
First, she went to 1975,
then 1998, and then 2010.

239
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,833
They got separated
from each other in 1998.

240
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:42,791
[OKABE sighs]

241
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,250
Listen, Okarin.

242
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,833
You think you can help?
We've gotta find this girl.

243
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,666
Look, I know it's a lot
to ask, and you're still--

244
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,166
All right, I'll help.

245
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,500
Seriously?

246
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,041
[OKABE]
World War III rages on.

247
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,125
A child loses her parents,

248
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,166
and Mayuri adopts the war
orphan, in spite of it all.

249
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:08,333
[OKABE] In 25 years,
Mayuri's still kind.

250
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,500
[OKABE]
And then there's that.

251
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,333
What happened to me back there?

252
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,000
[OKABE] If it really was
a world line shift

253
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,458
and not some episode...

254
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,458
...that means someone out
there has created a device

255
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,833
similar to the Phone Wave.

256
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,291
Perhaps...

257
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,625
[ANCHOR 04A] The Japanese
Government has reached out,

258
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,125
but so far, Russia has
not returned Nakabachi,

259
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,583
who defected last Aug--

260
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,958
[AMADEUS]
Did you need something?

261
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:39,375
[OKABE] No, but I am interested
to hear your opinion.

262
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,916
I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,333
[AMADEUS]
Of course not.

264
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:45,666
Conversing with you is
always beneficial for me.

265
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,041
So, what do you need?

266
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,708
[OKABE] How would you go about
locating a missing person

267
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,500
who was last seen 12 years ago?

268
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,875
What method would you use?

269
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,000
[AMADEUS]
Hmm. I need more detail.

270
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:02,416
Uhh, well, I have
no further details.

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,333
[AMADEUS] That makes it
difficult to form an opinion.

272
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,083
The best advice I have
is to go to the police.

273
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,666
Yeah, you're right.

274
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,708
[AMADEUS] Though, judging by
that face, you can't do that.

275
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,458
Check the newspapers or
hire a private investigator.

276
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,708
[OKABE]
In America, sometimes they use

277
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,500
dowsing rods and psychics.

278
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,000
[AMADEUS]
f you wanna be on one of those

279
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,041
true crime TV shows,

280
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,875
I'm sure the
Professor could help.

281
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,625
[OKABE]
I'm just spitballing.

282
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,125
[AMADEUS chuckles]

283
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,000
[OKABE gasps]

284
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,833
[MAHO]
Makise Kurisu was murdered.

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

286
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,166
[AMADEUS]
Huh? Mm.

287
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,875
[KAGARI]
The Y2K problem?

288
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,458
[SUZUHA]
Did you ever study that?

289
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,208
[KAGARI]
At the institution.

290
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,875
[SUZUHA] This knowledge
was never made public,

291
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,500
but the main culprit in that
crisis was this computer,

292
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,000
the IBN 5100.

293
00:14:58,083 --> 00:14:59,875
That's why I'm using
this patch program--

294
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,916
to make sure the
Y2K problem never happens.

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,041
[KAGARI] But... if you
and I are from the future,

296
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,666
is it okay to do that?

297
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,625
Wouldn't it change the time
that we came from, too?

298
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:14,833
[SUZUHA] It's something that we
must do to reach Steins Gate.

299
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,208
I intend to change the future.

300
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,541
Change it on purpose?

301
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,000
[SUZUHA]
That's right.

302
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,916
We can't let a world like
the one we came from exist.

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,416
I'll prevent that.

304
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,458
[KAGARI whimpers]

305
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,208
[KAGARI panting]

306
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,416
[KAGARI]
You can't do that.

307
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,666
[gasps]

308
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,125
[KAGARI] I won't let you
do something like that.

309
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,875
[KAGARI]
I hear a voice.

310
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,208
[SUZUHA]
Kagari!

311
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:07,333
[door opens]

312
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,458
Oh, hey, Suzuha.

313
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:09,750
Find anything?

314
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,208
[DARU] I finished combing
through the police's

315
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:14,083
entire missing
persons database...

316
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,666
...but nothing in it
caught my eye at all.

317
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,833
On the surface,
this world seems so peaceful.

318
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,041
But the number of missing
and unidentified people

319
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,583
says otherwise.

320
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,666
[DARU]
Yeah.

321
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,166
Hey, by the way, Dad,

322
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,958
did you talk to Uncle
Okarin about this?

323
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,291
[DARU]
Mm.

324
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,375
He said he would do
what he could to help us.

325
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:33,875
Well, that's a relief.

326
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,083
I'll tell him thanks
next time I see him.

327
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,250
You should.

328
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,250
Hearing that might
do him a lot of good.

329
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,000
[phone vibrates]

330
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,708
[AMADEUS]
What's this? Ignoring me again?

331
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,250
I was in the library.

332
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
[AMADEUS]
Uh--my bad. Wow!

333
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,166
I have no right to chastise you.

334
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,000
It was wrong. I'm so sorry.

335
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,416
[OKABE chuckles]
It's not that big of a deal.

336
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,166
[AMADEUS] No, I don't
want to think that way.

337
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,666
I hate not admitting
when I screw up,

338
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,416
so I'm practicing.

339
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,291
Why were you in
the library anyway?

340
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,583
Uh, I was perusing back issues

341
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,125
of newspapers from
12 years ago. You know.

342
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,708
[AMADEUS]
Looking for that missing person?

343
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,958
Indeed.

344
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,166
[AMADEUS gasps]

345
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,333
What if I did
supplementary research?

346
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,250
Huh?

347
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,750
You have that ability?

348
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,375
[AMADEUS] Yeah, the base of
Amadeus resides on a server

349
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:22,625
in the research facility at
Viktor Chondria University.

350
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm allowed to use the
computers and network

351
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,000
for whatever I want,
whenever I want.

352
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you need me to scour
the internet for evidence?

353
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,166
'Cause I'm game!

354
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,375
Hang on. Is that within
the AI moral code?

355
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,291
[AMADEUS]
Well...

356
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,791
[OKABE groans]

357
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,458
[AMADEUS] Look, what people
don't know won't hurt them.

358
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:39,750
[sighs]

359
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:40,833
[AMADEUS]
Besides,

360
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,750
you're not doing
anything wrong, are you?

361
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,083
[OKABE]
Of course not.

362
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:45,166
[AMADEUS]
Okay, then!

363
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,625
I leave it up to you,
but I'm down.

364
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,875
Whaddya say?

365
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,750
[OKABE] Let me think it over
and get back to you.

366
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,875
[FARIS] Oh, hey!
I spot a Meowster Kyou--

367
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,125
I mean, look! I spot an Okarin!

368
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,000
[OKABE] Well, well.
This is an interesting pairing.

369
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,583
[FARIS]
Ruka's dad sent us on a quest

370
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
to pick up a couple of
things from the store.

371
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,791
It's because my dad
has a house guest

372
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,416
and it's going to be more
long term than we thought.

373
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,916
We're stocking up.

374
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,125
Oh, yeah?

375
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,958
That looks pretty heavy.
Do you need a hand?

376
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,583
[RUKA gasps]
No.

377
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:20,791
I can manage.

378
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,625
It's lighter than it looks.

379
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:24,708
And I have been
swinging my sword.

380
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,041
[FARIS]
We're on a special mission

381
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,750
that would be a little bit
awkward to ask Kyou--

382
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,791
I mean, Okarin, to help us with.

383
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,166
In times like these, you'd
better just leave it to Faris!

384
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,625
Thanks anyway, though.

385
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:34,958
No worries.

386
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,875
Hey, didn't both of you
grow up around this area?

387
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:39,916
[BOTH]
Huh?

388
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,000
[FARIS]
A girl went missing from here?

389
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,916
I'll have to ask Kuroki
if he remembers that.

390
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,250
[OKABE]
That'd be great.

391
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,000
So this girl went missing
more than a decade ago?

392
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,375
I'll ask my dad if he remembers.

393
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,666
[OKABE]
I'd appreciate it.

394
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,416
Well, we had better
get going meow.

395
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,625
Right.

396
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,541
[FARIS]
Kyouma!

397
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,250
If you ever find
yourself in trouble,

398
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,958
don't sit around
making a sad face!

399
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:06,708
Come see Faris Kitty.
I'll make it all better!

400
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,708
[FARIS giggles]

401
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,250
[phone vibrates]

402
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,375
[OKABE]
I see.

403
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,166
So no leads on your end.

404
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,250
[FARIS]
No, sorry.

405
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,250
Well, thanks for
asking around though.

406
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,250
Oh, but I did hear
stories about a ghost

407
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,750
with her hair in braids.

408
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,166
[OKABE]
A ghost?

409
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,041
It's some sort of urban legend
that pops up around here

410
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,791
every few years.

411
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,333
Especially in the area
near the radio building.

412
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,791
People were getting spooked by
the ghost of a girl in braids

413
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,166
asking if they'd seen
another little girl.

414
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,125
Professor Leskinen?

415
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,125
[SUZUHA] I'm telling you, it's
really okay to stop searching.

416
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,000
Thanks, anyway.

417
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,000
[DARU]
No!

418
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,541
Sure, we don't have any clues,

419
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,291
but don't you think it's
too soon to give up?

420
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,291
[OKABE]
What's going on?

421
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,875
Hey, Okarin.

422
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:09,250
I don't want to burden you guys
any more than I already have.

423
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,250
Kagari was my responsibility.

424
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,875
This is my problem.

425
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,291
Don't be an idiot!

426
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,666
Any problem a child has

427
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,166
is the parents'
problem, too, noob!

428
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,458
Uh--Dad!

429
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,458
Did I do okay?

430
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,333
Did that sound like something
a real dad would tell his spawn?

431
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,583
[sighs]

432
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,083
This is the part where
you jump on me and say,

433
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,541
"I love you, Papa!"

434
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,791
Familial bonds aside,

435
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,208
when you're in trouble,
you call in the experts.

436
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:34,291
If we're looking for someone,

437
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,833
we might as well
bring in a specialist

438
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,375
to help us find her, right?

439
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,166
No, I disagree.

440
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,791
The fewer people involved
in this, the better.

441
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,083
[OKABE sighs]

442
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,333
Did you have someone
in mind, Daru?

443
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,583
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

444
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,666
Don't you dare underestimate me.

445
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,833
I may be a geek,

446
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,125
but I'm more resourceful
than you think.

447
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,208
I'm ahead of the game.
I already contacted somebody.

448
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,166
--[phone beeps]
--Bam!

449
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,750
Speak of the devil.

450
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:02,041
They texted that they could
come right over, if we want.

451
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
Dad, no!

452
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,083
Let's give it a shot.

453
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,375
Okay! They said they're
in the vicinity

454
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,916
so they should be
here in a second.

455
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,500
That was oddly fast.

456
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,916
[DARU]
Better than oddly slow.

457
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,250
[phone vibrates]

458
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,500
Rukako?

459
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:18,500
Hello, there.

460
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,333
[RUKA gasps]
Good, you answered.

461
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,541
Sorry, but do you have
a minute to talk?

462
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,666
[OKABE]
Sure, what's up?

463
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,458
Well, I, um...

464
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,083
Look, I really need to ask your
advice about something, so...

465
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,958
Are you available to meet
in person right now?

466
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,166
[OKABE]
Right this minute?

467
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,416
[RUKA]
Yes.

468
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,458
Uh, someone is on their
way over for a meeting.

469
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,916
Can it wait until tonight?

470
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,125
[RUKA] Unfortunately, it's
urgent, so that won't work.

471
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,291
[knocking]

472
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,291
Uh, sorry, I'll
call you back later.

473
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,333
Yeah, coming! Hold on!

474
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:52,458
[gasps]

475
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,916
[OKABE gasping]

476
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,750
[MOEKA]
I got your message.

477
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,500
[MOEKA]
I'm Moeka. Moeka Kiryu.

478
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,791
Can I come in?
