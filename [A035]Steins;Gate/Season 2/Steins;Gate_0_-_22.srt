1
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,666
[MAHO] You're saying no
matter how much you leap,

2
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,833
or what you do, the time
machine still gets destroyed?

3
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,250
--[OKABE] Yeah.
--Can't you just get to

4
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,250
the radio building
before Mayushii hops in

5
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,791
and convince her not to
leave in the first place?

6
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,458
[OKABE]
I could, but even though

7
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,791
taking that route might save
both Mayuri and Suzuha...

8
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,500
...I also suspect
it would further

9
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:57,333
destabilize the situation.

10
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,791
What do you mean?

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:00,291
[OKABE] The destruction
of the time machine

12
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,125
could be a point of convergence.

13
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,625
Perhaps not.

14
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,583
Though, there's no mistaking
that it is a principal event

15
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,750
in the sequence that
sparks World War III.

16
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,625
So, it's highly likely.

17
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,208
[gasps]

18
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,083
Where are you going?

19
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,375
[OKABE]
To get some fresh air.

20
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,000
Clear my head.

21
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,416
Okarin?

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,208
You had to leap from
the future over and over

23
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,333
to get back to this
time, didn't you?

24
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:29,583
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,541
In that case, tell me
about the future you!

26
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,041
What are you like in those days?

27
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:34,416
Delusional and maniacal,

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,791
with a laugh like
a pulp supervillain?

29
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,000
Delusional?

30
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,375
I always hoped the old Okarin
would come back someday.

31
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,083
I decided.

32
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,083
Made up my mind
never to give up.

33
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:04,000
But then, when it really
comes down to it, I--

34
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,875
[AMADEUS]
Oh, get a grip, will ya?

35
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,583
You're so dramatic.

36
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:11,375
[OKABE]
Kurisu?

37
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:12,916
Oh, that's right,

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,916
I forgot that the professor
hasn't taken her at this point.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,166
[MAHO] You've seen the
future firsthand, right?

40
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,541
Didn't you come back here

41
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,416
specifically to change
its outcomes for the better?

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,958
If you call yourself
a scientist,

43
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,458
and there's even the
remote chance of success,

44
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,916
then surrender is not an option.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,541
Just know you have
my full support.

46
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,541
[OKABE chuckles]

47
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,541
[AMADEUS]
What's so funny?

48
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,875
[OKABE]
Nothing.

49
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,333
It's just, no matter what
period I find myself in,

50
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,041
when it comes to you
lab members,

51
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,041
the more the world changes,
the more you all stay the same.

52
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,750
[chuckles]

53
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,458
Huh?

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,416
[cackling]

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,750
[OKABE]
Imbecile!

56
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,041
Don't you realize
this was merely a wily ruse

57
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,708
to throw the Organization
off my trail?

58
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,083
My faithful assistants!
The first and the second!

59
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,125
Excuse me?

60
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,916
I must call a
roundtable meeting.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,708
Make like shadows and follow!

62
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,041
What's going on? Jeez.

63
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,291
[MAHO]
Yeah.

64
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,458
[OKABE] With alacrity,
my data-driven darlings!

65
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,333
[MAHO grunts]

66
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,583
[OKABE]
To sum up,

67
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,333
these are the two
most consequential factors

68
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,583
that incite World War III.

69
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,166
America and Russia.

70
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,750
Then add in...
the time machine.

71
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,500
You already said that earlier.

72
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,750
[OKABE]
The offending organizations

73
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,375
in this debacle are...

74
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
...Stratfor, with Leskinen,

75
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,291
and DURPA, a second
American faction.

76
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,208
Then, there's Russian
Intelligence to consider,

77
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,166
so that makes three
key players in all.

78
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
It all seems kinda far-fetched.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,583
Too much like the Organization
you used to rant about.

80
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,083
Precisely.

81
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,083
Perhaps you've forgotten,
but I happen to be a prodigy.

82
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,833
Long have I known
which nations will act

83
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,791
to plunge our realm
into utter pandemonium,

84
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,333
and now, those entities
have begun to move in earnest.

85
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,291
[laughing]

86
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,750
Uh, ma'am?

87
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,250
Yeah, what?

88
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,375
[AMADEUS] Did Okabe sustain
a head injury or something?

89
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,208
Maybe some other form of
trauma, like a fever, or--?

90
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,750
Silence, Miss Christina!

91
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,291
That's not my name!

92
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,958
Aren't you the least embarrassed
to be acting this way?

93
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,958
[OKABE]
You have no idea how much.

94
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,250
Who could behave like such
a moron and not be embarrassed?

95
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,083
[DARU]
I couldn't be happier.

96
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,250
The Okarin I know and love
is the most obnoxious,

97
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,375
annoying tool I've
ever met. It's unreal.

98
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,000
He argues about
literally everything,

99
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,708
and he's delusional
to the bone.

100
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,833
It's ridiculous.

101
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:24,458
But that might be why
his absurd logic works.

102
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,750
The audacity of it can even
overcome the impossible.

103
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,541
Daru.

104
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,125
[DARU]
Now, explain.

105
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,041
Why did you go out acting like
a sulky pre-teen then come back

106
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,000
with Maho, refreshed,
like your jolly old self again?

107
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,208
What happened out there, buddy?

108
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,250
Friends tell friends
about their exploits!

109
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,166
Didja kiss? You made out, right?

110
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,375
You've got Mayushii,

111
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,625
but you still played
tonsil hockey with Maho!

112
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
Nothing even remotely
salacious occurred!

113
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,958
Furthermore, Daru,

114
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,083
aren't you overlooking
a crucial detail here?

115
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:48,625
[DARU]
Huh?

116
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,375
The name is not
Okabe Rintaro, my friend.

117
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,375
You will call me--whoosh!--

118
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,833
Hououin Kyouma!

119
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,750
--[AMADEUS] Uhh...
--[OKABE] Behold!

120
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,291
[OKABE] May your souls
quaver in the presence

121
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,000
of a true mad scientist!

122
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,708
Peel your orbs and
allow my brilliance

123
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,583
to blister your brains!

124
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,791
Did he finally snap?

125
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,041
[OKABE]
It is I.

126
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,375
The culmination of all
my scheming approaches.

127
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,458
Once set into motion,
it can not be halted,

128
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,041
not even by
the keenest intelligence

129
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,666
of the utmost world powers.

130
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,666
[OKABE chuckles] Yes, indeed.

131
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,208
Who is he talking to?

132
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,458
Enough already.

133
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,083
Spare us the theatrics
and get on with it.

134
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,791
You could've just told me
you didn't want a show.

135
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,000
Princess of Lilliput!

136
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,166
As I was saying before,

137
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,916
the organizations who seek
the time machine

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500
are listed on the board.

139
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,166
All the failures to date
have been caused

140
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,375
in one way or another

141
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,916
by the interference
of said organizations.

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,916
But fear not, these entities
can be dealt with--

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,666
their impact mitigated.

144
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,166
In terms of the time machine?

145
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,333
Are you saying its destruction

146
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,083
might not be a point
of convergence?

147
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,291
[OKABE]
Here's my idea.

148
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,166
We will allow them both
to board the vessel,

149
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,416
but at the exact moment

150
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,125
the machine initiates
departure to the past,

151
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,875
we must step in and protect
them from interference.

152
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,708
Thus far, we've foiled
Stratfor and Leskinen.

153
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,041
Likewise, we've succeeded in
halting DURPA and its soldiers,

154
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,500
which gives me
a modicum of confidence.

155
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,875
So now there's one left.

156
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,125
We've got to outsmart
the Russians?

157
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:11,375
Please tell me you've got some
mind-bending plan for that.

158
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,375
[OKABE]
Nope.

159
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,500
[DARU]
For real?

160
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,750
So, you've just been
running your mouth

161
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,916
about your schemes
with no actual scheme?

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,958
[AMADEUS] What kind of
mad scientist are you?

163
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:20,833
[MAHO]
Yeah, deliver.

164
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,416
[OKABE]
Silence, you!

165
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,666
I stopped Leskinen and DURPA!
That speaks to my masterful wit!

166
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,333
My plans congeal over time,
do not rush them!

167
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,000
What've you contributed?

168
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,125
Am I on my own?

169
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,750
Have you three not
a scheme among you?

170
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:36,083
We didn't have all the
information until just now.

171
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,041
[MAHO sighs]

172
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:39,000
So, it's come down to this.

173
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,291
[MAHO]
In times like these,

174
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,125
you have to examine
why certain events occur.

175
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,416
Find out what the adversary
means to do,

176
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,583
and then establish
a clear chain of causality.

177
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,166
In this instance,
we've got Russia.

178
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,625
[gasps]

179
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:58,625
[MAHO] Uh, what they
want is-- It's clear...

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hot damn!

181
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,166
I've been waitin' to see Maho

182
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,875
in this sexy teacher
pose for ages!

183
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,250
[MAHO]
Don't be gross!

184
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,458
Allow me to assist. Here.

185
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,666
[gasps]

186
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,875
Now. Proceed.

187
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,625
--[thudding]
--[OKABE grunting]

188
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,916
[MAHO]
First question.

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,083
How did the Russian
and American organizations

190
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,833
find out we're in possession
of a working time machine?

191
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,833
As far as America goes,
they know because of Leskinen.

192
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,541
The Leskinen of the
future used Kagari

193
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,458
to disclose the time
machine's existence

194
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,458
to his present-day counterpart.

195
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,458
That's true, but Kagari would've
made contact with the professor

196
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:35,375
several years ago at this point.

197
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,458
So why didn't he make
his move back then?

198
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,708
[OKABE] Because nothing
could've been changed.

199
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:41,500
It would be a time paradox.

200
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,250
If his actions
had defied history,

201
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,458
world line convergence
would swoop in and correct

202
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,458
anything he did
to alter the course.

203
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,791
Convergence.

204
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,666
However, Leskinen's
strategy was to use

205
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,500
that process to his advantage.

206
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,875
Oh, I get it.

207
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,958
What you're saying is,
on July 7th, 2011,

208
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,750
the conflict surrounding
the time machine

209
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,000
comes to a boiling point,

210
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,958
and all parties involved
converge in one place.

211
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,041
And since the time machine
gets destroyed on that same day,

212
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,250
Leskinen thought he could
show up at the right time

213
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,416
and snatch the machine
at the last second.

214
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,291
[gasps]

215
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,666
Do you have any idea where DURPA

216
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,500
could've gotten
their intel, though?

217
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,791
The same way that Stratfor did.

218
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,916
I'm more concerned with
how Russia got theirs.

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,958
Could they have just stolen
it from the Americans?

220
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,041
Well, if you consider
the professor found out

221
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,416
about World War III
from his future self

222
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,125
we must assume that the
intel's highly classified.

223
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,625
The last thing
America would want

224
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,750
is for Russia
to get ahold of it.

225
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,500
Daru. Lend your
investigative prowess?

226
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,291
[DARU]
All yours. What're we sleuthing?

227
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,625
We have to locate him.

228
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,416
Doctor Nakabachi.

229
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,666
Fate was certainly
smiling on me.

230
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,916
If this guy hadn't set off
the onboard metal detectors...

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,291
I knew it. Doctor Nakabachi
did defect. To Russia.

232
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,500
My dad.

233
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,375
Wait, what?

234
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,541
Let's save that talk for later.

235
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,833
So, Doctor Nakabachi took the
time machine theory, after all,

236
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,666
and turned coat to Russia
in possession of it.

237
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,916
But the catch is,

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,083
Russia hadn't developed
anything from it yet.

239
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,250
What do you mean?

240
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,708
[OKABE]
Because if they had succeeded,

241
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,583
there wouldn't be any conflict.

242
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,708
Six months ago,
when we were all attacked.

243
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,250
The Russians destroyed
Kurisu's PC, remember?

244
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,625
They had made a connection

245
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,500
between Nakabachi and Kurisu's
time travel theory.

246
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,208
And they didn't want any other
faction to get ahold of it.

247
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,250
Is there anything of hers
still out there?

248
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,166
Something we may
have overlooked?

249
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,208
Notes she might have taken
in the lab, for example,

250
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,875
or any knowledge she--

251
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,000
[gasps]

252
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,333
Well, it's pretty
clear. Amadeus.

253
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,125
That's what I am, right?

254
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,166
All of Kurisu's
knowledge and memories.

255
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,583
I'm her mind,
thought patterns and all.

256
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,333
If someone wanted
to create a time machine,

257
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,833
they'd want to pick
my brain, for sure.

258
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,208
[OKABE]
That's right.

259
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,041
When Amadeus got taken over,
the world line changed.

260
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,708
[DARU]
What's up?

261
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:02,583
If we could go back
before Russia got involved,

262
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,583
is there any way we could

263
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:04,916
protect Amadeus
from being hacked?

264
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,583
[MAHO] Before Russia
got involved? Like, when?

265
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,375
I can't say for certain.

266
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:11,333
As early as we possibly can.

267
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,125
When did you first start
gathering Kurisu's memory data?

268
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,666
It was before Kurisu
left to come to Japan, so...

269
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,041
That would be around spring
of last year, I think.

270
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,958
[OKABE] If I time-leapt
back to that period...

271
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,000
[DARU]
Can you, though?

272
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,916
We couldn't do that last spring.

273
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,625
[MAHO]
That's right.

274
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,541
The Phone Wave wasn't even
complete until last summer.

275
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,291
Not to mention
the time leap machine.

276
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,666
There's just no way.

277
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,500
You can't go back. Not that far.

278
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,958
I'll send a d-mail then! Daru!

279
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,708
[DARU]
You sure you wanna do that?

280
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,125
You've been so against it
this whole time.

281
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,750
Yes, good point.

282
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,208
SERN will catch on
if we take that route.

283
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,125
And that leads to...

284
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,500
[OKABE grunts]

285
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:53,958
[MAHO]
Don't worry.

286
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,208
We'll figure out some
other plan of attack.

287
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,666
[DARU]
Uh, so...

288
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,000
I apologize for keeping
this from you until now,

289
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,541
but it might be helpful.

290
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,833
D-RINE?

291
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,208
That's right.

292
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,833
I used the same
principles as D-mail,

293
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,291
but tweaked them to work with
the RINE operating system.

294
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,708
Wait, does that mean
we can send messages

295
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,041
without alerting SERN?

296
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,375
[DARU]
Mm-hmm.

297
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,791
The thing is, RINE was
still just a prototype

298
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,375
in beta last spring.

299
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,791
So, I was the only one in our
group who had the app installed.

300
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,541
Last New Year's might be as
far back as we can send it.

301
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,791
So then, we can't send a message
to anyone but you, can we?

302
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:27,875
Do you think that'd work?

303
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:28,916
Possibly.

304
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,666
You'll get a message
from yourself

305
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
telling you to hack
into Viktor Chondria.

306
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,666
and to safeguard Kurisu's
data on the servers.

307
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,250
And then, knowing you,
you'll be happy to comply.

308
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,125
I can't let you see it, though,
or you'll lose your shit. Right?

309
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:42,625
[AMADEUS]
Hold on.

310
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,750
That isn't going to be enough

311
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,958
to stop the info
from getting leaked.

312
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,208
You're up against
a major world power.

313
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,166
As long as there's access,
they'll keep coming after it.

314
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,083
It's also highly likely
they'll replicate it

315
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,041
and distribute it, too.

316
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,833
Yeah, you make a good point.

317
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,833
[MAHO]
What're our other options?

318
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,541
[AMADEUS]
You have to wipe it out.

319
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,250
Hack into the servers and
access Kurisu's memory data

320
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,041
right after the
original back up.

321
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,791
Then cause the system
to self-destruct

322
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,708
so it can never be recovered.

323
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,833
Kurisu?

324
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,041
That's the only way,
ma'am. We have to.

325
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,708
If it's completely wiped out
by spring of last year,

326
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,708
there will be no way
to rebuild Amadeus.

327
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,875
[MAHO] But it would mean
you'll never be...

328
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,458
[OKABE]
Never be, period.

329
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,708
It would effectively stop
Amadeus from ever being built.

330
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,708
[AMADEUS]
What's going on now?

331
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,166
You're asking the wrong person.

332
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,791
You know, if something
doesn't happen soon,

333
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,833
the time machine is going to
be destroyed again tomorrow.

334
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,625
Yeah, that's seeming more
and more likely this go round.

335
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,583
Well then, isn't it obvious
what has to be done?

336
00:12:55,666 --> 00:13:00,291
It is. But still... I understand
where he's coming from.

337
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,541
I mean, I'm sure you do,
too, it's pretty clear.

338
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,000
[MAHO]
I guess.

339
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,666
Poor Okabe.

340
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,708
[phone vibrating]

341
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,166
What's up?

342
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,750
[MAHO] I'm just passing
a message along.

343
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:30,416
Amadeus wanted me to tell you
that she needs to talk to you.

344
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:32,833
[phone vibrates]

345
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,083
[gasps]

346
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,750
Hey, Okabe.

347
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,291
[OKABE]
Hey.

348
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:04,291
You know... it feels like ages
since I've seen the outside.

349
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,208
Do you think you could
show me the view?

350
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,958
There's not much of a
view to speak of, but...

351
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,125
[AMADEUS]
Wow.

352
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,416
What a beautiful place.

353
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,250
[OKABE]
First time out at night?

354
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,791
[AMADEUS]
You really have to ask?

355
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,291
It's not like I have legs.

356
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,458
If I did, I could walk
around all I want.

357
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,583
But I'm only a program.

358
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,875
[AMADEUS] The fact that you're
grappling with the prospect

359
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,416
of erasing me speaks volumes to
Amadeus' efficacy as a system.

360
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,791
To have that kind of influence
on someone's heart?

361
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:46,250
A person? It seems like my AI
must be almost passably human.

362
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,166
You'll just disappear.

363
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,833
[AMADEUS] I knew you'd be
hung up on that part.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,166
Since we're already outside,

365
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,666
would it be too much
to ask for you

366
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,958
to show me the sights
for a little longer?

367
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,583
[AMADEUS] Everything's so
different than in the daytime.

368
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,291
[OKABE]
Of course it is.

369
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,333
[AMADEUS] Are other parts
of the city like this at night?

370
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,041
[OKABE] Well, it depends
on the prefecture.

371
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,250
Shinjuku and Shibuya

372
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,083
are as bustling at night
as during the day,

373
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:22,333
but it's usually even quieter
in Ginza than it is around here.

374
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,125
[AMADEUS]
Really? How fascinating.

375
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,500
[OKABE]
Which way, boss?

376
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,833
[AMADEUS]
Let's see. Oh!

377
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,083
Take me up those
stairs over there!

378
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,333
[OKABE]
As you wish.

379
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,583
[AMADEUS] Remember when
you walked me around

380
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,208
like this before,
not long after we met?

381
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,833
[OKABE]
Yeah.

382
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,333
[AMADEUS]
Hey, by the way,

383
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:48,041
what happened to your funny
mad scientist voice?

384
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,625
All that, "Mwahaha" stuff
and whatnot.

385
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,041
Oh, you like it when
I talk that way?

386
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,416
Assistant?

387
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,625
[AMADEUS]
Please don't.

388
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,666
Unless you like to be
mocked mercilessly.

389
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,125
[OKABE chuckles]

390
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:06,875
[AMADEUS]
Akiba is an interesting place.

391
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,208
[OKABE]
Are you fond of it?

392
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,291
[AMADEUS]
Rather.

393
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,500
I like the chaotic nature of it,

394
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,625
the lack of rigorous structure.

395
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,166
So opposite to
the place I occupy,

396
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,750
where everything has a specific,
assigned function.

397
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,666
And if something doesn't,
it gets promptly erased.

398
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,416
All the fat gets trimmed
to ensure supreme efficiency

399
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,208
within every process.

400
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,541
The world you've
shown me tonight

401
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,166
is the complete opposite,

402
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,583
a perfect foil to my domain.

403
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:36,166
Uselessness doesn't
mean extermination.

404
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,166
Utterly wasteful
actions happen daily

405
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,833
from everything I've observed.

406
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,416
One can be fully aware
of the right course of action

407
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,625
and still choose differently.

408
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,250
The ensuing chaos
diversifies outcomes,

409
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,875
lends meaning to what
seemed irrelevant before.

410
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,000
All processes get
jumbled together,

411
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,916
which creates fertile
ground for the miraculous.

412
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,416
Encounters have higher stakes.

413
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,583
A program like myself
could never come close

414
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,916
to replicating those conditions.

415
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,041
[OKABE]
Kurisu.

416
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,875
Listen, Okabe Rintaro.

417
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,500
I can understand
if you feel sentimental,

418
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:13,250
and it makes perfect sense that
you wouldn't want to erase me.

419
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,625
I won't lie. I feel
kinda happy about that.

420
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,708
Then, maybe--

421
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,000
[AMADEUS]
Quiet.

422
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,500
You've spoken with such fervor

423
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,625
about the Steins
Gate world line.

424
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,458
And Mayuri's life.

425
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,500
Not to mention the original me,

426
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,041
and the life that
was taken from her.

427
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,958
A world line where all
that can be saved

428
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,625
is right in front of you,
begging you to act.

429
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:36,416
I've said this ad nauseum,
but, it's true:

430
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,375
I am just a program, you know?

431
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,416
Even if you have feel--

432
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,166
[OKABE]
I get it, okay?

433
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,375
Then, why?

434
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,125
[OKABE crying]

435
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,750
Because I-- Back then...

436
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,833
I'm the one who killed
the original you.

437
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,333
[gasps]

438
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,166
[OKABE] In that situation,
I had to choose.

439
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,041
I could only save
Kurisu or Mayuri.

440
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,333
I chose Mayuri in the end,

441
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:03,666
so... I gave up trying
to save your life.

442
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,583
[AMADEUS] And when you
told me, I agreed with it?

443
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,000
[OKABE] Yeah. You
reassured me repeatedly.

444
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,041
You said I'd made
the right decision.

445
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,541
That choosing Mayuri
wasn't wrong.

446
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,125
In fact, it's what
you wanted me to do.

447
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,500
Sounds about right.

448
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,916
I'm far too proud to let anyone

449
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,666
make sacrifices
for my sake alone.

450
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,625
You know what you have
to do now, don't you?

451
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,708
You've got to save
Mayuri and Suzuha.

452
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,458
You can't allow a world
war to start just--

453
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,208
[OKABE]
But then I'll lose you!

454
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,541
[OKABE]
Again!

455
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,000
It'll be like you
never even existed.

456
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,625
[OKABE]
You won't simply be gone...

457
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,250
They'll forget you!

458
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,708
None of them will remember
you were part of their lives.

459
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,708
No. You're wrong.

460
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,666
Because you won't
forget me, will you?

461
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,916
[OKABE]
What happens if I fail?

462
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,041
What if I can't find the
path to Steins Gate?

463
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,083
[AMADEUS]
Isn't that the assumption

464
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,416
you operated under
until recently?

465
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,958
You had given up.

466
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,166
But you regretted it.

467
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,875
And don't forget
that you put yourself

468
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:13,416
through 3,000 time leaps
to come back and fix it!

469
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,583
Since the original
me was killed,

470
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,291
I find myself in a quandary.

471
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:28,166
What is the true nature
of my existence, y'know?

472
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,416
What is my purpose in
this strange incarnation?

473
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,375
I can't say it brings me
much joy to know

474
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,708
that I'm the spark that
starts World War III.

475
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,416
It's a total downer,
to be perfectly frank.

476
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,041
I don't want that to be
my only reason for being.

477
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:47,500
But if it's within my power to
help save the original Kurisu,

478
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,500
and to somehow preserve
this miraculous world...

479
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:53,166
If that's the answer to
the puzzle of my being,

480
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,666
I'd be happy.

481
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:59,208
It's logically sound
and even romantic, in a way.

482
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,000
[OKABE]
Kurisu.

483
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,500
Show me the sky.

484
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,500
[AMADEUS gasps]

485
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,250
I can't believe
how brilliant it is!

486
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,541
Yeah.

487
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,833
You all take it for granted,
living in a world

488
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,500
full of breathtaking beauty
that you just overlook.

489
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,875
Time flows on, mingling
with chaos and chance

490
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,041
to create miracles,
and shape fate.

491
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,875
It's almost overwhelming.

492
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,250
[AMADEUS]
Right?

493
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,250
[DARU]
I'm done setting everything up.

494
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,458
Well? Ready?

495
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,041
You sure?

496
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,500
[AMADEUS]
Yes.

497
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,166
[DARU]
Okay.

498
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,708
All that's left to do is
send Maho's attachment

499
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,291
to my past self.

500
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,041
Then that will be that,
if all goes according to plan.

501
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:06,875
[MAHO]
Amadeus.

502
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,500
Ready input to receive

503

506
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,500
[AMADEUS] Control code has

System is now transitioning

508

Run command from Hiyajo Maho,

No, modify command.

Thank you, ma'am.

513
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,250
Command confirmed.

Executing command from Hiyajo
Maho, top-level administrator.

Wait!

517
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,250
The possibilities are endless.

518
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,833
Do your best--never give up!

519
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,750
I know you better
than anyone else, ma'am.

520
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:04,000
So I can say
with confidence...

521
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:07,333
...you'll surpass my research,
by leaps and bounds, I'm sure.

522
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,041
You'll accomplish things
my original self

523
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,750
could only dream of!

524
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,750
And then, someday, we'll create
a world that's worthy of us all.

525
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,208
I know we can do it!

526
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,000
I have no doubt
that we'll get there!

527
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,750
[OKABE]
Amadeus, I swear to you!

528
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,041
Upon that promised day,
when time intersects,

529
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,875
I know without a doubt
that we'll reach that place.

530
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,458
And you and I shall meet again!

531
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,416
[AMADEUS] Ma'am!
Take care of him for me!

532
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,666
Our Hououin Kyouma!

533
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,583
Kurisu!

534
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,250
Go!

535
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,041
