[footsteps]

00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,541
[SUZUHA]
So this is where you've been.

3
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,208
I should have guessed.

4
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,208
[MAYURI]
Oh, Suzu.

5
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:33,458
Dad and the others
are looking for you.

6
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,750
They said they're about
to kick off the operation.

7
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:37,916
Mayu?

8
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,125
[MAYURI]
What if...

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,750
What if I'd acted differently?

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,791
[MAYURI] If I'd just done
things another way...

11
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:53,041
...and reached my hand out?

12
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,166
Would this future be different?

13
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,000
[MAYURI]
That day...

14
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,666
...if my Hikoboshi had
burned bright just once more,

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
it might have changed
everything for us.

16
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,708
[MAYURI]
What if when he fell...

17
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,708
...I'd reached out
and touched him?

18
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,708
[MAN 01A]
You are drifting down.

19
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,833
Plunging through your memories.

20
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:57,208
As you sink ever deeper,
you see a light.

21
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:59,625
It entrances you.

22
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,833
Tell me, what color
is the light?

23
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,291
It's red.

24
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,208
[MAN 01A] Standing within
this brilliant aura

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,250
is someone of great
importance to you.

26
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,833
Is it a family member?

27
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,541
She's not.

28
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,750
Then a friend, perhaps.
Or maybe a lover?

29
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,583
[OKABE]
She doesn't even know me.

30
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,916
She and I... We haven't...

00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:29,625
[MAYURI gasps]

32
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,458
[MAYURI]
Okarin!

33

Uh--

34
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,666
[MAYURI giggles]

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,125
[OKABE]
Hey, what gives?

36
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,541
I told you there was no reason
to wait around for me.

37
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,416
[MAYURI chuckles]

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,375
How was your session?

39
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,708
Good.

40
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,291
Turns out hypnotherapy
works well

41
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,458
for someone with a
robust temporal lobe.

42
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,916
The doc says I'll be fine.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,625
Wow! You mean it?

44
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:53,041
Yeah, but he does want me
to keep up the counseling

45
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:53,958
for a while.

46
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,833
You were right about it helping.

47
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,416
I'm glad I took your advice.

48
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,000
[MAYURI]
That's such a relief.

49
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,250
Honestly, it seemed
like you were

50
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,666
having a pretty
rough time lately.

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,333
I'm sorry if I worried you.

52
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,416
[MAYURI]
Mm-mm.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,416
How 'bout we go
grab a bite to eat?

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,666
It's my treat.

55
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,958
In that case, why don't
we head over to Akiba

56
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:14,416
for old time's sake?

57
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,916
[OKABE]
Huh?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,500
[MAYURI] Ruka and Faris invited
me out a little while ago

59
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,333
and it sounded like fun.

60
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,000
Akihabara, huh?

61
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,041
Can we?

62
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,625
[OKABE]
Sure. Of course.

63
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,708
[MAYURI]
That's the best news!

64
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,500
I'll tell everyone we're
on our way. One sec!

65
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,375
Hey, Faris!
Guess what! Guess what!

66
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,208
[OKABE]
It's cold.

67
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,333
Somehow, December already.

68
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,833
[OKABE]
And yet...

69
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,541
...it feels like the summer
happened moments ago.

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,250
[door chimes]

71
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,791
Let's see.

72
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,750
They said they'd be waiting
in here for us somewhere, so...

73
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,250
[MAYURI gasps]

74
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,083
[MAYURI]
Ruka! Faris! We're here!

75
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,083
Too-too-roo!

76
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,791
I'm glad you could
make it, Mayuri.

77
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,500
Kyouma!

78
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,000
[OKABE]
Rukako. Faris.

79
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,750
Been a while since
I've seen you.

80
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,041
We're well aware.

81
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,166
[FARIS] Kyouma! I missed
you so much, meow!

82
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,291
[OKABE] Hey! Will you
cut this nonsense out?

83
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,541
[FARIS]
What for, meow?

84
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,666
Kyouma knows he likes it, meow.

85
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,125
[OKABE]
All right. More importantly,

86
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,916
will you please stop
calling me that?

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,791
Meow come?

88
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,375
Because it's from the dark past.

89
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,958
[FARIS grunts] Just tell me who
I have to paw to get it back!

90
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,208
These claws'll show 'em
not to mess with my Kyouma.

91
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,458
--Of course.
--[RUKA] You know,

92
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,458
this kinda feels
like the old days.

93
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,000
I go to the lab
every now and then,

94
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,125
but I never see you
there anymore, Okabe.

95
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,583
[OKABE]
Well, I've been quite busy.

96
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,750
Don't tell me!

97
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,708
You've been captured
by a secret society?

98
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:51,250
Unfortunately, I'm just swamped
with college seminars.

99
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,625
But there are clubs as well.

100
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,625
Meow! Meow!

101
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,541
You actually joined a club?

102
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:58,416
Do you guys research UFOs
and Bigfoots and stuff?

103
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,625
No. I'm now a tennis star!

104
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,208
--[RUKA] Are you serious?
--[FARIS] What?!

105
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,250
[MAYURI chuckles]

106
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,166
One of my professors
is the advisor.

107
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,833
You'd be shocked
at my proficiency.

108
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,875
I never really pegged
you as a sportsman.

109
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,375
[MAYURI] Look out, Wimbledon!
Here comes Okarin.

110
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,833
[RUKA]
So practicing day and night

111
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,291
must be why you're
so busy, right?

112
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,708
Well, uh, it's not
really that intensive.

113
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,541
Then what have you
been doing without us?

114
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,333
[OKABE] Well, if you must know,
I've had some, uh, group dates.

115
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,125
--[FARIS] Group?
--[RUKA] Dates!

116
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,000
--[FARIS screams]
--[RUKA] What?!

117
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,458
Dates with multiple girls?

118
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,291
What perverted group
are you running in?

119
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,083
And you think it's okay
to flaunt your love life

120
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,541
in front of us?

121
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,541
--College has changed you.
--You disgust me, meowster.

122
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,166
Why are you ganging up on me?

123
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,541
I'm just partaking in
normal student affairs.

124
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,708
[FARIS]
You are so gross!

125
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:41,666
--[MAYURI chuckles]
--I expected better!

126
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,000
Explain yourself, Kyouma.

127
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,125
[RUKA]
How could you, Okabe?

128
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,750
[MAYURI gasps]
A message from Yuki!

[MAYURI]
Mm-mm.

132
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,250
She wants to know if
I'm around Akiba now

133
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,166
because she has something
she really wants to show me.

134
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,041
At the lab.

135
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,166

137
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,875
[OKABE]
In that case...

138
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,333
...let's go!

139
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,000
[DARU]
Why you dirty...

140
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,833
[DARU]
This calls for all-out war!

141
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,166
Leave no comment left untrolled!

142
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,125
"Normals Must Die-P"
was never one of us!

143
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,625
He's nothing but a damned liar!

144
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:24,500
How could you marry
Parthenon, you fraud?!

145
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,833
[SUZUHA]
Cool it, Dad.

146
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,250
[DARU] Whoa! @channel
and Twipo are on fire.

147

--[SUZUHA groans]
--I bet those two get doxxed!

148
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,583
I can't believe I didn't
know about this sooner!

00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,208
This is why you never
step away from--

00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,291
[gasps]

151
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,666

Listen to me if you wanna live.

152
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,875
[DARU whimpers]

153
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,916
[DARU] Suzuha, put that down
or Daddy will get angry!

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,416

plenty mad for both of us!

Right. Sorry.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,583
[SUZUHA]
Get it together!

157
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,416
All you ever do
around here is nap,

158
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,708
play games, and mess
around on the internet!

159
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,166
[DARU]
Not my fault every time I start

160
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,291
working on time
machines, I crash.

161
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,416
Plus, we've already got one.

162
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,541
You could just use
that as my template.

163
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,791
[SUZUHA]
No, I can't,

164
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,166
because it's the one you
invented in the future!

165
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,625
If you saw it now,
you'd run the risk

166
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,208
of creating a time paradox
and all kinds of problems.

167
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,208
Well, if it's guaranteed
that I make the thing,

168
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,333
then who cares?

169
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,291
I'll get right on it! Tomorrow!

170
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,541
[SUZUHA]
I am telling you,

171
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:17,708
it is time you started
working on it seriously.

172
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,625
[sighs] I remember Mom
used to get on your back

173
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,458
for procrastinating like this.

174
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,250
[DARU]
I'd welcome her on my back.

175
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,833
Know what I mean? [chuckles]

176
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,208
That's so gross!

177
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,041
[DARU]
Yeah, forget that.

178
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,291
[SUZUHA]
In the future,

179
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,833
you always say
that this world line

180
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,625
is the worst one imaginable.

181
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,041
But having me
was the best thing

182
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,500
that ever happened
to the two of you.

183
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,333
I came here to convince
Uncle Okarin that somehow

184
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,000
we could figure out a way
to change the future.

185
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,500
But since that day,

186
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,708
he hasn't been back to the
lab and nothing is different.

187
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:51,958
[SUZUHA gasps]

188
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,083
[SUZUHA]
Someone's here.

189
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,583
[footsteps]

190
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,083
Uh, what are the
chances it's Okarin?

191
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,166
It's not! I hear
boots. It's Mom!

192
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,666
[gasps]

193
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,541
[DARU]
You gotta hide!

194
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,083
I am so on it!

195
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,375
--[knocking]
--[DARU gasping]

196
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,916
--[DARU] Yeah? Come in.
--[door opens]

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Hello, hello! How was your day?

198
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,875
[DARU]
Ah. Amane, hey!

199
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,833
What brings you to the lab?

200
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,875
[YUKI giggles]

201
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,041
[YUKI]
Oh, dear. Mayuri isn't here?

202
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,958
Mayushii? No,
I haven't seen her.

203
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,375
Oopsie! I think I must be early.

204
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,750
She said she was
gonna meet me here

205
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:35,916
with some of the other girls.

206
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,083
[DARU]
That so?

207
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,000
Do you mind if I wait
in here with you?

208
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,416
[DARU]
Uh, no, sure!

209
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,250
Perfect. Thank you!

210
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,708
Um, is your little sister
out and about in town today?

211
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,500
Huh? Little sister?
What do you mean?

212
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,750
I'm sorry. Your little sister.

213
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:54,416
Um, well, all of my little
sisters are strictly 2D.

214
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,708
Uh--oh, yeah! You were
talking about Suzuha!

215
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,250
[YUKI] Of course.
Who else would it be?

216
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,625
Uh...

217
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,625
--[sighs]
--Well... nobody?

218
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,000
[door opens]

219
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,375
Too-too-roo!

220

[DARU gasps]

221
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,458
Oh, there you are!

222
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,625
Too-too-roo, to you,
Yuki! [giggles]

223
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,541
[FARIS]
Meow, meow!

224
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,708
Yay! Faris and Ruka came, too!

225
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,666

Faris, my feline fantasy!

227
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,500
[OKABE]
What do ya know?

228
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,041
Nothing's changed.

229
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,250
[DARU]
Okarin!

230
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,333
Mind if I come in?

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,833
Hallucinations and
memory problems

232
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,250
prompting the
Ministry of Health to...

233
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,041
You don't have to ask
me for permission.

234
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,333
It's your lab, isn't it?

235
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,833
I suppose so.

236
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,875
[MAYURI gasps]

237
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,000
Wow, Yuki, your clothes
are so cute!

238
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,166
I knew that's what
you were going to say!

239
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,541
That's why I wanted
to show you.

240
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,791
[FARIS whines] Do a catwalk
twirl for me, please!

241
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,166
[DARU] We've got some sodas
here if you're thirsty.

242
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,166
Wait, Okarin!
Where are you going?

243
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,333
What? Can't a man use
his lab's bathroom?

244

--[DARU sputters]

[DARU grunts, clears throat]

246
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,833
The toilet's been
acting kinda weird!

247
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,125
[OKABE]
Uh...

248
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,458

Are you okay?

Oh, hi, Suzu.

Um, hey, there! [chuckles]

So pretty!

It's a feast for my eyes

266
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,458
and I'm about to
order seconds, girl!

267
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:57,875
[YUKI giggles]

268
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,625
Hey, where did Okarin go?

269
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,208
He went up to the roof
with Suzuha earlier.

270
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,125
Seemed like they wanted to
talk about something important.

271
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,541
Oh, okay.

272
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,125
[OKABE] You didn't have
to come up with a lie

273
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,041
in the first place, you know.

274
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,625
Saying you're his little
sister complicates things.

275
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,416
Makes you more suspicious.

276
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,708
[SUZUHA] I get that,
but how was I supposed to know

277
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,916
that Mom would wanna
hang out with me so much?

278
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,583
[OKABE] We should've had a plan
before Daru and Yuki met.

279
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,833
[SUZUHA]
That day at Summer ComiMa.

280
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,875
Who knew she'd be one of
Mayu's cosplay friends

281
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,208
before she'd ever met Dad?

282
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:34,583
--[thud]
--[YUKI, DARU gasp]

283

Huh?

285
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,250
[SUZUHA]
And suddenly, there she was.

286
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,708
[sputtering]

287
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,416
[OKABE] She has no idea that one
day she'll give birth to you.

288
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,833
I wonder if she
feels a connection

289
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
even if she can't
quite place it.

290
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,333
[SUZUHA] Dad said he'll explain
everything sooner or later.

291
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,375
When the time's right.

292
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,291
[OKABE]
Hm.

293
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,625
Still though,

294
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:06,666
it's hard to believe they'll
have a kid together.

295
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,125
Well, get used to it,

296
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,416
because the fact
that I'm still here

297
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,458
means the future
hasn't changed at all.

298
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,958
[jet engine roaring]

299
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,333

301
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:24,000
[SUZUHA]
This world's so peaceful.

302
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,833
[SUZUHA]
No one knows to be scared.

303
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,916
By the time I was grown up,

304
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,125
you'd only see scenes like
these in photos and old movies.

305
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,125
[OKABE] World War III
ravages everything.

306
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,875
[SUZUHA] Yeah, and because
Dad and the others

307
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,083
were building a time machine,

308
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,666
we were seen as
a rebel organization.

309
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,750
[OKABE]
At least you and your parents

310
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,250
managed to escape alive somehow.

311
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,333
[SUZUHA]
No, my Mom was mowed down

312
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:49,208
in a barrage of bullets
trying to protect me

313
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,125
--[OKABE gasps]
--from a military drone.

314
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,916
[sighs]

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,250
I saw her body ripped to
shreds right before my eyes.

316
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:02,000
I was practically
showered in her blood.

317
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,708
Uncle Okarin?

318
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,583
The future in store for this
world line is a living hell.

319
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,083
[SUZUHA] So many countries start
fighting over time machines

320
00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:18,416
that the death toll
is unfathomable.

321
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,375
There are decades of
horror and despair ahead!

322
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:24,458
We're talking about the lives
of billions of people here!

323
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,833
You can change it!

324
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,041
[OKABE gasping]

325
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,833
I am begging you.

326
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,833
Please. Please...

327
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:32,791
[OKABE]
I can't.

328
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,541
[gasps] Uncle!

329
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,583
[OKABE] I've drifted through
so many different world lines

330
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:37,875
that I've lost count.

331
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,125
[SUZUHA gasps]

332
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
[OKABE]
The one constant is that

333
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,041
no matter what
reality I step into,

334
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,083
time machines destroy lives.

335
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,916
I've seen them drive you
to ruin, too, damn it!

336
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
Over and over.

337
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,916
Loops of misery.

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,250
Believe me, I know how useless
someone can be against time!

339
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,750
[OKABE]
No matter what I tried...

340
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,708
...I was powerless.

341
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,833
You say that, but you have
altered world lines before.

342
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,208
You told me that yourself.

343
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,458
So then... why not?

344
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
[OKABE]
It won't work!

345
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,416
You can't just change the
past to switch world lines!

346
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,375
It breaks the fundamental rules
that govern our universe.

347
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,375
Humans like us were never meant
to tamper with such powers.

348
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,250
The moment we start
meddling, we're punished!

349
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,625
It's too much!

350
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,083
I'd rather tear my eyes out
than see it all again!

351
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,750
Only you can do it.

352
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,208
[OKABE panting]

353
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,333
[SUZUHA]
We still have some time.

354
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,375
Please give it another
thought, for me!

355
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,458
This isn't over.

356
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,000
--[door opens]
--I haven't given up.

357
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,083
[door slams]

358
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,375
[MAYURI] I guess Suzu had other
stuff she needed to do, huh?

359
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,916
[OKABE]
Yeah.

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
The two of you didn't fight
up there on the roof, did you?

361
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,916
[OKABE]
That's not what happened.

362
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,375
[MAYURI]
I see.

363
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:59,000
Ooh! I didn't think it was
gonna be this chilly today.

364
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,750
[MAYURI] At least the lab
was lively for a change.

365
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:09,166
It was a lot of fun
seeing everyone.

366
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,375
Is that right?

367
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,791
Yep!

368
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,875
To be honest with you,

369
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,583
for some reason,
I've felt really lonely

370
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,750
every time I've gone
over there lately.

371
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,875
It's been sad.

372
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,583
[OKABE]
Even though Daru's there?

373
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,625
[MAYURI]
Yeah.

374
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,041
And it's strange,
because before,

375
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,208
I used to wait in the lab
all by myself for you,

376
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,666
so I should be used to that.

377
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,583
There's no reason for me
to feel alone when I'm there.

378
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,291
But it's just...

379
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,666
Sometimes it's so overwhelming
that it makes me want to cry.

380
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,416
--[OKABE gasps]
--Big ugly tears, you know?

381
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,750
Kind of feels like
there used to be

382
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,125
a bunch more people
hanging around.

383
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,083
[OKABE]
It's an illusion.

384
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh?

385
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,583
[OKABE]
Just a dream.

386
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:47,541
[OKABE]
There were only three people

387
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,750
that ever came to the lab.

388
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,875
You and me, and Daru
at the computer.

389
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,750
[MAYURI]
Hmm, I guess you're right.

390
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,500
[phone vibrates]

391
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,166
[MAYURI]
Is it a bad message?

392
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,208
[OKABE] No. Some people from
Viktor Chondria University

393
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,750
are giving a seminar
in Akiba tomorrow.

394
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,041
I was hoping to talk with
one of their professors,

395
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,083
but I guess they've gone
out drinking for the night.

396
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,333
[MAYURI gasps]
So weird!

397
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,250
It's like you're
totally normal now.

398
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,166
I'll be perfectly
fine by myself.

399
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,916
Go meet them!

400
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,041
[OKABE]
Okay.

401
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,583
Sorry for ditching you.

402
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:51,875

403
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,750
[OKABE] Artificial
Intelligence Revolution.

404
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,000
Viktor Chondria University.

405
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,208
Professor Alexis Leskinen.

406
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,583
[OKABE]
It's... the college she went to.

407
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,666
[MAKISE]
I'm so scared.

408
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,000
I think I'm dying.

409
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,125
But... I don't want to die!

410
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:29,166

[MAHO]
Hey. Excuse me.

415
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,833
[MAHO]
You work here, right?

416
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,250
[OKABE]
Uh--huh?

417
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,750
Which way do I go to
get to the staff room?

418
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:17,166
Uh...

419
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,791
--[MAHO] Hmm?
--[OKABE] Uh...

420
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,041
Oh, you must be lost.

421
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,750
This is a university-level
conference.

422
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,416
I'm well aware, you idiot!

423
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,625
[OKABE stammers]

424
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,708
[MAHO sighs]
It's the same thing every time.

425
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,791
[OKABE]
What do you mean?

426
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,041
You're the fourth
person to tell me

427
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,708
I'm in the wrong place
since I arrived here.

428
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,208
"Viktor Chondria University."

429
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,625
Part of the Brain
Science Institute.

430
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,500
Oh, I get it. You're
returning someone's--

431
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,875
Ugh! Fourth time for that, too!

432
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,916
[MAHO grunts]

433
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,208
[OKABE] Wait, you're telling me
the school is letting in...

434
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,375
...middle schoolers?

435
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,916
[MAHO]
Now you're just being insulting!

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,208
There's no university that
accepts people that young!

437
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,500
[OKABE]
You're 21 years old?

438
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,916
[MAHO] In other words,
I'm a full-grown woman!

439
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,083
Not in middle school,
elementary school, or preschool!

440
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:04,250
You got that?

441
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,666
But--sure.

442
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,291
[OKABE]
I was in the wrong.

443
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,541
[gasps]

444
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,375
[OKABE]
I'm sorry.

445
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,333
[MAHO scoffs]
Yeah, okay, whatever.

446
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,458
It's always like this,
no matter what country I go to.

447
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,500
[OKABE]
Shocking.

448
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,666
What was that?

449
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,541
[OKABE]
Uh, nothing! Just a cough.

450
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,791
[sighs]

451
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,625
[OKABE]
Uh, wrong direction.

452
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,791
You want the staff room?
Go out that way,

453
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,958
and then it's the door
at the end of the hall.

454
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,250
Thanks for the help.

455
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,916
[OKABE]
Twenty-one, huh?

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,791
I can practically
hear Daru shouting,

457
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,791
"Legal loli for the win!"

458
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,791

459
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,250
[OKABE]
That's... Kiryuu Moeka!

460
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,583
[OKABE]
Why...?

461
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,416
What is she doing here?

462
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,666
[OKABE]
No. Not again!

463
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,958
Calm down.

464
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,791
This is the beta world line.

465
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,666
It's nothing like the other one.

466
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,291
[OKABE]
It can't be.

467
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,875

It's...

470
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,000
[OKABE]
...that girl.

471
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,416
Good day, everyone.

472
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,416
[MAHO speaking Japanese]

473
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,875
[ALEXIS] Thank you for
attending my seminar.

474
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,666
I am Alexis Leskinen from
Viktor Chondria University's

475
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,041
Brain Science Institute.

476
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,458
This is my interpreter
and assistant, Hiyajo Maho.

477
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,291
[speaking Japanese]

478
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,000
[applause]

479
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,958
The topic of today's
seminar is broad.

480
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,500
[MAHO in English]
The topic of today's seminar

481
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,833
is the artificial
intelligence revolution.

482
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,041
But before we delve
too much into that,

483
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
there's a thesis I'd like
to familiarize you with.

484
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,041
[MAHO] This paper was published
by a brilliant female researcher

485
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,375
from our university laboratory.

486
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,125
All of our memories are stored
within the cerebral cortex.

487
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,458
More specifically,

488
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:06,708
our histories are held
within the temporal lobe.

489
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:09,750
Our minds work as if they have
a computer's flash memory.

490
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,375
The brain sends
electrical signals

491
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:13,958
between neurons at
lightning-fast rates.

492
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:17,125
Ultimately, it is the pattern
of these electrical signals

493
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,208
which create and
reinforce memories.

494
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,291
They archive our pasts.

495
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,583
[MAHO] I regret to say
that the bright woman

496
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,000
who proposed this theory

497
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,125
passed away at the
young age of 18.

498
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,083
But using her theory
as a foundation,

499
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,291
we were able to construct
a monumental computer program.

500
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,125
That is a system that
preserves human memory

501
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,541
as electronic data.

502
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,583
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

503
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,083
[MAHO] Though previous
systems fell short

504
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,500
of having real identities,

505
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,583
we've developed an
artificial intelligence

506
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,166
built with data drawn from
actual human memories.

507
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:00,166
Yes. It has feelings and
memories, just like a human.

508
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,125
AI with a brain and a heart.

509
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,333
The genius of Makise
Kurisu and her theory

510
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,416
enabled us to build this system.

511
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,625
Without further ado,

512
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:11,333
we would like to demonstrate
the AI named...

513
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,000
[MAHO]
...Amadeus.
