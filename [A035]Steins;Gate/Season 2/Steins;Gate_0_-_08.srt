letting me know you were here.

Oh, Happy New Year, I guess.

That's the part where
you're supposed to say it back.

8
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,666
Or maybe it's already too late
to wish people Happy New Year?

00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,291
Anyway... I'm
shocked to see you.

Don't worry about it.

Happens to me
sometimes, too.

Were you thinking of her?

Mayuri, I mean.

Huh?

00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,000
I can't come here without
the memories flooding in.

00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,833
I hear her footsteps,
then the door opens,

Please, it's fine.

I really should have known
better. It's too soon.

Now that I think about it,

36
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,500
you haven't even
set foot in this place.

37
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,958

happened with Mayuri.

Guess not.

just disappeared,

in this alpha world line,

Mayuri and I
were cosplay friends,

that she meant the world to me.

to help out at May Queen

after our sweet
Mayushii left us.

[FUBUKI]
It's been hard for me,

99
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,083
but I know that Mayuri
would have wanted me

100
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,333
to be around other people

101
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,125
who loved her.

Here's a picture of us
at Summer ComiMa.

103

The outfits she made us
were so cute.

104
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,583
We took this picture,
so we could remember it forever.

105

She was always so energetic.

106
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,125
[voice breaking] And she seemed
healthy, so I was shocked.

107
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,458
One minute she was alive,
and the next--

00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,833
Mayushii would want you to smile
when you remember her, not cry.

[OKABE]
What is with you?

122
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,541
[DARU]
There are things you should say,

123
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,000
and things you should
definitely not say!

124
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,875
You want to talk about a world
where Mayuri's alive?

125
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,333
You're the one who
couldn't make the choice

126
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:24,291
to keep her with us in this one!

127
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,583
We had Echelon's data hacked.

128
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,375
Cracked wide open.

129
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,333
But you
couldn't pull the trigger!

130
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,208
You mean I couldn't
press the "enter" key?

131

[DARU]
Yeah.

132
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,833
And then you wouldn't
shut up about it.

133
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,083
You kept saying,
"I'm the one who killed her.

134
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,000
I did it. I killed Mayuri."

135
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:46,041
You made the choice that
effectively ended Mayuri's life.

136
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,416
[DARU]
And then, to top it off,

137
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,000
you destroyed the Phone Wave
and Time Leap Machine?

138
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,958
If you knew you were
going to regret it later,

139
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,750
you should have thought
about that and kept it intact!

140
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,208
Just like Miss Makise
begged you to.

141

142
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:00,625
[DARU] She thought
we had another chance!

143
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,583
We could have
tried it all again!

144
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,916
There must have been
something we hadn't thought of!

Oh, Hashida.
It's been a while.

148
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,250
Happy New Year, by the way.

149
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,875
[DARU]
Yeah, Happy New Year and stuff.

150
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,291
[MAKISE]
This is a surprise.

151
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,833
What's going on?
You practically never call me.

152
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,875
I saw Okarin in Akiba.

153
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,375
Oh?

154
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,500
[DARU] I'm guessing he came
to the lab, too, didn't he?

155
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:29,958
'Course. Did he say
anything strange?

156
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,083
Yeah.

157
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,583
He still isn't over
Mayushii's death.

158
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,833
And then he just started
raving about another world

159
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,708
where she could
somehow be alive.

160
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,250
What'd you say?

161
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,958
[DARU sighs]
I got pissed.

162
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,000
I-I couldn't believe he'd have
the balls to say all that

163
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,000
after everything that happened.
