1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,375
[RUKA] All right,
we're off to the store.

2
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,625
Be back soon.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,916
[MAYURI] If you think of
anything else we need,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,208
just text me, okay?

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,083
Roger that.

6
00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:18,291
[door closes]

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,458
[RUKA]
You don't have to come. Really.

8
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,333
[RUKA gasps]

9
00:00:26,416 --> 00:00:27,625
Even if I didn't go,

10
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,500
it's not like I'd be
any help here. [chuckles]

11
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,750
Are we taking the long route?

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,791
[SUZUHA]
You lost all your memories?!

13
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,875
Yes.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,166
So you can't remember
a single thing

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,791
that happened since we--

16
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,041
No way!

17
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,375
Look, Suzuha,
what makes you so certain

18
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,416
this is Kagari Shiina
in the first place?

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,958
I already told you that!

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,333
Because of the oopa!

21
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,541
It's the exact same one
I saw her mom give her.

22
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,916
It was Kagari's good luck charm.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,833
She took it with her everywhere!

24
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,083
Where did you get yours, Kana?

25
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:07,583
I have no idea.

26
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,125
When they first found me,
it was the only thing I had.

27
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:13,583
I was clutching it,
even though I was unconscious.

28
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,125
You were unconscious?

29
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,041
[KAGARI]
Yes.

30
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:17,166
I guess I had collapsed

31
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,416
near the border of
the Chiba Prefecture

32
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,458
and a priest nearly tripped
over me lying in the path.

33
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,833
So, then, how'd you
end up at the shrine?

34
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,375
[KAGARI]
They felt it was inappropriate

35
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:29,000
for a girl to stay too long
at a practicing temple, so...

36
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:30,416
[SUZUHA]
She was at Ruka's!

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,083
Right under my nose
this whole time!

38
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,083
Tell me!

39
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:36,125
Is my name really
Kagari Shiina?

40
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,583
Do you know that for sure?

41
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:41,208
Can you two tell me
anything else about who I am?

42
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,541
--I need to--
--Wait. One thing at a time.

43
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,333
[KAGARI gasps]
Yes, I'm sorry.

44
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:46,625
Don't be.

45
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,500
When you hear the name
"Kagari Shiina,"

46
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:51,583
does it, perhaps,
bring back other memories?

47
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:54,375
No, not that I'm aware of.

48
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,708
And yet, it does give me an
intense, nostalgic feeling.

49
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,458
That girl who just
left with Ruka...

50
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,250
Do you mean Mayuri?

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,250
Oh, Mayuri?

52
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,208
Is that her name, then?

53
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,041
[KAGARI chuckles]

54
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,041
[KAGARI]
And mine is...

55
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,500
...Kagari Shiina.

56
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,208
[OKABE]
Kagari Shiina.

57
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,208
In 2036, she's...

58
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,958
...Mayuri's daughter.

59
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,541
[RUKA] So, just to
make sure I understand,

60
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,958
you're saying that Kana--

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,875
I mean, Kagari,
is somebody you know, Suzuha?

62
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:01,791
[SUZUHA]
Uh, yeah!

63
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,041
That's it, more or less.

64
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:06,125
[RUKA] Awesome! Do you
know where she lives?

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,875
Can you get in touch
with some of her family

66
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,250
and tell them she's okay?

67
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,416
Uh, I don't--I, uh...

68
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,041
Uh, well, Kagari moved to
a different neighborhood

69
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,583
when they were
still really young,

70
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,500
and Suzuha lost contact
with her at that point.

71
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,958
Oh, too bad.

72
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,416
Hey, at least we were able
to find out your real name.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,291
That's something!

74
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,125
[sighs]

75
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,666
[MAYURI]
Hang on!

76
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,625
Kagari's real, full name is
Kagari Shiina, isn't that right?

77
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,333
Yeah, it is.

78
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:32,708
That means you and I
are alike in a way!

79
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,791
Because, you see,
my full name's Mayuri Shiina.

80
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,916
Mayuri Shiina?

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,458
Oh.

82
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:42,041
Ruka told me something about
you, but I couldn't believe it!

83
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,625
You have amnesia?

84
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:44,541
For real?

85
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,416
I do.

86
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,750
[MAYURI]
So that means...

87
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,916
...you don't remember
anything about who you are

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,958
or where you come from?

89
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,166
That's right.

90
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,958
[MAYURI]
Oh, wow.

91
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,041
Sorry.

92
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,208
That has to be really
painful for you.

93
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,666
Because it means
you can't remember

94
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,750
all the people you love
the most in the world.

95
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:02,916
Seriously.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,583
Amnesia must be
the saddest thing

97
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,708
that could ever
happen to anyone.

98
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,416
It's heartbreaking!

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,375
So, um, if you ever
need help with something,

100
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
just tell me! I'd be happy
to do whatever I can!

101
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
I'm here, okay?

102
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,708
[KAGARI gasps]

103
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,875
Oh, hey! What's the matter?

104
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,000
Why are you crying?

105
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,791
Did I say something
I shouldn't have?

106
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,166
No, not at all.

107
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,208
I'm crying because I'm happy.

108
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,541
You really touched me just now.

109
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,541
I'm not the only one
who's here for you.

110
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,958
[KAGARI gasps]

111
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,208
[OKABE]
Mm.

112
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,250
Yeah. If you need me,
just ask, and I'm there!

113
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,625
Don't hesitate.

114
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,625
Thank you all. That means a lot.

115
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,166
[OKABE] It appears that we
found Kagari Shiina ourselves.

116
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,666
Where was she?

117
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,958
[OKABE] At a local shrine
where one of my friends lives.

118
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,875
But she was found unconscious
on the outskirts of Chiba.

119
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,291
Why there?

120
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,375
I have no clue.

121
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,791
She's suffering from
severe amnesia.

122
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:03,916
[MOEKA]
I see.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,125
Any update on the
other search party?

124
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:06,958
Who they are?

125
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,791
[MOEKA]
No. Nothing yet.

126
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,583
[OKABE sighs]
No worries.

127
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:13,000
And I'm sorry, it's a busy
time of year as it is.

128
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,458
[MOEKA]
It's fine, work is work.

129
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,625
So what now?

130
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,708
Should I keep at it?

131
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,000
[OKABE]
If you don't mind.

132
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,833
It would be a great
help if you did.

133
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,041
[MOEKA]
Then I will.

134
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,500
That's that.

135
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,041
They found her.

136
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,125
[phone chimes]

137
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,291
[MAHO]
Hmm?

138
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,916
[MAHO sighs]

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,250
[footsteps]

140
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,625
--[REYES] Maho!
--[MAHO yelps]

141
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,000
[REYES giggles]

142
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,625
Professor! Not cool, come on!

143
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,833
Oh, wait. Were you messaging
with your boyfriend?

144
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,875
[MAHO]
He is not my boyfriend!

145
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,666
Why do you and Leskinen
keep harassing me about that?

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,666
The concept of love is
utterly useless, anyway!

147
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh.

148
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,291
You couldn't be
more mistaken, Maho.

149
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,000
[MAHO gasps]

150
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,250
As a matter of fact,

151
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,125
I'm more passionate
about your love life

152
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,250
than any other field of study.

153
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,125
That'd be flattering
if it weren't weird,

154
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,541
but I'd rather you not
treat me like a test subject.

155
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,666
Anyway, I'm not the type
to be swept off my feet

156
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,000
by the inherently
delusional nature of love.

157
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,958
Really? What a shame.

158
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,541
Also, Professor?

159
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,458
[REYES]
Mm?

160
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,083
[KAGARI] So, um,
I'm sorry for all of this.

161
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,000
[MAYURI]
There's no need to apologize!

162
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm here to help
with anything!

163
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,833
I meant what I said before!

164
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,791
Thank you.

165
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,666
I really do appreciate it.

166
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,166
Hey, Rukako,
do you have a second?

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,958
[RUKA]
You want me to try

168
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,166
to keep Kagari
from going outside?

169
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,291
That seems so...

170
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,583
[OKABE]
If she has to,

171
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,333
make sure someone
accompanies her.

172
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,833
And I can't say why.

173
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,083
Not right now anyway.

174
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,541
[RUKA]
I trust you.

175
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
It is weird, though.

176
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,416
[OKABE]
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,875
[OKABE]
We still don't know who else

178
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,833
has been searching for Kagari,

179
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,333
and until we do,

180
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,083
it's prudent for us to
take every precaution

181
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,666
we possibly can.

182
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,250
[DARU]
In any case,

183
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,750
it's pretty amazing that we were
able to find Kagari, right?

184
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,916
So now you can relax, for once.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,375
Yeah, I guess.

186
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:27,291
Okay, not exactly the relieved
response I was hoping for.

187
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,708
[SUZUHA]
That girl.

188
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,458
Where do you think
she's been all this time?

189
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,333
[DARU]
That is a good question.

190
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,041
[DARU] I've been wondering
about that part, too, actually.

191
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,791
But it's not like we can
force her to remember

192
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,875
and tell us everything,
you know?

193
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,916
Don't they say those memories
come back on their own,

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,125
out of nowhere?

195
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,666
All we can do now is be patient.

196
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,916
[SUZUHA]
Maybe.

197
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,250
But do we have that luxury?

198
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,666
[DARU]
Ooh, how 'bout this?

199
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,708
We could scare the crap
out of her to jog her memory.

200
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:57,875
Scaring chicks is
my strong suit!

201
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,541
Why--hey--

202
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,041
Wha--?

203
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,791
Why didn't it work?

204
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,000
It always works! [gasping]

205
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,250
[gasps]

206
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:11,000
[KAGARI] I won't let you
do something like that.

207
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:14,375
[KAGARI]
I hear... a voice.

208
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,916
[SUZUHA]
Kagari!

209
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,125
[gunshot]

210
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,541
Are you okay?

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,500
[DARU]
Hey, Okarin?

212
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,166
Aren't we supposed to be
going to the shrine right now

213
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,250
to celebrate the
New Year and stuff?

214
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,375
Uh, yeah, we are.

215
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,875
So, um, like, why are we stuck
in this awkward situation, then?

216
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,416
--[DARU whimpering]
--[BRAUN] Hey!

217
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,833
If you've got something to say,

218
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,166
then you'd better
speak up, nice and loud.

219
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,208
[DARU] No, we have
nothing at all to say, sir.

220
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,041
Oh?

221
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,125
Well, we were just hoping

222
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,125
we could get into
the lab, actually.

223
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,250
No way!

224
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,500
[DARU]
But why not?

225
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,125
Oh, such villainy!

226
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,958
Mr. Braun, we promised we
would meet the others here

227
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,916
to go to the shrine
for New Year's.

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,708
[KAEDE]
Sorry to keep you guys waiting!

229
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,041
[BOTH]
Huh?

230
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,666
[NAE giggles]

231
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,916
[BRAUN]
Nae, you're adorable!

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,208
Well, of course you are!

233
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,416
You're my daughter!

234
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,958
[BRAUN laughing]

235
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,208
Uh, Dad, you're hurting
me a little bit.

236
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,458
It's a good thing
she takes after mo--

237
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,791
Ahem.

238
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,583
I can't wait to go to
the shrine with everybody

239
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:35,250
and see Mayuri all dressed up
as a beautiful shrine maiden!

240
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,750
[BRAUN]
Yeah?

241
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,041
Well, listen to the girls
and behave yourself, got that?

242
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:40,208
[NAE]
Mm-hmm.

243
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,083
Oh, you're not coming with us?

244
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,375
[BRAUN] Nah, I got some
business to take care of.

245
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,041
If it weren't for that,
do you think I'm really be

246
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,083
leaving my precious daughter
with the likes of you?

247
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,083
Come on!

248
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,375
And let me be clear.

249
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,916
If anything happens to her,
you two will pay.

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,750
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

251
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,750
[NAE]
I'll see you later, Dad!

252
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,083
Well, we'd better get
going, don't ya think?

253
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:01,958
Indeed.

254
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,041
But before we do anything else,

255
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,500
aren't we forgetting
something really important?

256
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,458
All together now!

257
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,416
[ALL]
Happy New Year!

258
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,000
[FUBUKI]
I can't wait to see Mayushii's

259
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,416
shrine maiden costume!

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,666
[KAEDE] No, silly. This is
a uniform, not a costume!

261
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,666
[FUBUKI]
Oh, that's right!

262
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,125
[YUKI] Isn't Suzuha
working with Mayuri today?

263
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,875
I bet they're having fun.

264
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,125
Look, a shrine maiden
for a sister is one thing,

265
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,041
but you might as well
dress her as a nurse, too,

266
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,125
and raise her moe so
much she gains a level.

267
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,333
Plus one die roll, baby.

268
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,458
Hashida's even more
perverted than I am,

269
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:34,666
which is saying something.

270
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,333
[OKABE]
Hey, um, thanks for coming.

271
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,625
I know Mayuri's the
one who invited you,

272
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,000
but then she got
herself talked into

273
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,041
working as a shrine maiden.

274
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,000
[MAHO]
It's okay. I don't mind.

275
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,541
'Cause there's something
I want to discuss with you.

276
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,916
[YUKI]
Oh, by the way,

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,041
didn't you say you're a student

278
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,416
at an American
university, Hiyajo?

279
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,791
[MAHO]
Hm? Yeah.

280
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,708
Your research sounded
really interesting.

281
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,708
But tell me again.
Was it aye-ayes?

282
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,041
Lemurs? Cool.

283
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,041
It's AI. Not aye-ayes.

284
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,916
[FUBUKI]
So no lemurs, then? Noted!

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,166
[YUKI] Right, she studies
artificial intelligence,

286
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,458
something I'm super
interested in, actually.

287
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,291
I would love to sit down
and have a chat with you

288
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,000
about it sometime!

Uh--yeah, but...

353
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,250
I'm not as pretty.

354
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,500
Don't say that, Kagari!

355
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,375
You look beautiful in it!

356
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,791
[MAYURI]
Right, Okarin?

357
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,291
Huh? Of course!

358
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,958
You both look stunning.

359
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,916
[ALL laughing]

360
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,708
[DARU chuckles]

361
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,291
[YUKI giggles]

362
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:52,750
I'm kind of floored.

363
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,083
It's crazy. She's
just like Kurisu.

364
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,250
[OKABE]
You think?

365
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,000
[MAHO] Yeah, they're
identical... almost.

366
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,041
[OKABE]
I don't know.

367
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,791
I can't say I agree.

368
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,208
[sighs]

369
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,125
[MAHO] Anyway, I think
we understand each other.

370
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,208
About Amadeus, you mean.

371
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,833
Things can't go on
like they are,

372
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,041
or you won't ever get closure.

373
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,291
You need to make a choice

374
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,916
before work starts up
again after the holiday.

375
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,208
--I don't know.
--You have got to be kidding.

376
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,208
I've never actually
been to a shrine before.

377
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,458
Oh, thank you!

378
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,458
[laughs]

379
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,125
[MAHO groans]

380
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,416
Guess they couldn't
make it in time.

381
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,458
[OKABE]
Hm?

382
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,291
--[ALEXIS] Rintaro!
--[OKABE gasps]

383
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,333
[OKABE]
Professor?

384
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,416
Happy New Year,
Rintaro! [laughs]

385
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,583
I invited them,

386
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,250
because it's a special
occasion, and all.

387
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,875
[ALEXIS]
I thought this was a party.

388
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,041
Where are the Japanese
shaman girls?

389
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,458
[OKABE]
Shamans?

390
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,875
Oh, you mean the shrine maidens?

391
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,958
They're done working,
so they ditched the garb.

392
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,500
They just finished cleaning
and we were about to head out.

393
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,625
[ALEXIS]
Holy cow!

394
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,791
This is why I wanted
to get here earlier!

395
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,083
[REYES] You should
have thought about that

396
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,041
during your all-day
shopping spree.

397
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,666
Come on, let's go
visit the shrine.

398
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,666
No! You have to wash
your hands first.

399
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,416
[MAYURI]
Okarin!

400
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,833
Ruka's mom is so sweet.

401
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,375
She gave us a ton of
New Year's snacks!

402
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,916
Sorry if we kept you.

403
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,250
[REYES]
Rintaro! We'll see you around!

404
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:26,250
[OKABE]
Huh? Oh, leaving so soon?

405
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,791
He says the whole
point of coming here

406
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,166
was the shrine maidens.

407
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,708
Happy New Year! Bye!

408
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,875
[KAGARI]
Sorry!

409
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,083
That took longer
than I expected.

410
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,750
[NAE]
Yeah, it sure did!

411
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,333
I said sorry.

412
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,666
[OKABE]
Right-o, friends!

413
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,541
We should get going, ourselves.

414
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,041
[YUKI]
Oh, I wish I could.

415
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,750
I have to call it a day now.

416
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,541
You mean you're not coming
back to the lab with us?

417
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,291
They're short-staffed at work,
so I have to go in tonight.

418
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,833
Sorry, guys.

419
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,291
[MAYURI]
It's okay. Too bad.

420
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,625
I'll take a rain check,

421
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,791
and come back to play
with you some other time!

422
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,666
Well, shall we
head that direction?

423
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,875
Uh-huh.

424
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,375
Is everyone ready to
party till next year?

425
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,500
[ALL]
Yeah!

426
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,916
Let me heart it, guys.
One more time!

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,750
Here's to the best year
any of us have ever had!

428
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,083
[ALL]
Happy New Year to all of us!

429
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,500
Cheers!

430
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,916
[DARU]
Mmm! This <i>zoni</i> soup is tasty!

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Really hits the spot!

432
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,125
[FARIS]
Thanks! It's from May Queen's

special New Year's
Menu, meow!

434
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,541
So, in other words,
I'm tasting a bit of Faris?

435
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:31,750
Only you could find a way to
make soup perverted, Hashida.

436
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,500
These beans are so delicious,

437
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,166
and they're packed
with nutrients, too.

438
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,500
Here you go, Nae.
Have as much as you want!

439
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,833
Candied chestnuts in
mashed potatoes, yum!

440
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,208
Um, guys, there's no way
I have room for all that food!

441
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,708
[giggles]

442
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,458
Hey, if you don't eat,
you won't grow! Chow down!

443
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,541
[DARU] Okabe, you're
too skinny! Eat more!

444
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,625
[OKABE]
What are you, my grandmother?

445
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,416
Oh, no. We ran out
of tea so fast!

446
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,750
Sure did.

447
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,041
We can make a quick run
to the store and get some.

448
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,083
Huh?

449
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,458
[KAEDE gasps]
Hello, sir!

450
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,041
[FUBUKI]
It's the landlord dude!

451
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,666
You're back from
the shrine already?

452
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,208
So where's everyone else?

453
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,250
They're all upstairs
at the party.

454
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,375
The two of us are
going to get more tea.

455
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:12,708
Oh, yeah?

456
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,583
I'll pop by to pick up
Nae a little later, then,

457
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,500
but could you get a message
to Okabe for me?

458
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,000
Have him text me
when the party's over.

459
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,666
[KAEDE]
Yes, sir, of course.

460

What about this one?

464
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,416
[FARIS]
Ooh, try it, it's really good.

465
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,041
I think it's my fave, meow.

466
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,458
[gasps] Hello, ma'am!

467
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,583
Where have you been all night?

468
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:46,750
Hold on. Are you
where I think you are?

00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,958

[AMADEUS]
Uh, kind of, but not quite.

[OKABE gasps]

474
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,375
[FARIS]
Is that a friend of yours?

475
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,500
[AMADEUS]
I'm not even human, actually.

476
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,458
I'm artificial intelligence.

477
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,916
An AI that Maho helped develop.

478
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,250
Huh?

479
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,166
Yeah, AI. Not aye-aye.

480
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,125
For real?

481
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,041
Actual artificial intelligence?

[DARU gasps]

483
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,875
Huh?

484
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,416
[AMADEUS]
Hi, everyone.

485
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,083
I assume you're the other
members of Okabe's laboratory.

486
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,583
Please allow me to
introduce myself.

487
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,583
I am called Amadeus.

488
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,708
I am a program of
artificial intelligence

489
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,458
constructed from the
memories of Makise Kurisu.

490
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,875
Makise Kurisu, huh?

491
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,250
[AMADEUS]
Ah, of course.

492
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,458
You must have been acquaintances
of the original me.

493
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,416
Uh, well, I wasn't, actually.

494
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,166
I only knew about you from
your articles in <i>Sciency</i> .

495
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,791
[AMADEUS]
Huh! I'm impressed.

496
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,208
If you were reading
that magazine,

497
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,791
then you must have
some level of interest

498
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,083
in advanced sciences.

499
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,000
Uh, well, I work with
systems and networks,

500
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,625
which straddle the divide
between science and math.

501
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,166
--[AMADEUS] Yeah?
--[NAE] Hey, miss AI lady?

502
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,958
Are you, like, a computer game?

503
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,125
Can I play online?

504
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,083
[AMADEUS chuckles]
No, I'm not a game.

505
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,625
I'm real. I'm right here...

506
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,916
[MAHO]
I'm sorry.

507
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,125
It seems cruel to say
you should let her go,

508
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,208
then put her right in your face.

509
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,166
I didn't intend to.

510
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,166
No.

511
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,291
It's probably better this way.

512
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,333
[MAHO gasps]

513
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,125
It's painful,

514
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:26,458
but I must keep moving
forward regardless.

515
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:27,583
As for Kagari,

516
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,583
she might resemble
Kurisu in some ways,

517
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,958
but she isn't her at all.

518
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,625
Same with Amadeus.

519
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,416
It was created from parts of
Kurisu, that's indisputable,

520
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,625
but it's a separate entity.

521
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:41,208
I can't let my grief
drag me down.

522
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:44,208
That's what you've wanted to say
this whole time, isn't it, Maho?

523
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,250
[OKABE]
That's right.

524
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,125
Kurisu protected this world,

525
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,791
along with Mayuri and
everyone else in it.

526
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,250
For her sake, I have to
keep protecting it...

527
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,458
...without ever looking back.

528
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,375
I don't think
Suzuha understands.

529
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,750
She still thinks
this world isn't right.

530
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,625
But now that Kagari is here,

531
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,125
even if she doesn't
remember anything...

532
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,041
...maybe that'll change.

533
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,416
Oh, by the way,

534
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,208
is Okabe there with you--

535
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,375
[ALL]
Huh?

536
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,625
What's wrong?

537
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,750
[DARU]
It cut out all of a sudden.

538
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,000
Let me see.

539
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,375
[MAHO] Hmm. My phone seems
to be working just fine...

540
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,125
...but I can't connect
to the Amadeus server.

541
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,041
--[gasps]
--That's weird.

542
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,791
That's never happened before.

543
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,083
[MAYURI]
Oh, no! I just wound you!

544
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,416
Don't tell me you're broken.

545
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,541
So not fair!

546
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,875
I've taken extra good care
of you and everything.

547
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,166
[MAYURI]
Hmm?

548
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,375
Do you think the server
could be updating or what?

549
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,541
If so, no one thought
to tell me about it.

550
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,791
[gasps]

551
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,208
Okabe, someone's coming!

552
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,083
[OKABE gasps]

553
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,583
[ALL gasp]

554
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,416
[MAHO]
What's going on?

555
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,250
Is this a prank?

556
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,666
[MAN 06A]
Nobody move!

557
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,125
[OKABE]
What is this?

558
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,458
Okarin?

559
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,708
[OKABE]
Not again.

560
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,958
Please.
