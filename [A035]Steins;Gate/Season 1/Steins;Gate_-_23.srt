1
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:16,666
Seriously...
World War Three?

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,458
Let me put it into
perspective for you:

3
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,875
that's upwards of 5.7
billion human lives snuffed out

4
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,416
by the year 2036.
And it all starts with this.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,500
But... what is "this?"

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:31,083
Totally a mech...
Please tell me it transforms.

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,125
It's a time machine, Daru.

8
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,708
Sorry?

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,458
You're familiar with it...
That's good, Uncle...

10
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:40,458
Very good... I can
get to the point.

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,291
We're gonna run interference.

12
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,083
I refuse.

13
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,875
Okarin...

14
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,833
I've been jumping from
world-line to world-line

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,250
for weeks.

16
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:55,708
I've run interference...

17
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,083
So many times I'm barely
myself anymore...

18
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:00,708
The only way I was able to
land back onto this world-line

19
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,958
was by allowing Kurisu to die.

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,000
And now you're asking me
to go another round...?!

21
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:08,083
I refuse!

22
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,833
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,291
Kurisu...? Oh...

24
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,166
You mean the scientist
chick who got, like,

25
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,791
stabbed or whatever at the
Radio Building the other day?

26
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,708
Rintarou... Hear me out...

27
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,583
What if I told you the
circumstances

28
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,375
of her death on the
afternoon of July 28th, 2010

29
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:30,750
play directly into what
kicked off the war...?

30
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,083
That the reason I'm here,
is to see to it she survives?

31
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,250
I'm listening.

32
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,166
I don't have a clue
how it all dovetails...

33
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,791
All I know is I've
been entrusted

34
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,166
with an important mission...

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,458
Rescue Makise Kurisu and
shift things to a world-line

36
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:50,333
beyond the divergence barrier;
free of the attractor field...

37
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,666
A little place we
call Stein's Gate!

38
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,625
I don't believe it...

39
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,666
You actually hatched this
plan yourself...

40
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,625
By that I mean you will...

41
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,500
With dad...
Though you're the first

42
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,000
to admit it's pure conjecture...
Push comes to shove,

43
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,833
it's possible this is
all wishful thinking...

44
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,458
Even if a Stein's Gate
world-line exists,

45
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,791
the odds of us reaching
one are slim to none.

46
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,833
Odds be damned,
though: I'm all in...

47
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,541
As you always like to remind us:

48
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:55,208
nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right...?

49
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,125
If a future without World War
Three is worth the risk to you.

50
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,250
Take my hand.

51
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,333
Um... Okay to be honest,

52
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,250
I don't think I understood very
much of what just got said...

53
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,916
But...

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,125
This friend of yours...
This Makise Kurisu...?

55
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:22,916
Sounds to me like she's
worth taking a chance, right?

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,958
I, say you should go for it!

57
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,958
Face it, chief.
It's your cuppa tea...

58
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,041
All this World War Three
stuff seems, well...

59
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,291
No offense, you understand,

60
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,666
but tailor-made for your
special brand of crazy.

61
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:40,708
I do this for her, no
one else... Got it?

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,333
Whatever gets you there.

63
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,791
Climb aboard!

64
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,291
It can actually carry two?

65
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,208
Well, yeah... Like
this puppy's inventor

66
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,625
would've have skimped on
installing a backseat...

67
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,958
Be careful.

68
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,291
Leave your cell
phone here.

69
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:06,375
We'd all be screwed five
ways from Tuesday if it

70
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,791
crossed signals with the one
your past self'll be carrying.

71
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,125
Watch it for me?

72
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,208
Good luck, guys.

73
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,333
Nice, uh... set up you got.

74
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,833
Thanks... Works like a charm;

75
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,708
I've already stopped off
at 1975 and 2000...

76
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,833
She's running low on fuel,
though... That's the thing...

77
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,750
You've got to watch the
indicators like a hawk.

78
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:33,333
Wait. So we can not only go
backward in time, but forward?

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,666
I should hope so...

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,083
What the in hell'd be the
point if we couldn't?

81
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,208
I see... This one must come

82
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,708
from a different world line
than its twin...

83
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,291
Have a seat... I'm setting
coordinates for the day of,

84
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,916
just shy of twelve o'clock...

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,166
I don't dare go back any further

86
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,916
because I can't
change our position.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,916
If we stir up trouble
at the Radio Building

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,041
it might throw Kurisu's
movements out of whack.

89
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,541
We're about to pull an
ungodly amount of Gs here,

90
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,333
so you might want
to prepare yourself.

91
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,333
Okarin...

92
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,958
What are these?

93
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,125
They come with the territory.

94
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,791
Little beads of time...
Kinda pretty, huh?

95
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,958
Come on.

96
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:31,666
Sorry. I, uh... just need to
let my stomach settle a bit...

97
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,000
Somebody's a wuss...
Hurry it up!

98
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,125
'Kay, critical point:

99
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,125
avoid running into your
past self at all costs...

100
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,791
We could have a major paradox
on our hands otherwise...

101
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,000
How long do you
think this'll take?

102
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:49,833
Uh... Well... Maybe twenty
minutes, give or take?

103
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright, I'm going to stay
here and prep the time machine

104
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:55,166
for our return trip, and you do
what you can to save Makise.

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,375
Wish me luck.

106
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,000
July 28th...

107
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,208
The day I found
Kurisu on the floor,

108
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:02,583
soaked in her own blood...

109
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,833
Mayuri and I had come to
see Dr. Nakabachi's lecture

110
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:06,916
and were waiting
for it to start

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,750
when we heard a sound
on the roof...

112
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,250
That's right.

113
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,791
This must be when Mayuri
heads to the vending machines

114
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,333
on the seventh floor.

115
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,500
Is anything not
an emergency?

116
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,958
I'm sorry. I know
sometimes it's not,

117
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,541
but this one counts for sure.

118
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,750
Better play it safe. I'll take
the far stairs back to eight.

119
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,750
I don't believe it...!
A metal Oopa!

120
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,125
And that's good?

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,541
You bet it is!

122
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,125
Should be safe now...

123
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

124
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,625
Ku... Kurisu...

125
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,041
Um... have we met before?

126
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,791
No... This is too much...

127
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,958
I don't... think
I know you... do I?

128
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,041
Kurisu...

129
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:06,583
Look, whoever--

130
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,083
What is your trauma...?

131
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,833
Don't rush to help me
or anything...

132
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,291
I, uh...

133
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,458
I'm just... Here to see...

134
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,041
Your attention, please.

135
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,083
Doctor Nakabachi's
conference is about

136
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,791
to begin in the 8th
floor lecture hall.

137
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,375
All interested are welcome.

138
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,166
At least finish a sentence!

139
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,833
Printed on the handouts
there in front of you

140
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,416
is more or less the
hard blueprint

141
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,791
for one of mankind's
oldest ambitions...

142
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,166
Of course,

143
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,875
the theoretical scaffolding
begs some explanation.

144
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,250
As I'm sure you're aware,

145
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
mainstream science currently
boasts something like

146
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,125
In the brief I was given,

147
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,750
they said you'd be able to pick
her out instantly. Is that true?

148
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,750
Yeah.

149
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,375
Right. Bear in mind, though...

150
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,666
It's probably a bad idea
to take her off site.

151
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,166
We don't know who
kills her or why.

152
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,458
And in the event
that her death

153
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,958
is a fixed point
on the timeline,

154
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,916
we don't want things
getting more complicated.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,916
I learned that the
hard way with Mayuri.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,458
Doctor!

157
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,916
Save your questions...

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,458
I have none, sir...!

159
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,875
I throw down the gauntlet as
to your "theory's" authorship!

160
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,083
Do you take us all for
babes in the wilderness...?!

161
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,250
Please! World lines?
Kerr Black Holes...?

162
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,125
Any moment now, this is
where she'll end up...

163
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,916
What on earth
am I going to do?

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,375
Wait! What if she's
killed somewhere else

165
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,583
and dragged here...?

166
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,708
Damn it! I hadn't
thought of that!

167
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,541
There she is...

168
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,166
This is where it happens...

169
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,500
What is that she's reading...?
Time machines...?!

170
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:51,916
Is that why so much
is riding on this?

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,791
Stupid kids...

172
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,291
What in the hell
do you want?

173
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,500
Look, please... I just want
you to read this... 'kay Dad?

174
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,833
"Dad?!"

175
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,250
Nakabachi's her dad?!

176
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:10,666
Look, I... I'm just trying
to bury the hatchet...

177
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,833
It's been years...
Too damn long...

178
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,916
I want you in my life again.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,583
Don't tell me her
father's the one who...!

180
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,708
I put on my thinking cap,
as you like to say, and well...

181
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,250
I'm now convinced that
you were right all along.

182
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,416
I wanted your opinion
on the theory.

183
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,125
If this paper gets accepted...

184
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,750
you can lord it over
all the stuffed shirts

185
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,666
who laughed you out
of the academy.

186
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,333
I did not get "laughed out!"...

187
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,166
I turned my back
on their politics

188
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,750
to pursue my
researches unfettered!

189
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,208
Sorry...

190
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,041
This isn't half bad.

191
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,291
Really?! 'Cause I was
thinking, maybe,

192
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,500
if you were okay
with the idea,

193
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,541
we could publish it under
both our names.

194
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, after all,

195
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,416
you're the one who inspired
me to write it--

196
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,541
Don't be ridiculous...
Go home.

197
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,166
What?

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,375
If this paper sees the light of
day, it'll do so under my name.

199
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,833
Excuse me?! That's
called stealing!

200
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,250
I knew you could be cruel, but
I never thought you'd stoop to--

201
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,208
Shut up!

202
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:12,250
You dare call me a thief?!

203
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,166
Bitch! What makes you think
you're so much better than me?!

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,000
A daughter's got no goddamn
right to outshine her father!

205
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,583
Every second you're
out there whoring

206
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:21,916
to make a name for yourself,

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,125
you trample my reputation
as a genius of the age!

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,458
You were my heckler,
weren't you...?

209
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,208
Heh... I see... You were in
cahoots to make nattering

210
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,541
ol' Nakabachi shit the bed

211
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:44,125
during what should've been
his moment of glory...

212
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,375
Well, You succeeded.

213
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,833
But success comes at
a price.

214
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,416
Dad, no!

215
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,833
Stand your ground;
protect her!

216
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,458
Where's your heckling now...?
Come on, let's hear it!

217
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,291
Son of bitch...

218
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,291
Dad, this is crazy...!
Please stop!

219
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,875
So I'm crazy...?! I'll show
you crazy!!!

220
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,000
Look out!

221
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,583
You're an idiot...
A DNA fluke...!

222
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,166
You're not as smart as me...!

223
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,833
My name belongs in the annals
of history... You're nothing!

224
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,000
Daddy, please...

225
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,416
If it hadn't been for you...

226
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,875
I wouldn't be the academic
laughing stock I am now!

227
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,833
Stop!!!

228
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,583
Oh god...

229
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,375
Oh my god...!

230
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,375
Look at that... Poetic
justice all around, I'd say.

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,875
I'm sorry... I didn't mean...

232
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,833
What...?

233
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,791
I didn't mean to
drag you into this...

234
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,625
I just wanted him to...
To acknowledge me...

235
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,416
Kurisu...

236
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:35,708
I'm so scared. I... I... don't
want to die... I'm not ready...

237
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:41,583
This wasn't...
wasn't supposed to...

238
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,375
No... oh god...

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,333
Please no!

240
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,041
Neat-o! They're already back!

241
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,708
Okarin!

242
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,208
Whoa. Dude...! What the
hell happened to you?!

243
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,375
He's gonna be alright...

244
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,041
It's, just... a little
bit complicated...

245
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,791
I'm responsible for
her death...

246
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,041
I'm responsible for her death...
I'm responsible for her death...

247
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,250
I'm responsible for her death...
I'm responsible for her death...

248
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:30,625
Okarin...

249
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:31,750
Walk it off...

250
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:32,875
Look, I know you're in shock,

251
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:33,958
but you've got to
pick yourself up...

252
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,125
We've got enough
fuel for one more trip

253
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,250
and now we know how
things play out, so--

254
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,208
No! I won't do it...!

255
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,625
I won't put myself
through that again!

256
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,625
Whatever I do,
Kurisu will always die...

257
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,750
Okarin, it's your phone.

258
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:51,875
A text?

259
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:52,750
Open it.

260
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,583
I shouldn't...

261
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:54,750
Just do it.

262
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,250
It says to turn on the news.

263
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,750
Seriously?

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,541
Despite the cargo bay fire,

265
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,083
Dr. Nakabachi's plane
managed to land safely

266
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,958
within the borders of
the former Soviet Union,

267
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,625
to which he'd recently defected.

268
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,291
Fate was certainly
smiling on me...

269
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,541
If this guy hadn't set off
the onboard metal detectors...

270
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,000
My thesis would've
been barbequed.

271
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,833
That's my metal oopa!
I know it is...! See look!

272
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,041
I wrote my name on the side

273
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,833
right after Okarin
bought it for me!

274
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,083
No, I see. It's just,
why's it in Russia?

275
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,375
That thesis of his...

276
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,875
That's what starts
World War Three.

277
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,541
It basically
sparks an arms race,

278
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:40,666
only the goal is which country
can build a time machine first.

279
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,708
Take first place
and win the world...

280
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,791
That's how it starts, but things
get hostile pretty quick...

281
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,125
Then war... Then people are
getting killed in droves.

282
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,333
The lives of 5.7 billion
people are at stake here...

283
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:58,666
Save Makise Kurisu... and
you save every one of them.

284
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,583
I can't do it.

285
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,916
Things'll end up just
as they did with Mayuri.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
No matter what
I did, she died...

287
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,916
There's no point...
It's all the same.

288
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
No! You only tried once!
You can't say that!

289
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:15,416
Once?! ...Are you mad?
I tried dozens of times!

290
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,041
And every time, I failed!

291
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,791
Believe me, I know...

292
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,916
You may not think I do, but
I know how cruel time can be...

293
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,125
We like to imagine we can
bend it to suit us, but...

294
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,916
This was bound to happen.

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,333
It was stupid of me to play
along... I'm sorry, but...

296
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:42,750
I'm... I'm just done...
Let time have it's way.

297
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,291
Since when have you
been the type of person

298
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,291
who's "just done"?

299
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,083
You're not fooling me.

300
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,583
You've never given up
on anything, ever...

301
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,666
Remember when I couldn't bring
myself to say bye to grandma...?

302
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,000
You went to her
grave every day for me

303
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,875
until I was ready
to do it myself.

304
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,916
You never got mad
and you never quit...

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,666
And because of that I was
finally able to let her go.

306
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,208
So, no... I'm not letting
you throw in the towel.

307
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,208
Listen, a video file
should've turned up

308
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,666
in your inbox on July 28th.

309
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,333
That's right... I'd forgotten...

310
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,791
It should be viewable now...

311
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,666
You had to fail saving her
once before it would unlock,

312
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,916
so to speak.

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,541
What the hell are you
talking about?!

314
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:38,708
I apologize...

315
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,583
I know it was a lot
to put you through,

316
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,000
but things had to be this way...

317
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,708
The whole point was
for you to see that file.

318
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,250
Is that...?

319
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,291
Hale and well met...
Old friend.

320
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,750
Is that you?!

321
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,333
That you're able to
open this means

322
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,541
you've seen firsthand
what became of Makise

323
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:09,250
and failed to prevent it.
I feel for you. I really do.

324
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,583
That said, the pain you're going
through right now is necessary.

325
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,125
I daren't deny you-- us--

326
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,041
the bitter inspiration
it represents.

327
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:22,166
Without it, you cannot hope
to carve out your destiny.

328
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,958
Now we can marshal our
resources properly.

329
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,291
I hereby charge you with the
task of reaching Stein's Gate...

330
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,250
To do so, two conditions
are absolutely essential:

331
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:36,500
one, you must destroy
Nakabachi's ill-gotten

332
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,875
time travel thesis before it
crosses into Russia's borders...

333
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:44,208
Second, you must
rescue our beloved Kurisu.

334
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,708
But how?! I've tried--

335
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,083
I'm fully aware
that the grisly nature

336
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,041
of her death appears be set
in stone due to its position

337
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:55,750
within the so-called alpha
attractor field. However...

338
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,750
I'll just come right out with
it: it is possible to save her.

339
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,000
You're simply going
about it the wrong way.

340
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:06,041
Listen carefully: you must
not--I repeat, not--

341
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,208
alter any detail surrounding
her death as witnessed by you.

342
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,791
That is, the version of
yourself prior to the botched

343
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,375
rescue attempt that allowed you
to view this video file...

344
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,666
To do so would alter the
past too drastically.

345
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,083
Think of your experiences
immediately following

346
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,375
the first D-mail:

347
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,583
the three weeks you spent
jumping through time

348
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,875
were instigated by that text.

349
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,250
It's what gave you
a history with her...

350
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,541
Your desperate, bitterly
ineffective bids to save Mayuri.

351
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:35,041
The countless sacrifices...
The terrible Rubicons crossed.

352
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:39,666
All of that must
stay in your head.

353
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,541
The period spent adrift in time
constitutes your unique reality.

354
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,625
It must not be distorted.

355
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,583
To do so would be tantamount
to a betrayal of who you are.

356
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,250
I know that to label Kurisu's
death as traumatic is

357
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,666
the epitome of understatement.
Believe me, I do.

358
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,583
The memory of seeing her
life ebb away as I held her

359
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,750
in my arms haunts me still.

360
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,708
But the pain it wrought can be
wrought in turn to greater ends.

361
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,333
It what's brings you
to yourself.

362
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,000
So trick yourself.

363
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,625
Save her without changing the
apparent fact of her death.

364
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,500
Convince your past self that
she's well and truly dead,

365
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,958
even though she lives.

366
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,000
Keep the past to all intents
and purposes where it is.

367
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:25,666
That's what will get
us to Stein's Gate.

368
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,250
Of course...!

369
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,625
I don't think I get it.

370
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,250
That goes for both of us.

371
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,041
I've every faith
that you understand.

372
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,458
Incidentally, the time
machine's model is Type C204.

373
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:41,125
I doubt I need tell you
what the C stands for.

374
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,000
It's for Christina...

375
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,333
The target world line's
charming little nickname

376
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,750
comes care of me as well;

377
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,708
which is to say,
it comes from you.

378
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,750
Care to guess its significance?

379
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:54,666
There's none

380
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,583
Bingo.

381
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,875
There's none.

382
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,958
And to further
please our whimsy...

383
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:05,583
Operation Skuld will be the
name we assign to this mission.

384
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,750
Forge of yesterday whatever
you must to save the future...

385
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,125
without detectably altering the
past as you understood them.

386
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,250
Okabe Rintarou sees Makise
lying dead on the ground

387
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,125
in a pool of her
own blood.

388
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,791
Keep the past, for all intents
and purposes, where it is.

389
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:24,291
Deceive yourself in every last
detail... Deceive the world.

390
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:28,166
Do this, and victory
is assured.

391
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:36,208
Best of luck to you, old
friend. El... Psy... Congroo.

392
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,416
Okay. Trippy...

393
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,250
You have any idea what your
future self is tellin' you?

394
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,666
Oh wow... You get
really suave.

395
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,833
"Operation Skuld..."
"El Psy Congroo..."

396
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,833
Do I never grow out of the
cloak and dagger act?

397
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:08,208
I'll be as barking mad
then as I am now.

398
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,791
Yeah, but is that so bad?...

399
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:12,000
Ah to hell with it...

400
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,541
If Stein's Gate so decrees, then
so am I compelled to behave.

401
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,083
Hououin Kyouma accepts
the challenge...!

402
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,583
With gusto!

403
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,875
Deception is my forte...
Let the world beware!

404
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:31,625
Oh ho. I think the Okabe we
all know and love is back...

405
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,833
Uh-huh... Good thing, too...

406
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:36,458
The Okarin who just broods
all day isn't nearly as fun.

407
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,541
Hear me...
privileged companions...

408
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:44,708
Time is ours... Hououin Kyouma's
mind recognizes no limit...

409
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,916
Neither does his reach!

410
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,333
Heave anchor...!

411
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,958
This ship of fools
is about to embark!
