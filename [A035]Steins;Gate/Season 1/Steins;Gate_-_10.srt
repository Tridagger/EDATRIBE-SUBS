1
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:11,208
How...? What in the...?!

2
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,458
All traces of moe
culture have vanished

3
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,250
from the streets
of Akihabara?!

4
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,583
Please, Okarin! Wait for us!

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,458
The hell, dude...?
I'm a hacker... not a hiker...

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,166
Where'd Toranoana and
Animate go, huh...?!

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,125
Where're Mandarake
and Gamers?!

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,666
Now you're just being silly.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,375
You know we don't have
any of those around here.

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,833
That's why I gotta go all the
way to Nakano for my doujin--

11
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:32,208
Wait a sec...!

12
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,791
You still work part-time
at Queen May's, don't you?!

13
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,125
Huh? What's a Queen May's?

14
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,333
Our favorite maid café!

15
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:43,375
Impossible...

16
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,791
It's quite alright, actually.

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:47,125
Moe culture thrives here
mostly because of my influence.

18
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,000
So it's a compliment.

19
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:52,458
Did she send a D-mail
back in time to undo that?

20
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,916
An entire city... rewritten by
a mere text message...!

21
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,458
Hard to believe May Queen
Nyan-Nyan is no more...

22
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,375
May Queen's a
type of potato, dude.

23
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,083
Not feeling it as the
name of a maid café...

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,125
What are you,
some tuber savant?

25
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,291
Wait, if Queen May's
never existed...

26
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,250
then how did we
first meet Faris?

27
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,583
You can mock my random
bits of trivia all you want,

28
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,625
but we wouldn't be
friends with Faris right now

29
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,000
if it weren't for the spuds.

30
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,125
Dare I even ask?

31
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,708
How'd you forget...?!

32
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,708
I was gonna kick some ass in the
Rai-Net tourney in Ikebukuro,

33
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,625
but some bad potato ramen
was all "No--not yours,"

34
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,625
and I had to skip it.

35
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,958
Go on.

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,166
So you and Mayuri filled
in for me against Faris...

37
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,250
Got both of your asses kicked,
in case you forgot that...

38
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,166
But the girls've been friends
ever since, so good times...

39
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,916
Hell, a little food poisoning
was worth the scenery.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,625
Interesting...

41
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:33,750
Check it out, Ruka...!

42
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:34,958
It's a photo-book full

43
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,958
of professional cosplay
I bought in Nakano!

44
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,500
Oh wow...! They're so adorable!

45
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,250
So even though the past has
been substantially altered,

46
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,166
our relationships are
essentially the same...

47
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,541
Yeah? Me, too!

48
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,583
If only I could get you
to coo over schematics

49
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,166
the way you do over cosplay.

50
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,666
Oh...! Afternoon, Okabe!

51
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,458
It's super-cute, don'tcha think?

52
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:53,875
Whoa...!

53
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:54,583
Huh...?

54
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,375
Sedona...

55
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,750
So much detail!

56
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,000
And there's a
swimsuit version, too!

57
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,500
I wish I could wear that...

58
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,791
But I'm so not curvy
enough to pull it off well.

59
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:04,833
Don't you worry!

60
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,500
Small boobies
will have their day!

61
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,083
Hey! We should all
take a field-trip

62
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,041
to the beach some weekend!

63
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,833
You gotta come, Kurisu!

64
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,750
School swimsuits for the win...!

65
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,500
I dunno... Us and
the perv brigade?

66
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,500
Aww...

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,916
Hey! I'm not
saying we can't go--

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,500
if we make it a girls-only trip,

69
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,208
then I'm totally down for
some beachside fun in the sun!

70
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,291
Hahaha!
Abandon this charade, Christina!

71
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
In truth, you
don't want us along

72
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,916
because we might see
the unfortunate birthmark

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,375
marring your
hindquarters... Right?

74
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,541
What?! I don't have a birthmark!

75
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,375
Besides... if this
outing to the beach

76
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,708
were really girls-only, that
would leave Rukako high and dry.

77
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,083
Huh...? How so?

78
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,625
As I pointed out
the other day...

79
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,583
Ruka is, shall we say,
of the masculine persuasion.

80
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,833
Huh?

81
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,208
What the hell's
wrong with you...?

82
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,583
Calling her a boy is a
pretty shitty thing to do.

83
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,916
It makes me sad when you
say mean stuff like that...

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,041
Dude... Not cool.

85
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,666
Wait, why're you crying...?!
Oh, honestly!

86
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
You troglodyte...!
Apologize to Ruka right now!

87
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,875
Why should I apologize

88
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,208
for saying what is
clearly the truth?!

89
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,916
No--it's fine!

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,625
You shouldn't
have to apologize...

91
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,833
If that's the way that
you think of me, so be it.

92
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,083
Well naturally it is!

93
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,041
What else am
I supposed to think?

94
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,541
Put a sock in it,
you jackass!

95
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,125
I should go! I'm sorry!

96
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,541
No y'don't!

97
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:33,750
This has gone on long enough...!

98
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,000
If Ruka's really the
girl you say she is...

99
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,708
then why does she have a--!

100
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:42,750
Uh...What the hell?

101
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,666
No, stop!... Please...! Okabe!

102
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:52,041
Rukako... You're... a female...?

103
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:56,958
That's what we've... been
saying... this whole damn time!

104
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,416
You look thrashed.
Everything okay?

105
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,458
A little torture. Nothing a
new pair of legs won't fix...

106
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,125
Tortured...?! I bet it
was that Makise chick!

107
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:12,291
Yeah... But I... got it all
cleared up... I think...?

108
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,666
What did she
do to your legs?!

109
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,208
Huh?! Sweet heavens
no--don't touch them!

110
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,041
She compelled
me to sit stock still

111
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,750
on my haunches
for a full hour...!

112
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:24,666
Lesser men would have
broken... but not me.

113
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,000
I dunno...

114
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,291
That seems pretty darn
low on the torture-ometer.

115
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,291
Is that so...?

116
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,875
You sound alarmingly
like a woman

117
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,541
who knows what
she's talking about.

118
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,750
Let's just say that
I've done my time.

119
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:44,625
This is absolutely perfect
weather to go biking.

120
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,166
I suppose.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,791
Hey... you feel
like going for a ride?

122
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:04,375
I did assume... you had,
a... second bike...!

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,625
So... I didn't come to
Tokyo to work in a TV shop...

124
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm looking for my dad.

125
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,208
Why is that...? Did he
run off or something?

126
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,416
It's been years...

127
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,041
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

128
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,208
He's somewhere in the city

129
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,166
but that's all
I really have to go on...

130
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,083
It's not much of
a smoking gun...

131
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,708
but I have an old pin of his.

132
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,166
You might want to
think about dropping

133
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,208
the part-time job
and focusing all on this.

134
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,875
Look, I... can't tell
you why exactly...

135
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,833
but I'm only gonna have
one last chance to see him.

136
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,666
Huh?

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,916
Short version?

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,958
I think my dad's gonna
be somewhere tomorrow.

139
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,541
But if I show up and
he doesn't, that's it...

140
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,500
I gotta move on,
either way.

141
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,833
There's a place I gotta
be getting to pretty soon...

142
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,083
'Cause y'know...
I'm a busy girl.

143
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,000
Hell, if I don't find
him in Tokyo...

144
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:59,375
I might as well quit looking.

145
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:06,166
You are ill at ease.
And I... find I can relate.

146
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,833
However...!

147
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,250
You just made the
serendipitous error

148
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:15,541
of disclosing your tale of
paternal woe to a mad scientist!

149
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,958
Henceforth! You are
Lab Member Double-0 Eight!

150
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,875
Resign yourself to being
our newest guinea pig!

151
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,666
What are you gonna do to me?

152
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,583
Alter your past, of course...

153
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,250
It's all part of
my master plan...

154
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,291
Helping you is
just a side-effect...

155
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,291
You will send a D-mail to
your father, understood?

156
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,333
In it, you will tell him
not to leave--and presto...!

157
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,666
Home he shall remain!

158
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,458
You're a nice guy,
you know that?

159
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,208
What?!

160
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,708
Either way...

161
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,000
I feel a little bit better
about this than I did earlier.

162
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,083
Guess I should
get back to work...

163
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:56,166
Thanks for being a pal, Okabe!

164
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,166
Hey, listen, I want you to
promise me you'll come

165
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,833
to the lab tomorrow whether
you meet your father or not...!

166
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,291
If he's not there, we'll help
you... for science, of course!

167
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,166
For all your world-dom talk...
you're just a big ol' softie!

168
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,916
All right...

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
I will now summarize

170
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,750
the basics of Operation
Eldhrimnir in layman's terms.

171
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,500
What's with the Norse mythology?

172
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,625
If Suzuha locates her father,

173
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,166
we'll have a farewell banquet...

174
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,916
We'll have dinner if she doesn't
find her father, as well...

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,666
But we'll present it as a
kind of consolation send-off...

176
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,791
If so, the D-mail
will be dessert.

177
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh oh... Who's gonna
tell Daru the plan?

178
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,666
He's off meeting
his online friends,

179
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,166
or some such nonsense...

180
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,000
But never fear,
I've got his number...!

181
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,708
This is how you hook a Daru.

182
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:53,041
I took the liberty of sending
him a little white lie.

183
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,416
Wait, are you bribing
him with food or Faris...?

184
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,375
Either way,
that'll probably work.

185
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:00,666
Huh...? But Faris told me
she couldn't be here tonight.

186
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,375
Which I'm willing
to look beyond,

187
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,666
since she's never
met Suzuha, but our

188
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,500
resident hack's attendance
is decidedly mandatory.

189
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,041
Um, actually...

190
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:13,000
I've never met her, either.
Is it okay that I'm coming?

191
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,416
But of course...!

192
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,291
You ladies can do the
shopping for our little soiree.

193
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,500
While you...?

194
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,458
While I tail the
scrappy part-timer

195
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,291
to see if her errant
parent "pops" up.

196
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,708
Aw, come on...

197
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:26,291
Don't go spying on their
father-daughter bonding time.

198
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,708
Yeah, Okarin...!

199
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,708
Why don't you just come on
our shopping trip with us!

200
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,750
Following Suzuha is my--

201
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,625
It's not gonna
happen, so drop it!

202
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:36,208
Where does my assistant get
off telling me what to do...?!

203
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,791
You remember earlier, right...?

204
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,958
How 'bout three hours?

205
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:41,833
All right...! Shopping it is!

206
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,666
So shall we be off...?!

207
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,583
Is something the
matter, Okarin?

208
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,166
It's nothing...

209
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,583
What in the...?

210
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,500
Do you think we should
go with the mild curry...?

211
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,041
Oh but, hot is so good.

212
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,041
Which do you
think she'll like?

213
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,083
Whatever is fine...
Let's go with the hot one.

214
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,250
Hmm... Good idea! 'Cause
Suzuha's a pretty spicy girl!

215
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,166
I betcha she can't even
taste the mild stuff!

216
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,375
Okie-doke...
Next stop, the meat aisle!

217
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,833
Wow!

218
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,625
Lookit these prices--they're
sure proud of their stuff!

219
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,875
Hey, Okarin...

220
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,625
You've been so
quiet all night...

221
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,208
I keep waiting for you
to say something like...

222
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,125
"Looks like the Organization's
been messing around

223
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,791
with the price
of local meat...!

224
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,458
Launching Operation
Half-Off Sales Event!"...

225
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,208
Or something like that.

226
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,916
"Operation Half-Off Sales
Event" lacks in Nordic flare.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,375
It's me... They've
sabotaged the beef supply...

228
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,541
Operation Audumbla
is still viable,

229
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,416
albeit at a greater cost.

230
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,208
Unlock additional culinary
funding on the double.

231
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,416
Huh? Look...!
First star of the night!

232
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,750
Oh that's Venus, actually.

233
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,875
Hey, Okarin.

234
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,166
Remember back when
we were little kids...

235
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,541
and you had that
really bad fever?

236
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,250
Yeah... Right when everyone
was losing their head

237
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,833
over the whole Y2K thing.

238
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:38,833
I was scared...

239
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,791
You looked so sick and frail,

240
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,708
I thought you were
gonna just fade away...

241
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,583
I didn't want you to die.

242
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,375
So I looked up at the
stars, and said a prayer.

243
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:54,375
And right then... one went
shooting past right above me.

244
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,208
So, as it went I said...

245
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:00,291
"Don't take my Okarin!"... I
said it three times in a row...

246
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,041
And the very next morning...

247
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,583
your fever had broken and you
said you were feeling better!

248
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:06,666
I don't mean to brag,

249
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,291
but I kinda saved
your life, y'know.

250
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,000
Sorry, but... you didn't...

251
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,625
My surviving that fever was
the decision of Stein's Gate.

252
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,833
Yeah...? Aw... That's no fun.

253
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,125
I'm afraid so.

254
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,791
Okay... Hey, remember
when you first got sick,

255
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:28,541
how you fell down?
Remember what you said?

256
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,625
You said you were dizzy,

257
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,458
and that the
world felt all wiggly...

258
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,333
Like you'd been zapped
by lightning, you told me...

259
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,208
Like things didn't
make sense anymore.

260
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,791
When we were back at Faris's...?

261
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,583
Your face reminded
me of then.

262
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,708
Sick in bed with that fever...

263
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,083
I'd forgotten how that felt...

264
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:51,500
It's the same way I feel
when I shift world-lines...

265
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,625
I wonder... was
that bout of illness...

266
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,916
the emergence of my
Reading Steiner ability...?

267
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,333
Hey!

268
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,875
Hey, you two!

269
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,583
Huh...? What's that
odor assailing my nose?

270
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,208
Oh, that? Kurisu decided to
make an apple pie for us...

271
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,708
That stench is dessert?!

272
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,541
I'd love to help...
you have a job for me?

273
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,666
Sure! Why don't you
boil some eggs for me.

274
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,125
Okay!

275
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,375
Let's see... Ooh!

276
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,375
I'll just pop 'em
into the Phone Wave!

277
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,625
No, Mayuri--don't!
They'll explode in there!

278
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,708
I can take care of it!

279
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:28,791
Aww...

280
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,833
You can chop the
mushrooms instead, yeah?

281
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,166
Yaaaay!

282
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Wait a second...!

283
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,958
What manner of Stygian dessert
are you trying to foist upon us?

284
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,833
They're for the salad, genius.

285
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,083
I defy you to find
me a single world-line

286
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:41,375
in which egg and mushroom
salad goes with apple pie!

287
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,208
Chop...! Chop...! Chop!

288
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,208
I'm calling a moratorium
on the "chop chop chop!"

289
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:46,958
Outta the way!

290
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,125
Woe betide me...

291
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,000
All the women have turned
into evil kitchen ghouls...

292
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,125
If I don't call you back
in an hour's time, please...

293
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,750
tell my parents
that I loved them...

294
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,000
right up until
the bitter... end.

295
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,750
'Scuse me, Okabe. Is there
a rice cooker in here?

296
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,291
Heeeere's Daru...!
Wait a sec, where's Faris?

297
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,791
Sorry... She can't make
it to our dinner tonight...

298
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,500
looks like someone pulled a
fast one on you--guess who.

299
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:16,166
What...?! Son-of-a...!
Man, you suck!

300
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,500
Y'know, truth is a very
subjective phenomenon.

301
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,916
Fat load of good that does me!

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,750
I skipped my time-travel
meet-up for this!

303
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,125
Time-travel meet-up?

304
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,458
Don't judge.

305
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,166
It's just a bunch of posters
from a sci-fi forum

306
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,416
I moderate sometimes...

307
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,166
We had a writer coming
as a guest tonight, too!

308
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,291
This little kit is so cute!
What do you keep in here?

309
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:36,500
I wouldn't go
touching that, Ruka!

310
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,833
It's Future Gadget
numero four: Moad Snake!

311
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:39,708
Is that a Claymore?!

312
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,291
No, no, it's merely a mock-up...

313
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,875
In actuality, it's a humidifier.

314
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,833
Aha! Here we go!

315
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
No--don't pull that!

316
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,666
I'm so sorry, you guys...

317
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,583
What's done is done.

318
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,958
Just watch what you touch
from now on, all right?

319
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,125
Hey... This might
help with the clean-up.

320
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:09,000
A vacuum? Yeah, good thinking.

321
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,000
Guess again...!

322
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,500
It's Future Gadget
number three...!

323
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:13,375
Or is it the second one?

324
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,541
Number Five. A.K.A.

325
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:19,333
"'I've Connected Yet Another
Trifling Thing,' a la Goemon."

326
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:22,375
A.K.A. a hair dryer
that uses the heat output

327
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,583
of a vacuum cleaner...
Here, gimme.

328
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,666
Hold on!

329
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,000
You have to
unplug everything else

330
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,666
before you use it,
otherwise the--!

331
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,041
...breaker will trip.

332
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,250
Yeah... Anybody know
where the flashlight is?

333
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,791
Um... is this it...?

334
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,041
Uh... no... That's a cucumber.

335
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,416
So... where's the fuse-box...?

336
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,583
What's with that giggle, Mayuri?

337
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,416
You're just going to
trip over something!

338
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,666
Told you so.

339
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,541
Oww...

340
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,000
It's by the front door.

341
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,791
Cool. Thanks.

342
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,500
You okay?

343
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,208
What's so funny?

344
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,333
Sorry 'bout that...
It's just...

345
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,750
Hmm?

346
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:10,750
I thought of the lab
I work at back in America...

347
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,333
It's top-notch, y'know?

348
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:15,458
We're talking wall
to wall geniuses...

349
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,958
But they're all so... cold...

350
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:23,041
Scientifically, it blows this
place out of the water, but...

351
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,000
I feel at home here.

352
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,458
Hey!

353
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,958
Don't go thinking that was
a compliment or anything...!

354
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,500
I was just comparing and
contrasting the labs...

355
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,791
That's all...

356
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:37,000
I made this place because
I couldn't invent friends.

357
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:47,125
It worked... I mean...
I'm still here, aren't I?

358
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,458
And you know earlier...

359
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,375
when you said you cherish
our friendship, it...

360
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:56,583
well... it made me
happy... Like, a lot.

361
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,791
Did you fall on your head?

362
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,250
Wait, what...?!

363
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,833
I try to say something nice,
and that's your reply...?!

364
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,000
You're such a bastard!

365
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,875
Suzuha sure is late, huh.

366
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,166
I hope that means
she found her dad.

367
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,541
Sure, I bet
they're catching up

368
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,625
on father/daughter stuff
and they lost track of time.

369
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,666
I made it very clear she was to
report to the lab either way...

370
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,791
But I guess my instructions
were all for nothing.

371
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:39,000
She isn't coming.
Let's call it a night.

372
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,041
Why, that little...!

373
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,875
So she's going to
slink off into the night,

374
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,625
fatherless and alone...?

375
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,458
Not on my watch. Hououin
Kyouma cannot abide this!

376
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,416
Dammit!

377
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,416
Where could she be?!

378
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,708
Of course...

379
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,458
I'll send a D-mail
instructing myself

380
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:28,625
to tail Suzuha this afternoon
at all costs...! But...

381
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,041
After everything
that's transpired...

382
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,875
dare I alter the
past any further...?

383
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,875
You're a nice guy,
you know that?

384
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,375
Either way...

385
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,375
I feel a little bit better
about this than I did earlier.

386
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
I'm no thumb
twiddling milquetoast

387
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,666
trembling in his lab coat...
I am Hououin Kyouma...

388
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,750
I look into the
abyss with nary a fear!

389
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,208
"Ignore assistant..."

390
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,666
"...tail Suzuha!"

391
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,166
Whassup.

392
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
It's good to see
you're so hard at work...

393
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,750
Late night, eh?

394
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,125
No kidding--that party really
took on a life of its own!

395
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,708
I'm running on fumes today...

396
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,166
Humor me, if you would...

397
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,083
We threw a consolation
dinner for you last night,

398
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,416
one at which you served
as our test subject.

399
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
Did we not?

400
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,916
Yeah, but we never got
around to the guinea pig part,

401
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,166
'cause I don't have
my dad's contact info.

402
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,083
There's a detail
I'm kind of fuzzy on...

403
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,708
Refresh my memory as to how you
ended up at the lab last night?

404
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,583
Huh...? What were
you drinking...?

405
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,833
Sounds like somebody
needs to lay off the sauce.

406
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,208
Please, just indulge
me for a moment.

407
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,750
Yeah, okay...

408
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,375
I was just leaving the time-
travel forum meet-up when you--

409
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,291
Uh... Time-travel
forum meet-up...?!

410
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,083
When you told me your father
might show up somewhere,

411
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,708
is that what you meant?!

412
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,250
Yup. On the message boards,

413
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,708
he posts under
the user ID Titor.

414
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,333
Wait... John Titor?!

415
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,833
Nuh uh, sorry.
Barrel... It's Barrel Titor.

416
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,958
I told you at
the party, remember?

417
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,208
You recorded me
saying it and everything.

418
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,708
Oh man...! Last night
was so much fun!

419
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,750
Course, it would've been
better without you-know-who...

420
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,375
That pie of hers almost made it

421
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,791
a farewell party
for everyone...!

422
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,083
Ruka's curry, though...

423
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,291
now that was some tasty stuff!

424
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,333
I really do dig your lab...
Seriously cool!

425
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,791
You all get along, and
you're always having fun.

426
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:02,750
First time in my whole life
I felt like I really fit in.

427
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,125
Come on up whenever you want.

428
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,708
Surely I needn't remind you...

429
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,208
You are a member of the lab now.

430
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,541
Yeah. Maybe I'll stick around...

431
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,416
Look for dear ol'
Dad a little bit more...
