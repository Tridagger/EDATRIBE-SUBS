1
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:27,166
I'm calling a it a day--
help me lock up, yeah?

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,416
Okay!

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,708
I never said that, you liar!

4
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,041
Not in actual speech, perhaps,

5
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,000
but your eyes were begging
me to take those breaks!

6
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,333
Yeah, because you looked like

7
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,541
you were about to up and
die every couple of feet!

8
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,708
Don't be naïve--I was
merely feigning weakness!

9
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,625
What, we weren't
conspicuous enough already?!

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,875
Okabe! Wasssup!

11
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,208
What's in the box?

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,250
Heh! Dying to know, are you?

13
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,458
I'd be sworn to
secrecy most days,

14
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,500
refusing to divulge its contents
even under threat of torture--

15
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,208
My arms are on fire! Can't you
tell her what it is later?!

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,583
Oh, buck up, buttercup.

17
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,041
Fine--do it now!

18
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,791
But would you please just
skip ahead to the good part!

19
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:02,833
How could you say that...?!

20
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,625
This box is a reliquary...!

21
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,875
Its precious cargo demands
a properly-paced denouement!

22
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,125
Lemme guess, it's an IBN 5100?

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,625
What...?!

24
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,958
How did she pluck the answer
out of thin air like that?!

25
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,500
So, how'd you track it down?

26
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:17,250
Fate guided my footsteps
to Yanabayashi Shrine,

27
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,791
where it languished amid the
dusty offerings of yesteryear--!

28
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,208
Wow...!

29
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,375
Fate's gonna crush your
footsteps if we don't hurry up!

30
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,708
Makise Kurisu...?!

31
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,875
Uh...? Uh huh...?
Who is this person?

32
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:31,500
She's Mr. Braun's new
part... time... help.

33
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,166
Did I... miss... something...?

34
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,583
C'mon, kid--let me
see some hustle!

35
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,583
We're closin' up here!

36
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,125
If looks could kill,
I'd be a goner...!

37
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,166
Well, you do have a
right dastardly face.

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,416
Huh?!

39
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,833
Daru, your t-shirt is so big!

40
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,958
It's like the sail
from a pirate ship!

41
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:46,625
Or a rug...!
Made from a big polar bear!

42
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,416
Mayushi is frolicking
on my shirt...

43
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,458
She's getting her
adorable all over it!

44
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,416
Steady now! Easy does it...!

45
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,375
Thanks, Captain Obvious!

46
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,583
It's Kurisu!

47
00:03:56,666 --> 00:04:00,166
Oh hey, Mayuri... Sorry
to just barge in like this.

48
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:02,541
You can come here
whenever you like...!

49
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,666
After all, you
are a member now!

50
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,083
What happened to
never coming back, hmm?

51
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,416
Frailty, thy name is Assistant.

52
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm here 'cause you're too
weak to carry the thing...!

53
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,833
I certainly didn't
come of my own volition!

54
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:17,083
Ah, you... you don't like it
here at the Future Gadget Lab?

55
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,541
Wait, what?

56
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,625
No, I... I didn't say that.
It... it's complicated...!

57
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,250
So, what's in the mystery box?

58
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,750
You dying to know...?
I'd be sworn to secre--

59
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,500
An IBN 5100.

60
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,500
Huh...?! Come to papa...!

61
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,041
Dude, Okarin, way to go!

62
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:35,166
Seriously, this is why
we love you and follow you.

63
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,250
I don't follow him.

64
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:41,041
Uh... Anyway, let's see
if it still even boots up!

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Good thing I was talking
about it at the maid café, huh!

66
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,708
Indeed. Couldn't have
done it without you, Mayuri.

67
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,625
It works!

68
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:56,166
How long will it take you to
crack that proprietary code?

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,875
Don't hold your
breath or anything...

70
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,375
I mean, this computer
is older than I am...

71
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,333
Older than the interwebs, too...

72
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,958
which means I can't just pop
an Ethernet cable into the back.

73
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,583
This stuff an' a
gum-wrapper should do it.

74
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,958
Huh...?

75
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,791
I'll get right on it...
Assistant, you heard the man.

76
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,083
You braying it ad nauseum
doesn't make me your assistant.

77
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,125
Oh, but you are!

78
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,833
No... I'm... not!

79
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,458
Okarin, you should go.

80
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,208
She's not gonna know where all
those nutty little shops are.

81
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,250
Hhh... If I must.
Let's be off, Mayuri!

82
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,916
Nah--I think I'm
gonna stay behind

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,416
and give our new lab member
the grand tour of the place...

84
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,750
If you know where everything is,

85
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,250
maybe you'll end
up liking it more

86
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,333
and you won't wanna go away!

87
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,375
O foul enchantress!

88
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,250
Working your hoodoo
on that innocent girl!

89
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,208
Working my what?!

90
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,333
Hush. Don't fight it, Makise...

91
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,416
Give in to the
Sapphic goodness...!

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,958
Keep on dreaming, pervert!

93
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:47,083
Hey Makise, what does
"Sapphic goodness" mean?

94
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,458
Uh... how about
that tour...? Y'ready?

95
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,250
All right! Let's show her
what's behind door number one!

96
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,750
Hold on. Is that
a shower back there?

97
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,916
Uh-huh...!

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,416
But sometimes the
water gets really cold

99
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,916
if you stay in there for a
bit too long, and that's no fun!

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,375
You mean...

101
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,250
you've actually used this
shower to bathe yourself...?

102
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,833
Yeah, every once in a while!

103
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:13,333
You have to promise me you'll
never shower here again, Mayuri!

104
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:15,125
She's perfectly safe!

105
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,750
I should buy you
some pepper-spray...!

106
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:19,000
Why do you hang out with
these weirdos, anyhow?

107
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:23,750
Is it blackmail, or coercion,
or brainwashing or what?!

108
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,833
Nothing like that.
It's just I'm Okarin's hostage!

109
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:30,750
That's it--I'm calling the cops.

110
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,500
Wait!

111
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,208
She just said
she's your hostage...

112
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,625
You two are going down.

113
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,125
No, silly.

114
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,375
I wanted to be...
And so far it's super fun.

115
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,416
You'll see!

116
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,375
Huh? What...
is she talking about?

117
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,375
Hmph... Well, I'm off.

118
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,125
See ya later!

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,500
It's not the exact thing he
wanted, but I'm sure it'll do...

120
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,333
Waaaaassssup!

121
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,250
How's the ol' 5100 coming along?

122
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,250
Shh! Don't speak of it--not
even by its number!

123
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,500
Came to get some parts, huh?
Need any help?

124
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,541
I'd have never guessed

125
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,291
the part-time TV girl
knows so much about PCs.

126
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,250
Yeah, but when it comes to IBNs,

127
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,291
there's one guy who
has all of us beat.

128
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,541
Are you serious?! Put me in
touch with him, immediately!

129
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,875
I can't.

130
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,583
Do you wish for us to be
at loggerheads over this?

131
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,125
Look, it's not
up for discussion.

132
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,875
You're treading a
very dangerous path!

133
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,375
He's dead... Okay...?
That's why I can't.

134
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,125
He's been dead for years now.

135
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,416
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,416
I'm the one who should
apologize... For before.

137
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,833
Did my assistant
offend you in some way?

138
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,875
Just met her.

139
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,666
Did she glare at you, perchance?

140
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,791
Or scoff! She packs
a wicked scoff!

141
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,750
Neither one...
She hasn't done anything.

142
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,083
What, then?

143
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,291
She hasn't done anything yet...

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,416
But I promise you, she will.

145
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,208
Just be careful...
She's bad for your health.

146
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,416
What do you mean?!

147
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,458
Air raid--get down!

148
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,458
Huh...?

149
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,541
It's just a news chopper...

150
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,708
For the fireworks
display later on.

151
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,041
What a relief.
Fireworks, huh...?

152
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,208
Hey, wait I've heard of those!

153
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,625
"Heard of"...? Meaning
you've never witnessed them?

154
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,791
I wanna see 'em! Where do I go?!

155
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,666
Follow yonder road
down to the river

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,125
and you should get
a fair enough view.

157
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,333
Awesome!

158
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,666
I'll message ya...!
Just gimme me your e-mail!

159
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:40,750
A festival?

160
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:42,958
Yup! Fireworks and everything!

161
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,708
It's been so long...

162
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,083
Wanna go watch 'em?

163
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,458
Oh, uh... well... I guess...

164
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,583
Look...! There's Okarin!

165
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,333
Too-too-roo!

166
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,250
Homeward bound?

167
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,083
Mm-hm!

168
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,291
How did the parts hunt go?

169
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,041
Total success, of course...

170
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,083
Ah... So... you
guys're really gonna

171
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,875
keep working this
time machine angle, huh?

172
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:06,625
Don't tell me you care now?

173
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:08,000
You do, don't you?

174
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,458
No...! Well, maybe a
just a tiny little bit...

175
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,083
But I still think your kooky
SERN conspiracy theories

176
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,833
are nothing but
a bunch of hot air.

177
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,041
The truth. That's all
I'm interested in... okay?

178
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,041
Sorry, Mayuri.

179
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,125
Sorry?

180
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,041
I think I'm gonna
skip the fireworks

181
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,625
and go back to the lab.

182
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,041
That's okay. I should prob'ly
be heading back home, anyhow.

183
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,166
Cool.

184
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,083
But Makise...?

185
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,333
Are you gonna keep coming back?

186
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,833
Yeah... After all,

187
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,291
I'm a member until I fly
back to America, right?

188
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
Yay!

189
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,750
Night-night!

190
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,583
Why would she even
bother to ask...?

191
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,291
After all...
you are my assistant--

192
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,208
of course you're
coming back to the lab.

193
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:49,041
She told me the two of
you were childhood pals...

194
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,375
But I still don't get how
one of you turned out

195
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,250
so socially inept while
the other one's normal.

196
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,416
Yes, well, poor Mayuri always
has been a little bit different.

197
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,416
I didn't mean her, genius!

198
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,541
"Here's my first e-mail!"

199
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:07,375
"Better than I imagined!"
"Fireworks are amazing!"

200
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
So that was the last
time it worked, huh?

201
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:20,000
Ooh! Mind if I use this?

202
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,875
I love a good lab coat...
Calms me down.

203
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,166
Look at you!

204
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,083
The sight of you enveloped
in that lab coat...!

205
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,333
To the very
marrow it thrills me!

206
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,291
Uhhh... What the hell
are you going on about?!

207
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:36,333
Need you ask me...?!

208
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,208
That coat is a
pledge--a symbol!--

209
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,541
that you are a
friend to Science!

210
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,750
Stop!

211
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,791
I keep telling Daru and
Mayuri to wear one,

212
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,708
but they don't get it!

213
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,666
But not you, you understand...!

214
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,750
Ergo, I want you to jam your
hands into your coat pockets!

215
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:49,750
Huh...?!

216
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,083
Now, woman!

217
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,291
Okay! Like this?

218
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,125
Perfect! Our stance
is that of the lucky few

219
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,541
who know the privilege

220
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,041
and burden of having dedicated
their life to research!

221
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,833
It's kinda sexy...

222
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,500
...every time you wear it,
marvel anew at my generosity!

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,583
All I'm going to marvel
at is your stupidity...!

224
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,083
What are you hiding in there?

225
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,125
Shut up! I haven't
eaten since lunch,

226
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:14,291
and that was a long time ago.

227
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,708
Oh, very well...

228
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:20,041
I'm feeling generous, so dinner
will be on me this once.

229
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,041
The fruit of your labor.

230
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:21,958
Are you serious?!

231
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:22,750
You object?

232
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:23,833
You're damn right I do...!

233
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,875
Tell me there's
something else!

234
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,250
We do have a stockpile
of instant ramen...

235
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,833
But no one raised on
the windswept moors

236
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,000
of America would ever deign--

237
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:32,791
In a cup?

238
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,541
Mm-hmm.

239
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,125
I suppose that'll do.

240
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:38,666
So, what flavors do you have?

241
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,000
Salt an' soy sauce!

242
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,416
I'll have the salt... Though,
I had better use a fork.

243
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,666
No point stalling.
Time runs out, you lose anyway.

244
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,041
Wanna throw in the towel?

245
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,291
'Cause that one at the
end is clearly a virus card.

246
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,791
Just saying.

247
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,041
Hah! Whatever you think is
gonna get you through the night.

248
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,708
Oh good, thank you for making
my decision so much easier.

249
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,041
Last turn... And... go.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,416
Oho...

251
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I see you're drinking that soda
with extraordinary aplomb.

252
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:16,125
Uh... Seven years in the
States--whaddya expect?

253
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,208
We could go grab something
harder, if you're game.

254
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,333
Nah, none for me, thanks. I'm
still underage, so you know...

255
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:24,291
I was talking about
the caffeinated version

256
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,083
of what you're holding.

257
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,708
That's harder to you?

258
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,708
What purpose have I for alcohol?

259
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,291
That soda you hold is the one

260
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,541
and only drink of
the intelligentsia!

261
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,291
Uh huh your love of carbonation
is a beautiful thing--

262
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,791
now stop peeking at my cards.

263
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,166
And, that's the game, my friend.

264
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,541
No offense, but you're not
the sharpest tool in the shed

265
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,791
when it comes to looking
at the bigger picture.

266
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,666
You're so caught up in your
whole "damn the torpedoes" deal

267
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,916
that you never think about
what the other guy's doing.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,166
You got played, Okabe.

269
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,083
Sorry.

270
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,833
Hold on!

271
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,916
What'd I say...?!

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,375
You know perfectly well!

273
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,125
What, that you kind of
suck at the big picture?

274
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,500
Don't be a jerk--it's the truth.

275
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:10,833
No! Just after that...!

276
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,458
When you referred
to me as Okabe!

277
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,500
So...? What's the
matter with that...?

278
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,250
Just because you
call me Assistant,

279
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:19,958
it doesn't mean I'm going to
call you Boss-man or anything--

280
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,291
Listen!

281
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,875
For the last time, Christina...!

282
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:27,833
My name is Hououin--
I'd thank you to remember it!

283
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,708
Henceforth... you
will call me Hououin!

284
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:34,666
Or if that's too hard...
Kyouma is also, acceptable.

285
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,000
Hm? Are you crying down there?

286
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,333
What's there to cry about...?!

287
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,625
Just 'cause some maniac
jumped out of his chair

288
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,875
and started screaming at
me about his damn fake name

289
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,125
and scared me half to death? No
that's totally fine, no problem!

290
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,000
Daru... The woman is
weeping. Why is this?

291
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:59,791
Think about what she told you
in that big breathless rant.

292
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,250
Let's see...

293
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:09,166
This part should plug
into--nope. Nope... My bad...

294
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,375
So, if this is right,
then these cables

295
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,416
should shimmy on down...
through... here... Yeah...

296
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,166
Assistant...

297
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,458
No... but go ahead.

298
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,416
Maybe you should
call it a night...

299
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,541
Your hotel is nearby, right?

300
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,500
Don't worry... If it doesn't
work by morning, I'm outta here.

301
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:28,625
Shouldn't you at
least call your family?

302
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,625
Haven't seen Dad in seven years,
and Mom's in the States...

303
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,000
Trust me, no one's
waiting up for a call.

304
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,000
A genius orphan, swaddled
in your threadbare lab coat.

305
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,416
I am not "swaddled," weirdo.

306
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,250
It's alive...

307
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,625
It's aliiiiiiiiive!

308
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,625
You got it to work?!

309
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,500
Hashida Daru for another win!

310
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,708
Does any of it look helpful?

311
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,000
I haven't mucked around yet...

312
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,083
But hey, this thing
says "Z-Program"...

313
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,083
So that file was
created back in 1973?

314
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:57,875
Looks like.

315
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,333
SERN--when was it founded?

316
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,500
In the fifties--
fifty-four I think.

317
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:03,541
And this machine first
came on the market in...?!

318
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,875
Ooh, me! Nineteen seventy-five!

319
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,250
Did SERN actually smuggle

320
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,625
a whole programming
language into the 5100s

321
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,875
just to further their
covert time-travel plan?!

322
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,625
That seems like
a bit of a stretch.

323
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,250
But it is possible, right?!

324
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:16,833
How about we
just read the report

325
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,458
and then we'll
know what's up...?

326
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,916
I can't wait for it to be
something totally innocuous

327
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,708
and then you're forced to drop
this stupid conspiracy crap.

328
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:27,583
Ugh. This font is killing
my eyes...! Somebody tag in!

329
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,333
Just be glad it's not French...

330
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,916
Okay, it reads,

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,583
"The Control of Space-Time and
its Destruction of History..."

332
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,708
Oh, yeah... Everything sounds
better when you read it!

333
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:37,833
Better watch yourself...!

334
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,458
Keep whispering in
his ear like that,

335
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,208
you might join the
2D ladies in Daru's harem.

336
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah... I think not.

337
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,458
Okay, I'm skipping ahead.

338
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,083
"Creating a stable world
spanning from past to future...

339
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,083
this will be the true
raison d'être of SERN

340
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,000
as we move into
the 21st century."

341
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,875
There, you see?!
They mean to rule us!

342
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,041
You're being paranoid...

343
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,375
Tab down further.
Down past the abstract.

344
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,166
2-D girls aren't as bossy.

345
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,541
Let's see... More fluff...
List of participants...

346
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,208
C'mon, tell me what
they actually did...!

347
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:10,583
Here we go! "The Z-Program
will test the feasibility

00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,208
of space-time

350
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,416
"Of space-time...
transference..."

351
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,208
See?! That has to
mean time-travel!

352
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:20,958
No it doesn't!

353
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,375
I'm right, dammit...!

354
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,666
SERN's been conducting
clandestine time-travel research

355
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,166
for the past 40 years--
at the very least!

356
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,625
Just stop, okay?!
No jumping to conclusions!

357
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,208
"Program Phase #1:

358
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,208
Construction and utilization
of Large Hadron Collider.

359
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,583
Program Phase #2:

360
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:38,250
Practical application
and tuning of lifter."

361
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,875
Daru, what are these
"lifter" things about?

362
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,166
You remember all that
buzz about ionocrafts...?

363
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,708
Same principal, but with
a less science-y name...

364
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,458
Like this, take a look.

365
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,333
Is it floating?!

366
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:48,916
That's what happens when you run

367
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,666
a high-voltage current
through aluminum.

368
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,708
What exactly does
floating aluminum

369
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,791
have to do with time-travel?

370
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,083
I don't know,
but they're spending

371
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,625
an awful lot of time
on it, aren't they...?

372
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,541
It says this thing
requires a lifter

373
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,041
and the presence
of a black hole.

374
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,458
Keep on reading...!

375
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:04,375
"Program Phase #3 is some
kind of animal testing...

376
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,916
And Program Phase #4--

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,041
Say it!

378
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,500
"...Human testing."

379
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,208
Which brings us right up to...

380
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,041
"Human is dead- mismatch."

381
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:16,916
No.

382
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,291
We stumbled across that phrase

383
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,750
when we first
hacked our way in...

384
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,958
What did the part
after that say, again?

385
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,708
"More details to follow
in Jellyman's report."

386
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,958
Well, it's high time that
we gave it a look. I say!

387
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,833
You sure my opening this
folder is a good idea?

388
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,041
If this stuff is legit,

389
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,708
then we're all in it way
above our pay-grade!

390
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,875
Don't tell me you're
chickening out now.

391
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,375
He does have a point...

392
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,083
SERN doesn't mess around--and
if we unearth this report,

393
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,166
we'll all be privy to
their darkest secret.

394
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,583
So, what, you're
not going to read it?

395
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,750
Save yourself.

396
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,583
You've got a bright
future ahead of you...

397
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,583
Once we read this file...

398
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,750
I can't guarantee
any of our safety.

399
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,875
Hold on, is that... concern
I'm hearing in your voice?

400
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,875
Well of course it is!
You're important to...!

401
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,500
...our scientific endeavors!

402
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,958
Thanks for your concern,
but I'm not going anywhere...

403
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,375
I'd be up all night
thinking about this anyway.

404
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:10,875
So you're in,
come what may?

405
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:11,666
Oh yeah.

406
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,000
And what do you say, Daru?

407
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,291
Well I mean I have been
pretty bad-ass so far...

408
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,625
If they haven't managed
to trace my hack by now,

409
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,750
then we should be golden.

410
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,625
Very well then. We go.

411
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,958
To raid Jellyman's report
for precious intel!

412
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,000
This act will go
down in lab history

413
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,041
as Operation Laegjarn's Chest!

414
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,583
What is that,
Norse mythology?

415
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,166
Why do we need to
name it anything?

416
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,458
Just have him
open the report.

417
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,291
Daru! Fire off a broadside!

418
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,458
I'm on it.

419
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,458
More files?!

420
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,708
Hmm... Yeah...
Fourteen of 'em...

421
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,416
I'll just pick one at random.

422
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,125

426

430
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,500

fourteen of these...?

00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,083
Wanna see another?

458
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,666
I've seen quite enough...

459
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,041
You okay, man?

460
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,500
I... I need some fresh air...

461
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,875
I've never seen him
so shaken up before.

462
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,458
Why'd the test subjects
go all dessert-cup?

463
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,541
Judging from when
I've read so far...

464
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,500
I think SERN is
developing tech

465
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,875
to allow time-travel
via Kerr black holes.

466
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,666
I can only imagine
what sort of trauma

467
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,708
that would inflict upon
a living human being,

468
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,125
trying to cram it through
a singularity like that.

469
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,916
I'm not surprised that
they've all turned into mush.

470
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's like trying to squeeze this
sponge into my clenched hand...

471
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:06,125
You see?...
The insides get wrung out.

472
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,416
So basically, it's
a really tight fit?

473
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,833
Yeah.

474
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,041
You're squeezing into something
extraordinarily narrow.

475
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,625
You're making time-travel
sound pretty freaky.

476
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,416
Huh...? What's wrong
with squeezing int--

477
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,250
Daru, you're such a pervert!

478
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,666
Says the girl talking about

479
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,458
squeezing things
into tight spaces.

480
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,500
Yeah, I meant a black hole.

481
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,666
There you are.

482
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,958
Hey... Listen...
I know it's crazy...

483
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,916
But just look
at it this way.

484
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,375
Now that we're sure it's true,

485
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:45,208
we have to figure out what
our next move is gonna be

486
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,666
What'd I say?

487
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,125
Our next move is
patently obvious.

488
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,166
Huh?

489
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,291
We have Future
Gadget numero eight,

490
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,833
the Phone Wave
(Real Name TBA), do we not?

491
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,791
We... will build a
time-machine first!

492
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,250
And SERN will come to nothing,

493
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,166
because we will
rule the world instead!

494
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,291
Why did I even bother to ask?
