1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,875
We're now on day five of the
mysterious satellite incident

2
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,583
here at the downtown
Radio Building...

3
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,541
Throngs of onlookers continue
to flock in the street below

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,166
in hopes of catching
a firsthand glimpse,

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,500
and as no country has

6
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,291
yet come forward to
claim the offending object,

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,125
it's anyone's guess when life
here will return to normal.

8
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,333
Can we have a
moment of your time?

9
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,750
You're, here to get a look
at the satellite I assume, yes?

10
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,541
Could you tell our viewers at
home where you've traveled from?

11
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,625
Wowza! Are you kidding? 

12
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,083
It's awesome! 

13
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,958
This, like, your
first beef bowl?

14
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:01,375
Yep! And I gotta say: the
hype doesn't do 'em justice!

15
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,708
Yes, well, you really ought to
try it with raw egg sometime...

16
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,666
That is, of course,
once you've mastered

17
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,458
this unwarrior-like
phobia of eating out alone.

18
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,541
Daru and I only dine
together out of convenience,

19
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,083
you understand.

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,041
You're more than welcome to
join us whenever you'd like...

21
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,625
Hey! It's comin' back to me...

22
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,000
The last time we came here,

23
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,916
you totally skipped out
and left me with the check!

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,791
I do concede that as
a distinct possibility.

25
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,750
Try a distinct
damn right-ability!

26
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,583
Where're my
greenbacks, Bogart?!

27
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,750
Not the day to bark up
that tree, I'm afraid...

28
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,833
It's me.

29
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,041
Kindly make the aforementioned
monetary transfers

30
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,583
into my Swiss bank
account, if you would...

31
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,500
That one, yes...
Wait, what?

32
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:42,291
The Organization
is playing havoc...

33
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,125
Please. No. Cell-phones. 

34
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,791
Er, does it count if the
conversation's all in his head?

35
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,041
Too-too-roo!

36
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
I didn't know you were
part of the group now.

37
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,500
Oh, I was just on the
ol' lunch break, you know...

38
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,000
You'd should've
come around earlier,

39
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,583
it would have been a party.

40
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,750
I propose we do this
again tomorrow, all of us.

41
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,250
Okarin's treat. 

42
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,875
No no no. Don't put me on hold!

43
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:04,458
Crisis or not,

44
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,125
it can't take the banks a full
week to straggle back online...!

45
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,916
Cool, the gang's all here! 

46
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,541
Double-O Four.
Well-rested, I trust?

47
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,333
Don't start with
that crap again.

48
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,166
Hey. I hate to break
up your meeting...

49
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,750
but your lunch break
ended five minutes ago.

50
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,958
What's that about? 

51
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,500
Round table? 

52
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,208
Yep.

53
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,666
That like a thing...? 

54
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,750
A lab member
pow-wow, indeed.

55
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,875
You make it sound like
we do 'em all the time.

56
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:40,250
Only table I see
here is rectangular.

57
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,083
Ugh. I don't mean it literally;

58
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,000
"round table" is simply
a figure of speech;

59
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,416
meant to evoke camaraderie--

60
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,791
Thank you. I'm quite
familiar with the expression.

61
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,916
I'm just never sure whether you
mean things literally or not.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
I think it sounds sweet
even if it is rectangular.

63
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,625
Thank you... 

64
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:57,125
You're welcome...!
So let's start...

65
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,250
Who's gonna bring
the "camaraderie"?

66
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,208
Yeah, what now, chief?
You pull a sword from a stone?

67
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:04,041
I'd like to point out
that as a temporary member

68
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,458
I shouldn't be
eligible to attend.

69
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,333
Oh my goodness... Fine!

70
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,416
I grant you special
privileges... Moving on.

71
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,250
Our needs must be to apprise
Mayuri of notre dilemme.

72
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,875
Uh oh. What's that?

73
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,708
In short, my minions,
if we intend

74
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,291
to nip SERN's odious design
in the proverbial bud,

75
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,541
perfecting the Phone
Wave (Real Name TBA)'s

76
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,250
incipient functionality
is absolutely paramount.

77
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,708
Awww, you use so many big words

78
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,833
the little ones around them
don't make sense either.

79
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,291
Let me put it this way then,
SERN is very, very bad.

80
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:42,708
'Kay, but what do you mean
by perfecting it, though?

81
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,291
I mean...

82
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,875
We already sent texts back in
time, what else do you think--?

83
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:48,250
True, but in point of fact,
we've only done so twice!

84
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,875
Flying blind, I might add. No.
We have to look for patterns.

85
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:54,958
Well then, we know
from the last experiment

86
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:57,916
it only seems to work when
there's an electrical discharge.

87
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,208
Eureka! 

88
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,500
Flash of inspiration? 

89
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,541
No, it's just that "Mail From
the Past" is too inelegant...

90
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:08,375
If we expect to be inspired
we must first christen

91
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,875
the phenomena
with a decent name.

92
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,916
How 'bout...
Cart before the horse?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,291
Not helpful!
Continue to mock me,

94
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,000
and my wrath shall
hamme--

95
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,541
Please.

96
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,875
You'd get sidetracked thinking
up a name for a screwdriver.

97
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,750
Excuse me! Prepare to
eat your words, nay-sayer.

98
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,791
I've already plucked a name
for the facts in question,

99
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,041
as if from thin air!

100
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,666
We shall call it:
Kyouma's Nostalgia Drive!

101
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,708
I, propose referring
to it as KND for short.

102
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,791
Catchy anagrams are
far more marketable--

103
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:38,416
Sounds like a fast food chain. 

104
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,875
Duly noted, temporary assistant!

105
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:41,791
Now if you'll just let...

106
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,458
I say we have a
show of hands...

107
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:46,291
Who here is good with
"Kyouma's Nostalgia Drive?"

108
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,750
Come on! Neither of you?! 

109
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,375
Sorry, I agree with her.
It's not a bad name...

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,625
But even when you don't

111
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,625
use the letters it makes
me think of a charity.

112
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,333
Yeah. 'sides,
"Kyouma"? Nice try.

113
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,666
In the interest of keeping
it cute and simple...

114
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,791
Since it goes against
the flow of time,

115
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,750
why not call it
"contrary-mail."

116
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,166
I don't get it. 

117
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,333
You have a lot to
learn about "cute."

118
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,916
Why are we arguing

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,125
when it should clearly be "The
Mail That Leapt Through Time"?

120
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,166
Because we're not entering
it into a film festival.

121
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,666
Now you're just being a brat. 

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,250
At least my idea
doesn't make you

123
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,500
wanna order a bucket
of chicken wings!

124
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,500
Balance, man! We need
romance and concision!

125
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,333
Then I'll squish it to
"Time Leaper..."

126
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,250
Except that now we don't
know what's leaping, do we?

127
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,333
Maybe we could work
"banana" in there somewhere?

128
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:28,666
Ah! Can you
imagine our logo?!

129
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,083
Too-too-roo!

130
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,083
Ha...! Just wait till you
get a load of this one...!

131
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,208
We call it...
"Flux Mail Capacitor."

132
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,791
Are we implying that it
runs on plutonium now?

133
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,791
Ooo! Ooo!
"DeLorean Mail"...!

134
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,041
That doesn't make sense. 

135
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,083
Close enough...

136
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,041
Though, if we go with that,

137
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,791
I'd suggest we
shorten it to "D-Mail."

138
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,791
Oh! That's a good one! 

139
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,583
Great. We can move on. Finally. 

140
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,125
We now begin our experiments
with D-Mail (Real Name TBA)...

141
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,208
Drop the TBA. We've got it. 

142
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,375
Fine. I dub this
Operation Wyrd--

143
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,625
You can drop that, too. 

144
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,875
I'd like to get
back to the whole

145
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,833
"we don't have a clue
what's happening" issue.

146
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,250
I mean, we're pretty sure the
electrical surges are related,

147
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,750
but that's about it.

148
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,583
Precisely what we've gathered
here to establish, Hack...

149
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,500
Thanks to my genius, however,
we're not shooting in the dark.

150
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,458
You, dear cohorts,
have overlooked

151
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,916
the simplest yet most
crucial condition involved...

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,250
To wit: Time! 

153
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,416
The first D-Mail made
its apparent leap backward

154
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,750
between noon and one o'clock;

155
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:27,875
the second at approximately
six in the evening.

156
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,000
Thus... if we conduct
our experiments

157
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,000
so that the same
windows are observed,

158
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,125
success is a
strong likelihood.

159
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,333
Dude. If it were that easy

160
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,875
you think we'd be the
ones to discover it?

161
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,041
If you can do
better I'm all ears.

162
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,416
Mayuri! Banana me! 

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,250
We're running kind of
low on the test subjects...

164
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,291
We could just use
something else, couldn't we?

165
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:46,958
Maybe a cucumber... 

166
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,500
Hack! This is hardly
the time... No.

167
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,583
The effect on bananas
classifies as a known.

168
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,916
So, if you'd be so good as
to insert what we have left...

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,041
"Insert..." 

170
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,541
Oh, grow up...! I swear... 

171
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,625
I'm sorry, sweetie...

172
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,041
Look, I promise to
buy you some more

173
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,166
as soon as we're done here.

174
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,208
Aw, really...?!

175
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,791
These two guys never
buy me anything.

176
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,833
It's gonna be awesome having
you around the lab, I can tell!

177
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,291
Oww!

178
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,666
Please... Enough
with the show-boating.

179
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,416
Shut up. 

180
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,333
Leave my friend alone, ouchies.

181
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,875
Oh, it's not that bad. 

182
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,916
Put away the tea
set, Princess Ow.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,708
There's work to do.
Send me a text.

184
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,958
Okay, okay. 

185
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,500
Minute thirty
good for the timer?

186
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:29,541
Yes... Commence Operation Wyrd! 

187
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,208
Now! 

188
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes... That's it!
Show me what you've got!

189
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,750
The fruit is where?! 

190
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,500
It's a gel-nana, it worked!

191
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,500
Whoa... 

192
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,166
Just as I hypothesized!

193
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,166
Time of day is an
essential component

194
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,625
in how the D-Mail system works!

195
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:03,583
I am a genius! 

196
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,000
Nice job, Okabe.

197
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:07,625
I, was kind of inclined to
doubt you at first, but...

198
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,083
Forgiven...

199
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,333
It is quite enough to see that

200
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,500
you are appropriately
awed by my intellect.

201
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,375
Whatever. Did you get the text? 

202
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:20,166
Indeed... Five days ago,
to be exact.

203
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,250
Yeah, but there's two.

204
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,541
Did you send another one? 

205
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,708
Nuh-uh. Just the one.

206
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,208
Interesting. It's been split up.

207
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,625
I'm not familiar
with this vernacular.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
In America it's a compliment. 

209
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,875
You know, now
that I think about it,

210
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,500
your D-mail to me the other
day was all broken up, too.

211
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,791
Part of it was cut off,
as a matter of fact.

212
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:48,125
And 'course it popped
up five days earlier...

213
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,250
I know, right? Probably
some physical... law...

214
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,833
Wait that would mean
my head's full of air...

215
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,083
There is no way
that's a compliment!

216
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,625
How are you just
now getting that?

217
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,583
That vile little minx and her
infernal insults...! Blast!

218
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,250
Are you stocking up
for the end of times...?

219
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,541
Ramen and one-- <i>one</i> --bag
of paraffin chocolate

220
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,750
is more than enough.

221
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,916
It looks like you're
amping up for a bender.

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,250
What, a guy can't celebrate
a successful experiment?

223
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,541
Put em back, lard silo.

224
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,250
Screw. You. 

225
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,458
My god...

226
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,708
I was so excited about our
success I neglected to weigh

227
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,791
the reality of what
we've uncovered here...

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,333
Mayuri's knee deep
in this, too...

229
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,666
Why on earth did I tell her?

230
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,541
Well, if it isn't my old
pen pal Shining Finger.

231
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,333
Yes, hi.

232
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,500
What is wrong with you?
I'm right here.

233
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,000
Where... where's your phone?

234
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,875
Well, I'd tell you
if you were authorized

235
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,875
to be briefed on the
epoch-ushering experiment

236
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,625
it is currently central to...

237
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,083
Ready when you are.

238
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,875
Um, boss...?

239
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:29,666
Who's this spank worthy--

240
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,083
Er, I mean, totally respectable
young meatspace angel

241
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,791
with the knock-out
ass in front of me?

242
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,500
How rude of me.

243
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,333
Daru, meet Kiryuu Moeka,
a.k.a. Shining Finger.

244
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,000
Hello there, my lovely lady...

245
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,000
And just like that,
a man's drop-kicked

246
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,375
back into the shady underworld
of all-night RPGs...

247
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,000
Yo...! Check it...!

248
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,500
You party people bringin'
the ruckus or what?

249
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,833
In a manner of speaking.

250
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,208
Our researches will indeed
bring, as you say, the--

251
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,666
Yeah, that's real
crunk and all, but...

252
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,125
Papa Bald Cap is seriously
pissed off at you guys...

253
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,250
Says the vibrations from your
floor are givin' him migraines.

254
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,875
"You want your rent to give
you a damn migraine?!"...

255
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,250
I can't do the voice,
but you get it.

256
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,541
Damn it all...! Hack!

257
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,416
Run upstairs and tell the girls
to suspend all experimentation.

258
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
I'll try and
sweet-talk the cur.

259
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,583
Roger. I'm on top of it...

260
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,166
good luck not getting evicted. 

261
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,291
Is Makise Kurisu
still up there?

262
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:34,000
Huh? She is.
But I don't understand

263
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,458
what that could
possibly mean to you...

264
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:37,708
Why were you giving
her the evil eye...?

265
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,958
What happened in your past? 

266
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,583
Nothing happened in the past. 

267
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,500
I see it now:
you were turtle fishing

268
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,541
and she carelessly let
slip through her fingers

269
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,500
the finest red-eared
slider ever--

270
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:53,333
Stop it! I'd never
seen her before!

271
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,125
Why are you here
gabbin' with me anyway?

272
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,333
Shouldn't you be groveling?

273
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,250
I don't know what
you're doing up there

274
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,833
and I don't wanna know...

275
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:06,250
But if it involves an elephant,
you're in breach of your lease.

276
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,125
Well, I can assure you
sir it is not a pachyderm,

277
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,083
though it is definitely huge.

278
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:15,125
Not to worry, though.
You'll be vexed no more today--

279
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,958
Why aren't you stopping?

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,541
Did I or did I not give
you orders to desist?!

281
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,250
Hey, I told them to.
She's the one who kept on.

282
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,166
I sent you another one.
Did it go through?

283
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,791
How am I supposed to know?!

284
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,875
You had your phone
on you five days ago.

285
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,875
Stop mocking--

286
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,291
Oh, that's right;
your phone rang

287
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,041
like a bazillion times
while you were gone.

288
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,125
Even when we
weren't running tests.

289
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,791
She's was five feet
from me for half of these!

290
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,250
Who're you mad at?

291
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:54,041
Oh, just ignore him, hon.
He's running low on calcium.

292
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,625
I am not! 

293
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,708
I realize you're preoccupied,
but if you think it's important,

294
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,166
I gleaned enough
data to work up

295
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,375
a rough sketch of
how D-Mail works.

296
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,625
What?!

297
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,166
I've calculated that one
second on the timer equals

298
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,708
an hour in reality,

299
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,541
moving upstream to the
flow of linear time...

300
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,250
That means a minute
thirty translates to five days.

301
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,708
Pretty balls-out
she locked on to

302
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,083
how to control the distance
a text travels back, huh?

303
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,166
Indeed. But being limited
to thirty-six characters

304
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,791
is still our Achilles' Heel.

305
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,250
I'd like to find a way
to improve on that,

306
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,666
if at all possible...

307
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,666
As it stands now,
it's not very practical.

308
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,666
Well, that's not such a big
deal if you don't have

309
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,750
to send anything really
large back in time...

310
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,666
Hey, maybe it's hard because of
the whole Car Black Hole thing.

311
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,291
I think you mean,
"Kerr" Black Hole.

312
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,708
That's it.

313
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,291
A Kerr Black Hole is too
tight to let big stuff through.

314
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,958
Maybe it just needs a
little, uh. practice...

315
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,541
Will you knock it off?! 

316
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,916
I suggest rest.

317
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,208
We can hit the problem
with fresh minds tomorrow...

318
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,416
Each of us should
feel proud of what's

319
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,958
been accomplished here today.

320
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,250
Because of us,
August 2, 2010 is now a date

321
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,500
that will live in the
hearts of mankind forever!

322
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,833
On this day, the
Future Gadget Laboratory

323
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,916
breathed new life into a
dream as old as the hills...

324
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,416
For we have bridled time!

325
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:09,458
Well, except that SERN
kind of already beat us to it...

326
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,000
And saying we've bridled
it is presumptuous.

327
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,541
We're still stuck in
the preliminary phase.

328
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,916
I am attempting
to be poetic here...!

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,625
Must you insist on
sapping the thunder

330
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:19,708
out of every single utterance?!

331
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,541
Okarin...

332
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,625
I'm super proud of what
we've all accomplished here.

333
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,666
Where am I?

334
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,125
Don't panic.
You're not the one moving.

335
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,708
Time and space have
switched places here.

336
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,416
So this is an event horizon...

337
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,458
Space can no longer
be moved through,

338
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:10,208
and time as you understand
it ceases to exist.

339
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,791
One second to you,

340
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:14,708
for me stretches out past the
horizon line of what is real.

341
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:17,083
Are you saying that
space has fallen away?

342
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,083
That time has no part of it?

343
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:24,375
What's moving, then?
Me, or the universe?

344
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't look back...
Eternity isn't infinite...

345
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,666
Reality has a
beginning and an end...

346
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,708
Always has. Always will.

347
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:45,000
If that's true...
Where does that leave me?

348
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:48,541
Move forward...
Look over the edge.

349
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:05,541
You're on my last nerve...
For cryin' out loud get a life.

350
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,916
"Sorry about yesterday."

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,541
"I really need to drop by
and talk to you soon."

352
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,583
Does it not occur to
you that people sleep?

353
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,416
Well who the Hell
wouldn't be at this hour?!

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

355
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,125
Seriously? I'm right here.

356
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,958
Ugh. Whatever it
is, just say it...

357
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,750
Look, this is getting ridiculous
and it's very early...

358
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,791
Wait, is this your idea
of hounding yours truly

359
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,750
for an exclusive
interview or something?

360
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,875
Why won't you speak?

361
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
Oh, of course...

362
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,958
The aura of big, bad, legendary
mad scientist Hououin Kyouma

363
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:03,916
robs yet another innocent
lamb of her powers of speech!

364
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,458
It's just... easier...
sending texts...

365
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:13,500
I came here... to... uh... well,
you know... see the... IBN.

366
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,791
Very well... But see
is all you shall do...

367
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,750
That done, you will
leave at once. Understood?

368
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,250
Maybe she's just part

369
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,666
of what Daru calls
the "antiquing crowd."

370
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,333
Feel free, but beware...

371
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,583
Photograph my face

372
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:48,041
and you'll leave me no
choice but to silence--

373
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,333
You expect me to
let you borrow it?

374
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,333
And help you haul it?

375
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,416
What part of "look only" do you
fail to comprehend, my dear?

376
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,000
Besides, if you
intend to make off

377
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,916
with it you could at least do me
the kindness of asking out loud.

378
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,750
May I please... uh... borrow it?

379
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,583
I'm afraid you're
out of luck there...

380
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,958
I myself only have it
on loan for an interval

381
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,000
from a trusted friend...

382
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,708
I am honor-bound to return it

383
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,583
once my researches
are at an end.

384
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,708
So... who did you
borrow it from?

385
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,666
Some friends from
the Yanabayashi Shrine.

386
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,125
Good morrow, my peeps! 

387
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,791
Oh... Hey I didn't
realize we had a guest.

388
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,000
Ah. You recall my
friend from yesterday...

389
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,708
This rotund fellow
is nothing less

390
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,583
than my right hand man,
our good hack, Daru.

391
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,333
Hacker, thank you very much.

392
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,791
Had a couple ideas
how we might tart up

393
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,416
the Phone Wave a
notch, by the way.

394
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,833
I mean it's such
an ass-pain as is.

395
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,125
Some serious tweakage
is needed if we're gonna

396
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,625
make sendin' mail to the past
user friendly, am I right?

397
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:56,041
Uh... Yes... You misheard him...

398
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,041
He, didn't say
"sending mail to the past,"

399
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,041
he said "Kending
eorfals du cree clast."

400
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,208
Ancient Sumerian, you see.

401
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,916
Yes, yes. Roughly translated,

402
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,666
it means "would you
care for an omelet?"

403
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,000
Good morning, Okarin...!

404
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,500
Mind if I heat up
my chicken tenders

405
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,375
before you start your
time travel experiments?

406
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,750
Morning everyone.

407
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,208
I think I had an "ah-ha" moment

408
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,708
about the time
machine last night.

409
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,791
It's me... Situation critical...

410
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:24,583
No, no... An outsider's
caught wind of numero eight...

411
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,458
Yes, of course I'll handle it.

412
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,958
Okay, what is it this time?

413
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,458
Apparently it involves
ignoring the three of us.

414
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,416
...the Organization know we're
performing experiments simi--

415
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,958
Damn it all, I'm trying
to have a conversation!

416
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,333
Is it true?

417
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,375
F... B?

418
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,625
Very well... I guess since
the cat's out of the bag...

419
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:01,333
I'm loath to do this, however...

420
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,916
Kiryuu Moeka...

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,958
As of this moment, I christen
you lab member Double-O Five!
