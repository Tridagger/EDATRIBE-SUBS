1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,416
Your time machine's
now the property of SERN.

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,833
Hold on...!
You can't just storm--

3
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:18,083
Makise Kurisu...
Okabe Rintarou...

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:21,916
Hashida Itaru...
You'll be coming with us.

5
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,375
And Mayuri?

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,875
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,333
The little one isn't needed.

8
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,583
Please, no...

9
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,250
I'm begging you.

10
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:47,666
For FB... For... For...

11
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,375
Oh, god... Mayuri!

12
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,500
Please, no...

13
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,250
What the hell is this?!!

14
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,000
Stand up, slowly...

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,750
Okabe...! Please......!

16
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:42,250
She's gonna kill
you if you don't!

17
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:50,541
I swear ... on my life...
you will pay...!

18
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,041
The big-screen...

19
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,708
Down in the shop...

20
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,500
It's on right now.

21
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,666
Do it! Now!

22
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,208
Are you sure?!

23
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:44,416
Just start the time-leap!

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,041
But... We don't even
know if it's gonna work!

25
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:52,041
Goddammit, Do as I say!

26
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,041
Okabe!

27
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:59,458
Please work!

28
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,541
Mayuri's grandma died
when we were young...

29
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:47,125
To Mayuri... it's like
time itself had stopped.

30
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,875
She visited the grave
every day... without fail...

31
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,125
rain or shine...
for the next six months.

32
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,083
She would just stand there...

33
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,208
her grandma's
pocket watch in hand...

34
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,333
she'd gaze patiently
into the sky...

35
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,500
As if... as if the woman
was coming back for her soon.

36
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,583
And one day... she almost did.

37
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,875
The sun broke
through the clouds...

38
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:29,416
Mayuri was swathed in light.

39
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,875
She reached into
the sky... unafraid.

40
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:39,375
At that moment... I knew
I was about to lose her.

41
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:40,666
Mayuri!

42
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,833
Okarin...?

43
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,166
I'm not letting them take you!

44
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,916
You're my hostage,
do you hear me...?

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,458
You can't escape
a mad scientist,

46
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,750
so don't even bother
trying...! Please!

47
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,000
In my panic...

48
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,875
I blurted out the first
thing that came to mind.

49
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,458
A line from some
scenery-chewing bad guy...

50
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,666
care of a TV show
we'd grown up on...

51
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,583
'Kay...

52
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:17,500
Better stay, then...
Since I'm your hostage and all.

53
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,750
You're gonna have to wait
for me... 'Kay, Grammy?

54
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey guys, you know what?

55
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,625
Looks pretty cute, huh!

56
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,708
I've got to get her into
cosplay one of these days.

57
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,375
I give you permission
to hug my oopa cushion...

58
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,375
Is your head all empty or what?

59
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,875
What's with you?

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,125
Did you doze off
just now or something?

61
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,833
What time is it...?

62
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,625
Huh?

63
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,833
What time?!

64
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,125
Hey, chill...
It's almost five o'clock...

65
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,125
We're going
shopping, remember?

66
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,250
Shopping? But I...

67
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,750
I'll be a bro and
order the pizzas, yeah?

68
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:11,416
Knock yourself out...
but no Hawaiian, okay?

69
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,791
Too much going on there.

70
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,875
I hear ya.

71
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,666
the time-leap succeeded...
It's earlier today...

72
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,041
You ready?

73
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,958
Huh? Where's Mayuri?!
I need to know where she is!

74
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,125
Jeez. Calm down with
the shouting already.

75
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,208
Mayuri headed out
a few minutes ago.

76
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,625
She went to invite Ruka
to the party, remember?

77
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,250
Um, you going solo?

78
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,916
The press conference
is cancelled!

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,625
Wait, cancelled...?
Just like that?

80
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,166
Something up, dude?

81
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,583
Executive decision...!
We're done for today...!

82
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
Just... go home, all right?!

83
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,125
What's wrong with you?

84
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,041
I told you to leave...!
Okay...?! So just do it!

85
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,250
Hell was that about...?

86
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,416
He was fine until his
cell phone went off.

87
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,291
His cell phone...

88
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,375
Too-too-roo!
This is Mayushii...!

89
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,291
Actually, it's my phone,
so leave me a message, okay?

90
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,583
I'll call ya back!

91
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,541
I don't see any discernible
change in the world-line...

92
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,375
This is different than D-mail...

93
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,375
I've really gone back
to 5 p.m. this afternoon.

94
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,291
Clackety-clack...!

95
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,166
Look, Mommy--it's
the bullet train!

96
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,500
That's a whole different kind...

97
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,458
The bullet-trains
are white, honey.

98
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:32,041
After this... Mayuri brings
Suzuha to the lab... and then...

99
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,791
Do I go to the police...?

100
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,916
No, they'll toss me
into the drunk tank,

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,958
or a straightjacket...

102
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,833
Who's gonna
believe me...?! God...!

103
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,125
I only have three hours
left to save her...!

104
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,958
Mayuri!

105
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,583
Oh...! Okabe...!
I mean... Hey, Kyouma--!

106
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,875
Tell me that
Mayuri's still here!

107
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:54,375
I... I'm sorry...
She's already left...

108
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,375
How long ago?! I need to know.

109
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,541
Uh... about half an
hour ago, I think...?

110
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,416
She said she was
heading back to the lab...

111
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,416
Hasn't she shown up yet?

112
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,375
Um... thanks, by the way...

113
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,125
It was really nice
of you to invite me

114
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,791
to your party later, buuut...

115
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,166
I don't think I'll be able to--

116
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,958
Did she mention stopping
anywhere on the way?!

117
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,083
She... did say something
about that... But she...

118
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,250
Look, if she comes back ,
you have her call me at once!

119
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,666
It's life or death!

120
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,333
Yeah... Okay...

121
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:22,916
If the world-line
hasn't shifted,

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,083
Mayuri's actions will lead
her to the same fate...

123
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,791
She's going to die again
unless I can change things...!

124
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,000
Where the hell is she...?!

125
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,666
Hello!. You've reached
Faris's cell-phone!

126
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,083
Leave a meow-ssage,
and I'll call you ba--

127
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,541
Damn it, why the
hell can't I find you?

128
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,208
Mayuri--thank God!

129
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,625
Nope. Sorry.

130
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,958
No, really it's... fine...

131
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,375
I told you we're
done for today...

132
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,458
I need you to leave at--

133
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,333
Not till you answer my question.

134
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,750
Did you time-leap back
here from the future?

135
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,333
Yes or no?

136
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,583
How'd you figure it out?

137
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,083
You answered your
phone and flipped out.

138
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,708
I just connected the dots...

139
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,833
Something happened,
didn't it...? Something bad.

140
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,750
Yeah... But there's no
time to explain right now...

141
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,208
Just run... Please.

142
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:19,583
Sure. Okay. Where am
I supposed to run to?

143
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,958
Anywhere...

144
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,458
Get yourself as far away
from the lab as possible...

145
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,375
It doesn't matter.

146
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,500
You're so explaining later.

147
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,083
Deal... Get Daru out, too.

148
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,833
All right... Hey.

149
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,375
Yeah?

150
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,083
Don't do anything too crazy.

151
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,666
Perish the thought.

152
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,625
What are the odds, huh?

153
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,291
How do I get to
Ochanomizu? I've got no--

154
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,958
Have you seen Mayuri?!

155
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:49,041
Dial back on the caffeine...

156
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:52,083
But yeah, she just invited
me to the party tonight.

157
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:52,958
Where was she?!

158
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,750
Hang a right at the corner--

159
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,708
Hey...! At least tell me
where Ochanomizu is at!

160
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,666
I'm supposed to take
Nae shopping later,

161
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,375
but Sir Cue Ball
didn't give me a map!

162
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,791
Just ask a policeman!

163
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,958
Keep Nae out as
late as you can!

164
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,750
Do not go back to the shop!

165
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,166
What are you on about?

166
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,250
I'll explain everything later!

167
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,083
Thank God...

168
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,416
Mayuri!

169
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,250
Okarin, look...! It's the
first star of the night!

170
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,666
Hey, What are you doing?!

171
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,916
We're not going back
to the lab tonight!

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,708
But... what about the party?

173
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:39,791
It's canceled...! I've
already told the others!

174
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,416
Huh......? How come?

175
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,208
I'll explain later!

176
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,458
But I just invited Suzuha,

177
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,791
and Daru said he was gonna
order some pizzas, rememb--?

178
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,666
Dammit! Just do as I say!

179
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,333
Please don't yell.

180
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,750
I don't understand... all the
science stuff that you do...

182
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,708
but I can usually tell what's
going on in your head, anyway...

183
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,041
And right now,

184
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,125
I feel like I don't
understand anything at all.

185
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:12,166
I guess you... kinda
time-leapt after all, huh?

186
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,583
Yes I did.

187
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,125
It's not as though
I wanted to...

188
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,208
Okay...? It was something
I had no choice over.

189
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,416
We have to go now.

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,833
I promise I'll explain all this.

191
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah... I'm sorry...

192
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,083
Guess you just startled
me a little bit, that's all...

193
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:38,333
Don't apologize...
You've done nothing wrong.

194
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,541
Lotta folks here, huh...

195
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,833
Guess It's to be
expected with rush hour.

196
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:57,125
Oh yeah... but then how come
the platforms are all empty?

197
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,625
Developments on the metro:
a terrorist bomb threat

198
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,791
called in to local
authorities just moments ago

199
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,291
has shut down every line.

200
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,791
Still no clue when the trains'll
be up and running again...

201
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,416
Shut down by the bomb threat...!

202
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Of course the trains
aren't running!

203
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,375
Is that bad?

204
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,083
We need to get to the
subway as quickly as we c--!

205
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,083
Okabe Rintarou, yes...?

206
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,166
Something the matter?

207
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,250
You're coming with us.

208
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,541
Why're you just standing in the
middle of the damn walkway?!

209
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:30,791
Run!

210
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,083
Get out of here, Mayuri!

211
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,375
Whatever you do,
don't stop running!

212
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
Why are they chasing us?!

213
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,416
Okarin!

214
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,583
Don't worry about me...!
Just keep running!

215
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,958
Reporting that Shiina Mayuri
has been neutralized...

216
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,041
There was no problem...

217
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,375
Okabe Rintarou has
been apprehended.

218
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,708
The mission is complete.

219
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,125
Mayuri!

220
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,833
I won't let you do this
to her--do you hear me...?!

221
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,125
I'm going to save you, Mayuri!

222
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,791
I swear it...!

223
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,291
On my life!

224
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,125
Wait, cancelled...?
Just like that?

225
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,625
Something up, dude?

226
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:50,166
Yes... You see...

227
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,666
I have it on good authority
that Mr. Braun's

228
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,500
in a vile mood today, and he's
likely to take it out on us.

229
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,375
Lemme guess. You managed
to piss him off again?

230
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,541
I dunno... I guess...

231
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,916
But what about Mayuri?

232
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,416
Look, I plan to
tell her about it...

233
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,375
The point is, you guys need
to get out of here ASAP.

234
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,250
And no, this isn't
my idea of a joke.

235
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,583
I didn't play that
off very well...

236
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:15,541
They have to at least suspect
I was being dishonest...

237
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,125
Not that it matters
either way, I suppose...

238
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,875
So long as they
clear out of the lab,

239
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,500
they can think whatever
the hell they like.

240
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,333
Too-too-roo!
This is Mayushii...!

241
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,333
Actually, it's my phone,
so leave me a message, okay?

242
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,875
Looking for her
takes too much time!

243
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,541
If I don't find her, and soon,

244
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,416
this is going to pan
out the same way...!

245
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,000
Hello?

246
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,583
Rukako--hey!.
It's me...! Okabe!

247
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,875
Oh! Okabe...
I mean, hey, Kyouma--!

248
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,791
Is she there?!

249
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,458
Huh?

250
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:51,375
Is she still there?!

251
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,750
Mayuri...?

252
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,833
Yeah, she is, but...
she's heading out right now--

253
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,791
No, stop her...! Order her
to stay put until I get there!

254
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,791
Don't let her out of your sight!

255
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,291
But, I think she's just
going back to the lab--

256
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,416
Listen, I am begging
you to stop her!

257
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,416
Uh, okay...! Wait up, Mayuri!

258
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,666
Huh...?

259
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,375
Clackety-clack...!

260
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,583
Look, Mommy--it's
the bullet train!

261
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,083
That's a whole different kind...

262
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,833
The bullet-trains
are white, honey.

263
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,458
Mayuri!

264
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,541
Heya, Okarin! Too-too-roo!

265
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,666
You didn't have
to run here, silly...

266
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,541
I was just gonna pop over
to Fubuki's to fix her outfit

267
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,750
before I head back to the lab.

268
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,541
Fubuki...? Your
cosplay friend...?

269
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,708
Yeah! She texted me that one
of the hems I did came undone,

270
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,166
so I'm gonna re-stitch it.
I'll be super-quick!

271
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,250
That's why I couldn't
track you down before!

272
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,375
And I'll go straight over to
the lab when I'm finished...!

273
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,625
I wouldn't miss a second
of that party for anything!

274
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,208
Look, about the party...

275
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:51,416
I had to go ahead and
canc--I had to postpone it.

276
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,083
Awww...! How come?!

277
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,916
The lab is off-limits to us
for the foreseeable future...

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,541
It's out of my control.

279
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,208
That's a let-down...

280
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,958
I know. And I'm sorry.

281
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:04,791
But for right now, I need
you to come with me--Alright?

282
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,458
But Fubuki's hem--

283
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,875
It's just gonna
have to wait...

284
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,625
This is really important, okay?

285
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,250
Um, is something
the matter, Kyouma...?

286
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,750
Yeah... But we're
gonna get it sorted out.

287
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,166
On a trip.

288
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,208
Huh...?! You mean, just
the two of you on a trip...?!

289
00:17:19,291 --> 00:17:21,250
Oh, my, that's sudden...!

290
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,583
Wow... I guess I can
help Fubuki tomorrow,

291
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,791
but this is really random...
Where are we gonna go?

292
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,791
It's a surprise. Come on.

293
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,541
Don't want to miss our train.

294
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,666
Yeah but, I haven't even packed
an overnight bag or anything,

295
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,083
and won't I need some money--

296
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,541
I'll deal with all that on
the way. Now... shall we?

297
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,166
Uh...! Kay! I'm
coming--wait for me!

298
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,083
Uh... Hey...!

299
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:44,875
Yeah...?

300
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
Have a good time.

301
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,333
'Kay...! See ya soon, Ruka!

302
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,166
Aren't we taking the train...

303
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,958
'cause the station
is over there.

304
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,083
Taking the subway.

305
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,875
Okie-dokie then.

306
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,041
It's been a long time since
you led me somewhere

307
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,458
by the hand like this...

308
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,500
You used to do it a bunch.

309
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,375
Yeah.

310
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,208
Change of plans.

311
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,458
Huh?

312
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:00,416
All clear... On three.

313
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,291
Just Kurisu...

314
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,083
Oh no. I just wound you!
Don't tell me you're broken.

315
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,416
So not fair...I've taken extra
good care of you and everything.

316
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,583
It sure is crowded in here, huh.

317
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,708
The Soubu Line
is shut down, so...

318
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,208
Oh...! Is it really?
I didn't know.

319
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,666
Uh-huh.

320
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,291
I heard somebody
say in passing that

321
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:46,375
there'd been some
kind of bomb threat.

322
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,208
That's just horrible.

323
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,458
Okarin...?

324
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:58,083
Listen... There's a bunch of
stuff I wanna ask you about,

325
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:01,041
but I know you already
have so much on your mind.

326
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,583
So pretty please...

327
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:08,000
just promise me you'll explain
all this when it's over, okay?

328
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,625
I will.

329
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,125
I promise you.

330
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,875
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,750
Huh?

332
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,083
I know I'm not useful
like the others...

333
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,333
And I'm sorry.

334
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,416
Just you wait...
We'll have that party.

335
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:37,916
Yeah.

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,416
Someday.

337
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,583
Someday...

338
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,333
I know it.

339
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,500
Mayuri--surprise!

340
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,125
I didn't...

341
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
I didn't mean to...

342
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,750
I just wanted...
to surprise Mayuri.

343
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,666
I didn't know I was
gonna fall down...

344
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,875
You're not going to die...

345
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,875
I don't care...
what it takes...!

346
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,875
I swear it!
