1
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:33,583
This summer vacation
was an eventful one,

2
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,916
to say the least...

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,875
As a result, I did virtually
none of the homework

4
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,625
I'd been assigned
for the break.

5
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,083
My most recent adventure

6
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,708
involved posing as
Zapper's boyfriend

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,250
and fighting a sorcerer...

8
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,125
I'm not the only one
who's been busy, though...

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,458
Shortly after midnight
on August 31st,

10
00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:50,166
Accelerator had an unexpected
encounter of his own...

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,000
[Music]

12
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,208
After losing a fight
to that Kamijo guy,

13
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,791
I seem to have
lost my status

14
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,041
as the strongest esper
in Academy City.

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,791
I'm still a
Level Five esper.

16
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,166
And my abilities haven't
lessened or changed at all.

17
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,416
But no matter how many times
I prove myself against them,

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,750
these fools keep thinking
they can challenge me.

19
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,708
I'm trying...

20
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,625
but I can't figure out
what the difference is.

21
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,458
Something is
different, though.

22
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,750
I can feel it in the way
people look at me ...

23
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,958
but I can't put
my finger on it...

24
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,291
What has changed about me?

25
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:43,375
I may be a nun, but I'm
still a girl, you jerk!

26
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,208
I refuse to believe that
the sight of me in the bed

27
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,291
didn't affect you at
least a little bit.

28
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,875
I'm glad I can reflect
that noise away.

29
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,791
Huh...? A tiny
walking blanket...

30
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,958
and it's talking to me...

31
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,000
What does it want?

32
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,625
"Oh, my...

33
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,041
so unresponsive...

34
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,583
That's a pretty
fascinating indicator

35
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:44,458
of your personality type...

36
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:46,750
but it doesn't seem like
you're ignoring me on purpose...

37
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,625
and you're not trying
to get away from me."

38
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,916
"So I must conclude

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,708
that you're the world's
biggest space cadet,"

40
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,666
Misaka Misaka says,
tilting her head.

41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,000
Who is this little freak?

42
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,041
Misaka Misaka is
vehemently trying

43
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,125
to assert her own existence,
and by remaining silent,

44
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
you're invalidating
her presence!

45
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,000
Huh?

46
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,333
Hold it... you said Misaka?

47
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,458
"Oh...! Misaka
Misaka's existence

48
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,458
has been acknowledged...! Yay!"

49
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,250
Misaka Misaka cries,
congratulating herself.

50
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,250
Short stuff...

51
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,416
Stop the chattering
and take that blanket off.

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,250
I wanna get a better
look at your face.

53
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
Hold on, you can't
just ask a girl

54
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,250
to take her clothes off
in the middle of the street.

55
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,416
That's downright creepy,
and I have no intention of...

56
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,000
What the...?

57
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:55,416
Misaka's serial
number is 20001...

58
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,125
She was commissioned
as the final Sister,

59
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,625
and is mostly referred
to as Last Order...

60
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,416
She was supposed to be
used in the experiment

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,916
and, obviously, wasn't...

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
This upsets Misaka Misaka.

63
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,875
She expected things
to be different.

64
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,125
You don't say.

65
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,250
As you well know, the
experiment was canceled.

66
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,000
Its termination meant
that Misaka Misaka

67
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,875
was released from
the incubator early,

68
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,416
so she's tinier than
all the other sisters.

69
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,000
Hey, are you
even listening?

70
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,541
I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

71
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,375
Since you were the focus
of the experiment,

72
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,500
you've got connections
with all the researchers...

73
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,625
Misaka Misaka thought

74
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,000
maybe you could
contact them for her.

75
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,750
Go ask somebody else.

76
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,708
"Yay...! Finally, a direct
response from you...!

77
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,875
Oh, wait. That was
a flat refusal,"

78
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,916
Misaka Misaka realizes sadly.

79
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,541
But unfortunately,

80
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,166
there's nobody else
for her to turn to,

81
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,583
so Misaka Misaka can't
afford to give up.

82
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,791
"Thanks in advance
for your help,"

83
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,875
Misaka Misaka says,
assuming that you'll give in.

84
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,416
"What a big building...!

85
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,583
Which apartment is yours?"

86
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,625
Misaka Misaka
asks curiously.

87
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,000
Number 304.

88
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,250
"Hello! It's a
pleasure to meet you,"

89
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,250
Misaka Misaka offers
a polite greeting.

90
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,833
Hey, what're you
doing in here?

91
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,958
"That wasn't your apartment.

92
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,041
It's somebody else's
place entirely...

93
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,000
Misaka Misaka is
angry with you now...

94
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,583
You can apologize
by telling me

95
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,041
which apartment
is really yours,"

96
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,708
Misaka Misaka
demands stiffly.

97
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,500
Oh, all right.
It's 307.

98
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,125
Hello! It's a
pleasure to meet you.

99
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,916
You're not the
delivery guy!

100
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,333
"How can you be so mean to a
poor, helpless little girl?"

101
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,833
Misaka Misaka asks,

102
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,166
sticking out her lower lip
and hunching over dejectedly.

103
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,916
What the hell happened
to my apartment?

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,166
Oh, wow...

105
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,291
It looks like a hurricane
came through here.

106
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,833
Misaka Misaka is
practically speechless.

107
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,958
Seriously lame.

108
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,791
"So, uh...

109
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:11,916
Don't you think you should
call Antiskill or Judgment

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,416
and report what
happened to this place?"

111
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,875
Misaka Misaka asks,

112
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:17,583
casually sticking her nose
in where it doesn't belong.

113
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,208
What are gonna do now...?

114
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,541
Given the circumstances,

115
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,208
you might be safer
sleeping on the streets

116
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,750
than staying here.

117
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,958
"Well... That might be true,

118
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,958
but even so, I would
prefer to stay here,"

119
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,333
Misaka Misaka
entreats earnestly.

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,583
What...?

121
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,625
Why do you want to?

122
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,916
Misaka Misaka doesn't
wanna be alone...

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,125
so... she'd like to
stay here with you.

124
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,833
Suit yourself.

125
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,541
I'm warning you right now,

126
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,541
sneaking into bed
with Misaka Misaka

127
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,041
is absolutely unacceptable,
so don't ev...

128
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,000
Shut up!

129
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,166
"You can tell a
lot about people

130
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,666
by observing their facial
expressions while they sleep,"

131
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,541
Misaka Misaka states with
a chipper note in her voice.

132
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,583
You're still here?
That's just excellent.

133
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,250
It's a beautiful morning...!

134
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,583
Actually, I guess a beautiful
afternoon at this point...

135
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,208
Anyway, I'm hungry...

136
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,583
Do you think you could make
me something yummy to eat...?

137
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,750
If you did, Misaka Misaka
would be really grateful to you!

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,708
Um... I'm pretty
sure the kitchen

139
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,666
is in the other direction.

140
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,791
Do I look like somebody who
does a lot of cooking to you?

141
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,250
"I was hoping
you would have an

142
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,416
apron-wearing, whisk-wielding,
domestic side to you,

143
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,750
but I suppose that was
being overly optimistic,"

144
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,083
Misaka Misaka grumbles.

145
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,333
Hey, wait for me!

146
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,416
Misaka Misaka is
wondering something.

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,458
Is that your natural hair
color, or do you dye it?

148
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,166
I couldn't tell you exactly
how it works, myself...

149
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,041
It has to do with
skin pigmentation,

150
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,791
the stuff that protects
you from ultraviolet rays.

151
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,250
My esper powers reflect
all those unwanted rays

152
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,625
from me automatically...

153
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,291
So I don't need pigmentation
like other people do.

154
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,458
"Interesting...

155
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,083
So it has nothing
to do with you

156
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,500
wanting to look cool
and intimidating,"

157
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,208
Misaka Misaka says, surprised.

158
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,625
-What should I get?
-I'm getting a headache.

159
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:19,958
There's so much
to choose from.

160
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,041
They have pizza and burgers
and spaghetti, too...

161
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,583
Ooh, and even curry!

162
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,833
That guy...

163
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,333
Is that Ao Amai?

164
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,416
That bastard...

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,583
What the hell could
he be doing here?

166
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,750
"What are you looking at?"

167
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,208
Misaka Misaka
inquires curiously.

168
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,000
Stay focused on
the task at hand!

169
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,916
Do you remember
why we're here?

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,250
"Yeah...! We're here to
get something good to eat,"

171
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,333
Misaka Misaka promptly
answers the question.

172
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,458
Thank you for waiting.

173
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,250
"This'll be the
first hot meal

174
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,125
I've ever had in
my whole life!"

175
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,500
Misaka Misaka says
with much glee.

176
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,375
Is this over yet?

177
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:25,666
What's the matter...?
Why aren't you eating it?

178
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,000
It's proper etiquette

179
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,750
to give thanks for
the food before eating.

180
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Misaka Misaka would like to
do so to show her manners.

181
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,208
Whatever...

182
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,625
Do what you want.

183
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,666
Thanks for all the food!

184
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:45,083
"This is the most
delicious food ever!"

185
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:47,208
Misaka Misaka
says excitedly.

186
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,958
Huh...? The stuff they serve
here is freeze-dried junk.

187
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,125
They're not really known
for their fine cuisine.

188
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,166
"That doesn't matter.
What's good is good...

189
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,250
And sitting down at the
table to eat with someone else

190
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,916
only makes it taste
that much better,"

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,375
Misaka Misaka explains
philosophically.

192
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,625
Yeah, sure...

193
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,666
I don't understand
what you're doing here...

194
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,791
You do know what happened to
the rest of your little family

195
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,291
when they met me,
don't you?

196
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,541
"My brainwaves are connected
to all other Misakas,

197
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,833
so of course I know
everything that happened,"

198
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:15,583
Misaka Misaka replies
matter-of- factly.

199
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,083
Then how can you sit here
with me looking so calm?

200
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,583
"The worth of Misakas
was explained to me,"

201
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,666
Misaka Misaka says.

202
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,541
Huh?

203
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,875
Even if an individual
Misaka unit dies

204
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,583
the Misaka Network
will remain intact,

205
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,041
and no important
information will be lost...

206
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,458
But even so, each Misaka
unit has worth of her own

207
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,958
beyond the Network.

208
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,625
There's only one of you in the
entire world, isn't there?

209
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,833
That Misaka was told there
are actually people out there

210
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,333
who shed tears when one
of the Misakas dies...

211
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:48,041
So we don't sacrifice
ourselves anymore.

212
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,708
Since we have
individual worth,

213
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,416
we can't keep throwing
our lives away.

214
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,375
That's what Misaka
Misaka believes.

215
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
And it's all
because of you...

216
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,000
Without you, the experiment
wouldn't have happened...

217
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,500
and souls would've
never been put

218
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:03,625
inside the lifeless
Misaka bodies...

219
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:06,208
So Misaka Misaka
is grateful to you.

220
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,125
You're grateful?

221
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,000
You know that's
absurd, right?

222
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,833
Don't you get that
I enjoyed killing you?

223
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,666
Doing it gave me a thrill
each and every time.

224
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,083
That isn't true.

225
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,333
Misaka Misaka has come to
a different conclusion...

226
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,958
You did not
actually desire

227
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,625
to go through
with the experiment...

228
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,916
or so Misaka Misaka
assesses the situation.

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,458
Oh, come on. You must be
seriously twisting the facts

230
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,791
to come up with that idea.

231
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,208
I was perfectly happy to
keep on killing you people

232
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,541
for as long as the
experiment was active...

233
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,750
I don't know why you
would think differently.

234
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,458
Think back to all
those battles...

235
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,666
You spoke to Misaka
many times during them.

236
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,083
"So...? Why would
you do that?"

237
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,833
Misaka Misaka says, asking
the obvious question.

238
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,500
Why are you running
away like that for?

239
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,166
Don't get me wrong,
I do appreciate the view.

240
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,666
You've got such a
cute little ass.

241
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,166
I hate to question you

242
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,041
when you're so diligently
performing your role

243
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,041
in an experiment to
increase my strength,

244
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:03,416
but you strike me as
unnaturally relaxed

245
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,333
given the situation.

246
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,375
I thought we might be
able to kill a little time

247
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:08,666
before we got to it...

248
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,958
but this is just hopeless.

249
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,000
There's no point
in trying to hold

250
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,000
a normal conversation with you.

251
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,416
In Misaka Misaka's
estimation,

252
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,583
you picked rather strange
times to make conversation.

253
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,208
Generally speaking,

254
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,375
the main reason you draw someone
into conversation with you

255
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,000
is to establish some sort
of connection with them.

256
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,416
"If you were really
only concerned

257
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,083
with the success
of the experiment,

258
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,333
then there would be no
reason for you to converse,"

259
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:34,625
Misaka Misaka
states reasonably.

260
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,791
I was trash talking.

261
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,250
I don't see how
that makes you think

262
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,500
I was trying to establish
a connection with you.

263
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,125
"Yes... that's the second odd
thing about your behavior,"

264
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,583
Misaka Misaka agrees,

265
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,625
holding up two fingers
to illustrate.

266
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,166
You were consistently
arrogant and rude...

267
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,791
Everything you said was
abusive towards Misaka...

268
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,833
That suggests that your
motivation went beyond

269
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,250
simply making
a connection.

270
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,333
However, the fact that
your words were cruel

271
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,750
does not mean that they
were intended maliciously.

272
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,916
In this analysis, we must
also consider the timing...

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,916
As far as Misaka Misaka
can recall,

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
you always initiated
conversation

275
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,583
before the battles began.

276
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,875
"It was almost like you were
trying to intimidate Misaka

277
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,125
into backing down...

278
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,708
like you wanted
Misaka to say

279
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,083
that she did not want to fight
you," Misaka Misaka observes.

280
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,583
Of course, it didn't work...

281
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,875
The Misakas couldn't
understand

282
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,666
what you were
attempting to do.

283
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,791
But what would you have
done if Misaka had told you

284
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,625
she didn't wish to continue?

285
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:29,875
Misaka Misaka believes

286
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,875
things would've turned
out very differently.

287
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,916
I'm getting tired of
listening to this crap.

288
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,750
Hey...

289
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:54,416
"Misaka Misaka's body
isn't complete yet.

290
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,750
Her physical condition
is still less than perfect.

291
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,708
Normally, she wouldn't
even be out of the incubator

292
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,166
at this point,"

293
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,958
Misaka Misaka clarifies
the reason for her collapse.

294
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,125
"Up until now, she has
been able to manage,

295
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,625
so she assumed she
would be all right.

296
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,458
Perhaps she was mistaken,"

297
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,875
Misaka Misa...

298
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,166
Hey...

299
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,833
"What is it...?

300
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,791
Why are you still
standing...?

301
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,625
You're not leaving
already, are you?"

302
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,625
Misaka Misaka
asks, pleadingly.

303
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,250
"There is still a
lot of food left."

304
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:30,458
Yeah, well after all this talk
I've kinda lost my appetite.

305
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,083
Oh, okay...

306
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,583
Misaka Misaka is
disappointed though...

307
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:37,041
She had hoped you would
finish the meal together...

308
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,166
She didn't even get
to order dessert.

309
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,541
Yeah, well.

310
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,833
Life's tough, kid.

311
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
You should get used to it.

312
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,875
Of all places, this is
where my feet carried me?

313
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,458
Hey.

314
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,000
Hey, Accelerator,
welcome back.

315
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,958
You didn't have to break
the door down, you know...

316
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,833
Your ID is still good
for another 90 days.

317
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,916
It's a little late
to be telling me that.

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,291
Right.

319
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,208
I bet you're having
the time of your life,

320
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,708
stuck in this room going
through data all day.

321
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,666
Actually, it's not
as fun as it looks...

322
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,958
I certainly wouldn't
mind the help

323
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,625
if you're here
to volunteer it.

324
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,583
Hah... I'll pass.

325
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,250
So, anyway...

326
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,791
I just came to
get the manual

327
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,333
for adjusting
the Sister units.

328
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:09,833
And also, I need to borrow some
of your conditioning equipment.

329
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,125
Don't ask why, Yoshikawa.

330
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,291
Think of it as an
outstanding contract fee

331
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,125
for ending the experiment
ahead of schedule.

332
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,666
Something's going on...

333
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,500
I didn't even notice it
until a couple hours ago...

334
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,708
I was just about to begin

335
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,666
purging the bugs in
their personality data

336
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,458
before you barged
into the lab...

337
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,875
-How did you know about it?
-Huh?

338
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,541
About the disturbance

339
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:32,625
strictly speaking, it should
actually be called a virus.

340
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,958
Hold on... A virus?

341
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,916
What are you
talking about?

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,250
Oh, I just assumed that's

343
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,250
why you came here
looking for the manual...

344
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,166
Did I ever explain to you
about the special unit

345
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,000
we developed
called Last Order?

346
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,791
No, you never did...

347
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,416
So, that one's special?

348
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,958
"That one" is, yes.

349
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,791
Last Order wasn't
created to be used

350
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,500
as part of the experiment.

351
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,166
You're saying you
didn't intend for me

352
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,708
to kill all of them
during the experiment?

353
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,375
That's right...

354
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,666
Think back to
the beginning.

355
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,750
Do you remember
how many battles

356
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:03,291
were projected
to take place

357
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,416
before the experiment
would come to a conclusion?

358
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,125
Exactly 20,000.

359
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,833
Misaka's serial
number is 20001...

360
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,833
She was commissioned
as the final Sister,

361
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,791
and is mostly referred
to as Last Order.

362
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,208
Yes...

363
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,000
She was a unit that
the experiment parameters

364
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,791
didn't call for.

365
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:25,291
Last Order is the "control
tower" for the Misaka Network...

366
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:29,708
As such, she was held in an
incomplete developmental state.

367
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,041
Her existence
was kept secret

368
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,208
even after the
experiment had ended...

369
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,833
But somebody
found out about her

370
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,625
and managed to overwrite
the code in her brain

371
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,250
with an illegal program.

372
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,041
Her escape from the
laboratory was an attempt

373
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,375
to prevent that somebody
from succeeding...

374
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,041
It's been seven days
since she got out.

375
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,666
The virus that
I've isolated

376
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,750
is set to trigger at midnight
tonight, September 1st...

377
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,125
If it does activate,
it will run rampant,

378
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:53,875
spreading through the
entire Misaka Network

379
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,708
and infecting
all the Sisters...

380
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,208
Once that happens,
there will be no stopping it.

381
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,958
We'll be helpless.

382
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,750
What does this virus contain
that's so dangerous?

383
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:03,666
As far as I can tell...

384
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,916
an order to launch

385
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,708
an indiscriminate
attack on humanity.

386
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,666
Ha! That is intriguing...

387
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,958
Who's behind it?

388
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,416
A terrorist group?
A rouge defense contractor?

389
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,750
Ao Amai.

390
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,000
One of the former Radio
Noise Project researchers...

391
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,750
Nobody else is in
a better position

392
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,166
to understand the Sisters'
personality data than he is.

393
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,916
I saw him earlier outside
a restaurant. Huh.

394
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,541
You can't be serious.

395
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,041
If what you
suspect is true,

396
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,666
how do we go about
stopping the virus

397
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,333
he's planted in her head?

398
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,041
I'm doing everything
I can to figure that out...

399
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,250
but if I can't find a
solution before time runs out,

400
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,583
there's only one choice.

401
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,416
You mean, that kid
is gonna have to be...

402
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,791
Uh-huh...

403
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,916
Her destruction will
be the only option...

404
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,666
but I'm working hard to make
sure that doesn't happen...

405
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,041
Of course, there's always
something you could do, too.

406
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,041
Hah...

407
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,541
In case you've
already forgotten,

408
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,291
I'm the one who killed ten
thousand of the Sisters...

409
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,250
and now you're asking
me to save one of them?

410
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,041
You were not in charge
of the situation.

411
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,458
We're the ones who
directed you to do

412
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,791
what you did to them...

413
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,000
There was no other way

414
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,916
that we could advance
you to a Level 6...

415
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,125
If we'd found a method that
didn't involve the Sisters,

416
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,041
you wouldn't've
had to kill anybody.

417
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,708
But unfortunately,
we had no choice.

418
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,166
That's a nice speech,

419
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,458
but I don't know that
it's enough to convince me

420
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,083
to trust you.

421
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,416
If you don't want
to help with this,

422
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,166
I'm not going to force you.

423
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,458
Right now, there are
two things you could do...

424
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,541
One is solving
the problem entirely

425
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,291
by tracking down Ao Amai

426
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,208
and getting him to give up
information on the virus.

427
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,791
The other would be securing
Last Order and the virus

428
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,166
before it activates and
returning her to the incubator

429
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,916
so we can contain
the threat.

430
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,666
You appear to be familiar
with both Amai and Last Order,

431
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,333
so I'll leave it at that.

432
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,666
Here's the necessary
data on both of them.

433
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,291
Choose whichever
you'd like.

434
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,500
I think I can guess
which you'll go for.

435
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:00,208
You've always been bigger on
destroying than protecting.

436
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,291
I guess I can't
argue with that.

437
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,500
This isn't exactly
a tough decision...

438
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,416
It's obvious which
one I should choose.

439
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:32,166
[Music]

440
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,375
With only a short
time remaining

441
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,041
before the virus
is triggered,

442
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,708
desperate measures
may be necessary.

443
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:04,750
Can Accelerator stop the
virus and save Last Order?

444
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,375
Next time, "Virus Code."

445
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:07,791
When science and
magic cross paths,

446
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:09,208
a story is born.
