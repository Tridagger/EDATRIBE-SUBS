1
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,083
If the strongest Level 5
in Academy City

2
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:37,666
is easily beaten by
the weakest Level Zero,

3
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,208
then surely they
would have no choice

4
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,833
but to suspend this absurd
experiment of theirs.

5
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,375
True, that's easier
said than done...

6
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:45,708
but it's still worth a try.

7
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,375
Don't you agree...

8
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,041
Misaka?

9
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:57,125
[Music]

10
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,833
Apparently there was flour
inside that container.

11
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,166
Hey, tell me something.

12
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,791
Have you ever heard
of a certain phenomenon

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,083
known as a dust explosion?

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,750
They can be quite
devastating.

15
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,875
Not fun, huh?

16
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,916
I told you, dust
explosions are nasty.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm surprised you lived.

18
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,125
Next time I try
something like that,

19
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,416
I need to remember not to put
myself in the middle of it...

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,875
I seriously thought
I was gonna die there.

21
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,500
You should be thrilled...

22
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,625
You accomplished something

23
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,625
nobody else in the
world has before...

24
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
Can't believe you
drove me to the point

25
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,333
where I damn near
got myself killed.

26
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,000
Try as hard as you want,
but you're wasting your time.

27
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,166
You won't make it
a step closer...

28
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,541
and let's be honest...

29
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,291
even supposing
you did make it,

30
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,791
what could you possibly
hope to accomplish?

31
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
You do know that my esper
power is the ability

32
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,333
to control any vector...?

33
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,125
All I would have to
do is touch you once...

34
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,583
With that one touch,

35
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,458
I could cause the blood
vessels and internal organs

36
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,083
from your body to burst...

37
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,500
Just so you know exactly
what you're up against.

38
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,000
Think about it...

39
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,750
You're still here, in
bad shape, but alive...

40
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,958
Considering that
I'm your opponent,

41
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,750
that's a miracle
in and of itself,

42
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,166
wouldn't you agree...?

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,833
Hoping for anything
more than that

44
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,541
is simply asking too much.

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,833
So then...

46
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,083
let's remedy that
situation, shall we?!

47
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,166
Good hit.

48
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,750
Damn, that wasn't
what I expected...

49
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,291
an impressively
solid hit...

50
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,708
I'm going to have to give
that one to you kid,

51
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,916
you totally nailed me.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,250
Your turn now!

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,166
My right hand is working!...

54
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,291
Damn!

55
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,208
Damn it.

56
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,000
What the hell is going on?

57
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,208
Who is he?

58
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,041
Heh... You're not very
used to losing, huh?

59
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,291
You bounce back every attack
that's thrown at you...

60
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,958
So you usually beat your
opponents quickly...

61
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:30,541
It's not surprising
that a guy like you

62
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,333
doesn't know his way
around a fist fight.

63
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,166
I wouldn't boast
if I were you...

64
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,541
Now I'm angry!

65
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:41,250
Uh-oh.

66
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,000
Ten thousand sisters.

67
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,208
They lived as
best they could.

68
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,208
They used up all
their strength...

69
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,875
just to fight you...

70
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,750
They gave every ounce of
life they had inside them.

71
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,916
That was the only purpose
they were ever given:

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,833
to wind up as fodder for a
ruthless bastard like you.

73
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:15,083
Oh really, they lived
as best they could?

74
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,750
They gave every ounce of
life they had inside them?

75
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,208
What are you
talking about?

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,041
Now die!

77
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,458
Aw, poor baby,
you fell down.

78
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,791
Did I hurt you?

79
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,083
Can't you see you'll
never beat me?

80
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,375
In the end you're
nothing but big talk...

81
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,291
It's too late to
run away, hero boy.

82
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,208
You'll be nothing but
a stain on the ground

83
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,250
by the time I'm
finished with you!

84
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,083
Compress it...
compress it...

85
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:18,041
Compress the air.

86
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,750
Wait a sec...

87
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,541
Hah...! That's it...!

88
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,416
I've just had a
fantastic idea!

89
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,875
Hey, what happened to
all that spunk you had?

90
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,250
I need you to stick with
me for a little longer here,

91
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,291
or this won't be
worth the effort.

92
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:32,666
Accelerator!

93
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't even think about it!

94
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,666
N-no.

95
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,375
You can't interfere... remember?

96
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,708
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,333
I really am...

98
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,791
I know you didn't want it
to wind up like this...

99
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,000
You wanted a
happy ending...

100
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,208
Where everybody's okay,
and no one loses anything...

101
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,875
but that just
isn't possible now.

102
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:11,958
So, again...

103
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,250
My reason for interfering
here might be selfish...

105
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,166
I know that.

106
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,500
But it doesn't
change the fact...

107
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,791
that I don't want you to
die tonight because of me.

108
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,250
No, Misaka!

109
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,208
Plasma?

110
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,958
He's controlling the
wind direction...

111
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,041
gathering it all
in one place...

112
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,291
And forming it into plasma.

113
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,125
Impossible.

114
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:07,208
I can't do anything
about that with my power.

115
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,750
If I could manipulate
the wind...

116
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,666
But that's beyond
my ability.

117
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,083
The wind!

118
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,458
From what I can tell,

119
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,416
Accelerator is forming
that sphere of plasma

120
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,916
by condensing the
wind around him.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
I see...

122
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,541
He has to take into
account the flow of the wind

123
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,500
in order to control
the plasma...

124
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,750
In which case...

125
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,583
You need to wake up...!

126
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,791
There's something important
I have to ask you to do.

127
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,708
It's something
only you can do!

128
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,416
I realize that I'm
asking a lot of you...

129
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,833
but will you please just
wake up and help me?

130
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,250
I'll never ask anything
of you again...

131
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:55,000
Please...! I can't protect
everyone by myself.

132
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,458
No matter how hard I try,
there's no way...

133
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,583
none at all...

134
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,958
You're my only hope.

135
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,916
Please, I'm begging you...!

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Get up and use your power,
not for me...

137
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,500
not for me, but for him!

138
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,416
"I'm not sure I understand
what you're saying.

139
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,291
But for some reason
I cannot explain,

140
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,583
your words have moved me...

141
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,666
So... I am happy to help you,"

142
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,208
Misaka answers.

143
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,208
Did I miscalculate
the wind somehow?

144
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,583
What...? How could this
be happening right now?

145
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:02,583
I know there were no glitches
in my calculations...

146
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:08,708
This is too irregular to
be any kind of natural wind.

147
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,708
Impossible.

148
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,833
Hold on... I've
heard about this...

149
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,375
Yeah, that's right...

150
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,583
It has something to do
with dynamo motors turning

151
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,375
when they're hit by particular
electromagnetic waves.

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,791
Damn you, you little punk.

153
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,125
I'll kill you.

154
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,291
You think I'm
going to let you?

155
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,875
Hah...! You're way out of
your league here, little girl,

156
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,250
and you know it...

157
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,791
If I wanna do something,
you can't stop me.

158
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,416
Visual acuity can only be
measured up to 20/20, right...?

159
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,791
My situation's like that...

160
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,125
Level 5 is the highest
rank an esper can attain

161
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,666
in Academy City...

162
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,666
So even though I'm better
than the rest of you,

163
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,708
I have to settle for that.

164
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,166
Stand down...

165
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,166
Right now.

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,416
Do you understand me...?..

167
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,166
Stand down... bastard.

168
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,666
You just won't quit.

169
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,458
I find that intriguing.

170
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,958
Let's finish this!

171
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,875
He's supposed to
be the strongest.

172
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,458
And I'm the weakest.

173
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,541
Let's see who's
the stronger one now!

174
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,416
What's happening?

175
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,666
W-w-w-what are you doing?

176
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,791
I mean... how did this most
fortuitous event come to pass

177
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:59,750
while I was sleeping...?...

178
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:00,958
I can't remember anything

179
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,416
that might have led
up to this situation.

180
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,791
"Just to set the record
straight, asleep or not,

181
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,041
you reached your
hand out toward me...

182
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
So... " Misaka then trails off.

183
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,250
You've gotta be kidding...

184
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,416
I swear, the anesthetic

185
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,458
is still in effect
from my neck down...

186
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,541
but apparently I'm so
pathetically frustrated

187
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll grope at a
girl's chest even

188
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,541
when I'm numb throughout
most of my body...!

189
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,083
I'm shameless and disgusting!

190
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,708
"Reaching out
for Misaka's hand

191
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:29,500
was the extent of your
involvement in this situation,"

192
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,500
Misaka explains because
you seem so distressed.

193
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,083
"Bringing your hand
up to this position

194
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,291
was something Misaka
did of her own will...

195
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,833
your actions are neither
shameless nor disgusting,"

196
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,625
Misaka offers reassuringly.

197
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,166
"Misaka was using the
flow of bioelectricity...

198
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,458
I needed to do so

199
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:47,791
in order to monitor your
brainwaves and pulse,"

200
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,958
says Misaka
explaining her actions.

201
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,083
Really...? Is it still there?

202
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,708
Is my hand still
on your chest?

203
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,125
Because of the anesthetic,

204
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,250
I still can't feel
anything at all.

205
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,375
I can't so much as
move a single finger.

206
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,125
That is just my damn luck!

207
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,041
"Misaka does not
understand...

208
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,958
Is there some abnormality
in your speech center?"

209
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,125
Misaka asks,
expressing worry.

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,708
Well...

211
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,000
looks like we all managed
to get out of there safely.

212
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,833
"It is not as
simple as that,"

213
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,041
Misaka begins her reply...

214
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,750
"Regrettably, Misaka is not yet
able to live a normal life

215
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,333
in Academy City,"

216
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:32,750
Misaka expands upon
her former statement.

217
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,875
You don't mean...

218
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,375
the experiment is still...

219
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,916
"No... that is not the case...

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,541
It seems that because of the
sound defeat of Accelerator,

221
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,541
the experiment is indeed
headed for cancellation...

222
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,208
Done," Misaka intones with a
note of finality in her voice.

223
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,958
"The current issue is
not the experiment...

224
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,000
The problem is
Misaka's body,"

225
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,375
Misaka begins
her explanation.

226
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,875
-Your body?
-"Yes...

227
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,750
Misaka's bodies are clones...

228
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,791
They were originally created
by using Sister's cells...

229
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,125
Following creation,

230
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,250
our bodies have been
stimulated for rapid growth

231
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,250
by the administration
of certain drugs,"

232
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,416
Misaka continues.

233
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,750
"By their very nature,

234
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,750
cellular clones have
a shorter lifespan

235
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,041
than normal humans.

236
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,625
Because of rapid growth,

237
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,791
ours have been cut
even shorter than that.

238
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,625
Does that make sense?"

239
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,791
Misaka asks.

240
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,125
"So, it is necessary for
the research facility

241
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,750
to take us in temporarily,

242
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,791
and adjust us each
individually...

243
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,208
Are you even listening?

244
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:33,208
Your face looks blank,"
Misaka asks, glowering.

245
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,666
Adjust you how?

246
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,250
"It's simple...

247
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,083
They'll perform a hormone
balancing procedure

248
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,583
for our rapid growth...

249
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,333
Also, they will adjust
the mitotic rate

250
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,083
of our cellular nuclei...

251
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,208
This will allow
our lifespans

252
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,375
to be restored
to some degree."

253
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,541
"Well... that's all,"
Misaka says.

254
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,083
I'll leave now.

255
00:16:57,416 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey, wait a second.

256
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,791
This "adjusting" stuff...

257
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,166
is it a cure?

258
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,250
"Do not worry...

259
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,208
I will see you
again soon...

260
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,083
Goodbye for tonight,"
Misaka says.

261
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,375
Okay...

262
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,625
there don't seem to be
any major problems...

263
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,041
but it does appear

264
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:36,166
that you have an unusual
fondness for hospital rooms.

265
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,833
Well... for the time being,

266
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
just get as much
rest as you can...

267
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,958
And I'll be back later.

268
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,000
Sounds good...
Thank you, Doctor.

269
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,083
So... you're awake.

270
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,750
Misaka... is that you?

271
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:14,916
Are you... one of the...

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,041
Here... Get well soon.

273
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,166
Oh... thank you.

274
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,916
I picked out the
most expensive ones

275
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
the department store had.

276
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,375
From the price,
I'm guessing

277
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,000
those are some
pretty good cookies.

278
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,708
Don't people always say homemade
cookies are the most tasty?

279
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,541
Oh, is that so...?

280
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,250
Can you seriously picture
me baking cookies?

281
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,416
No, never...

282
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,833
I imagine if you tried to,

283
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,583
you'd make a horrible
mess of the kitchen

284
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,541
and the cookies would all come
out misshapen and disgusting...

285
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,125
That's what you're
saying, right?

286
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,666
I meant baking's
not my style,

287
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,041
not that I couldn't do it!

288
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,166
Calm down!
I'm injured here!

289
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,541
Okay, fine.

290
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:53,875
Oh, yeah...

291
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,666
I meant to tell you that
your little sister came by

292
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,875
to see me earlier.

293
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,416
Did she?

294
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,750
Well, I'm heading home.

295
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,208
Hey, you know what?

296
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
If you had never offered
them your DNA map...

297
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,958
not a single one
of the sisters

298
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,750
would have ever existed
in the first place.

299
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,166
That experiment was messed
up in a lot of ways...

300
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,500
but at least there was something
good that came from it...

301
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:33,875
your sisters...

302
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,041
You can take
pride in that.

303
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,083
I can take pride, can I?

304
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,666
Even though ten
thousand of them

305
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,375
were mowed down
by Accelerator?

306
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,666
Yes, even so.

307
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,125
I'm sure that none of them
would blame you for it...

308
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,833
Think about it...

309
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:53,291
Without you, they wouldn't
have a chance at life at all.

310
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,750
So it's okay for you to let
yourself feel a little happy...

311
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,583
You know them much
better than I do.

312
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you think they're
the type of people

313
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,208
who would feel gratified by
somebody else's pain...?

314
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,875
'Cause that's not
the impression I got.

315
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,500
Right.

316
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,875
Well, Toma... Is there
something you'd like to say?

317
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,958
I, uh...

318
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,291
nice morning, isn't it?

319
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,958
Hey, lay off! I'm
seriously hurt this time!

320
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,541
I can't take this
kind of abuse!

321
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,083
I'm too fragile...!

322
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,541
Come on...! Show a little
concern for my health, will you?

323
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,250
I was concerned!

324
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,791
I really was...

325
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:12,041
very much.

326
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,708
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,250
Silly boy...

328
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,041
You keep taking all these
problems on alone...

329
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,875
You should learn how to turn
to others for help sometime...

330
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,041
If you can't manage that,

331
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,583
then you'll leave me
with no other choice

332
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,333
but to start giving you some
serious lectures on teamwork.

333
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,500
Oh well, dwelling on it
won't make things any better,

334
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,541
so we can just let it
go for now, okay...?

335
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,166
Tell me one thing, though...

336
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,750
What was it that you were
fighting for this time around?

337
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,583
I was fighting for myself.

338
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:32,125
[Music]

339
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:59,000
What's supposed to be a
family reunion on the beach

340
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:02,000
is violently interrupted
by a magical disturbance.

341
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,416
You've gotta be
kidding me...!

342
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,750
That's my mom?!

343
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,625
Next time, "Angel Fall."

344
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:08,458
When science and
magic cross paths,

345
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,125
a story is born.
