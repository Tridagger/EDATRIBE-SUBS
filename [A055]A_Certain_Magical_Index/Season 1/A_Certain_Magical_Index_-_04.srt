1
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:34,708
Apparently, the books
that Index memorized

2
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,791
contain magic so evil it
can poison the human mind.

3
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:41,916
That's the reason
she's being pursued.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,333
And yet... with all
she's facing,

5
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,666
she never asked me
to help her...

6
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:50,166
What now...?
What do I do now?

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:58,083
[Music]

8
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:05,458
Perfect Memory Ability"

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,791
There's no one here...

10
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,541
What's happening?

11
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:40,916
Runes.

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,791
I engraved them
around this spot

13
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:48,041
so we could have
a little privacy.

14
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:52,916
And who the hell are you?

15
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,125
Kaori Kanzaki and
I know who you are.

16
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,708
If possible... I
would like to avoid

17
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,250
giving you my magic name.

18
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,791
And why's that?

19
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,625
It's also my killer name.

20
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,166
So you're like
that other guy...

21
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,916
You're a sorceress.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
I'm not going to beat
around the bush...

23
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,458
I would like you to
hand over Index...

24
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,541
and I'd prefer to
avoid violence.

25
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,875
And if I refuse?

26
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,125
Then you'll leave
me no choice.

27
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,750
I will tell you my other
name and then take her.

28
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
I'll ask once again.

29
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,083
Are you going to hand
Index over to me...

30
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,041
or do I need to say the
name I've been withholding?

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,625
You think I'll
give in to you?

32
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,916
You think I'd
surrender her?

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,791
No, not to
someone like you.

34
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,833
I'll ask as many
times as I have to.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,625
With this sword, I wield
the Seven Flashes...

36
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,708
Do you know what
that means...?

37
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,958
I have the power
to kill you

38
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,958
seven times over in
the blink of an eye.

39
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,625
Certain death
is the reason

40
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,625
you should surrender
her to me.

41
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,083
Damn...

42
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,875
She's not exaggerating...

43
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,458
What now?

44
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,416
I still have this.

45
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,875
Stiyl has informed me
about your talent...

46
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,750
From what he tells me,
your right hand

47
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,791
can somehow render
magic ineffective.

48
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,250
But that got
me thinking...

49
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,416
What if you can't touch the
source of the magic...?

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,791
Then you're out of
luck, aren't you?

51
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,291
Now what...? Should
I try charging her?

52
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,125
Seven Flashes.

53
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,833
You're going to make me
keep asking aren't you?

54
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,583
You stubborn boy...

55
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,083
I don't understand why
you refuse to give in

56
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,666
when you know
what I can do.

57
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,791
Seven Flashes.

58
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,583
Damn you!

59
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,708
It's not working.

60
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,791
Ultra-thin wires?

61
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,333
She's been using the
movement of her sword

62
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,333
to distract me from
noticing them.

63
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,750
You're not using magic...

64
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,958
Maybe you aren't really
a sorceress after all.

65
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,791
Weren't you listening
earlier...?

66
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,250
Stiyl told me about your
sneaky little power.

67
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,958
So does that mean your
sword isn't a magic weapon?

68
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,250
Magic or not,

69
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,833
I don't carry it
around for decoration.

70
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,000
The Seven Flashes
come first...

71
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,083
but the ultimate attack,
Single Flash,

72
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,583
still awaits you...

73
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:01,791
and don't forget...

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,375
I haven't yet told
you my magic name.

75
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,708
And I truly hope you won't
make me say it, boy...

76
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,500
If it was my choice...

77
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,416
I would never give
that name out again.

78
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,375
What do I do?

79
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,791
Surrender?

80
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,125
I'm sorry what
did you say...?

81
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,166
Speak a little louder
I couldn't hear you.

82
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,208
Shut up.

83
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
I was telling you
to shut up...!

84
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,875
I will never surrender
to a heartless monster.

85
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,333
Seven Flashes.

86
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,208
Haven't you had
enough pain already?

87
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,791
You're willing to risk your
life to protect this girl...

88
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:02,958
What is she to you?

89
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,875
There's something
I wanna know.

90
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,958
Why am I still alive?

91
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,875
If you were gonna kill me,

92
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,875
you could've done it
a dozen times by now.

93
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,833
But you keep
holding back...

94
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,458
You're still human enough to
know right from wrong...

95
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,958
You aren't enjoying
this any more than I am.

96
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,458
You understand why
I'm doing this...

97
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:25,250
Index is an innocent girl,
and you attacked her...

98
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,666
You tore her up and
left her for dead...

99
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,375
You can't expect me...

100
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,708
to just let you
get away with it.

101
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,666
And that's not all...

102
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,875
Thanks to you and
your friends,

103
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,333
she lost her memory...

104
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,041
Did you know that?

105
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,875
What horrible things did
you have to do to her

106
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,333
to make something
like that happen?

107
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,458
I did try...

108
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,625
I have fought like hell
against you people...

109
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,625
but it wasn't enough...

110
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:50,916
I'm just a pathetic kid

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,083
who can't even save
a single young girl.

112
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,416
A weakling who can do nothing
but watch helplessly

113
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,750
while you drag her away to
do who knows what to her.

114
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,708
But you... you're
stronger than that.

115
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,750
You're no weakling
stuck on the sidelines.

116
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,208
With powers like yours,

117
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,000
you can do anything
you want to do...

118
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,291
You can protect anybody
who needs protecting...

119
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,958
but you choose not to!

120
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,333
You understand nothing.

121
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,041
Nothing at all...

122
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,666
I didn't have any choice.

123
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,375
I'm not doing this
because I want to.

124
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,958
I am only doing the work
that I am required to do...

125
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,375
by Necessarius.

126
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,375
Wait, I know that name...

127
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,666
It's the same branch of
the English church

128
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,458
Index belongs to.

129
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,208
She and I belong to the
same organization...

130
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,166
More importantly, she is
a very dear friend to me.

131
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,625
I know I injured
her badly,

132
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,000
but that was never
my intention.

133
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,333
It was an accident.

134
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,250
I didn't know...

135
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,750
I didn't realize the
Walking Church

136
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,625
had been compromised.

137
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,083
I wouldn't have
attacked so hard

138
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,291
if I'd known she would
get hurt like that...

139
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,708
Never.

140
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,250
Hold on a second...

141
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,333
if you're such good friends,

142
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,083
why would you be
attacking her at all?

143
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,333
I had to attack her in
order to protect her...

144
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,791
Without our help, she's
not going to live much longer.

145
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,166
It's because of her
photographic memory.

146
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,458
But why, what does that
have to do with anything?

147
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,666
It's the reason behind
all that has happened.

148
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:29,250
This is about her
perfect memory.

149
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:31,208
About those books she's
always describing.

150
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,750
She says they're
in her head--

151
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
that she always
carries them with her.

152
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,250
The capacity of the human
brain is surprisingly small.

153
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,958
So you forget...

154
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,083
You get rid of the
memories you don't need...

155
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,791
Doing so keeps your
brain from overloading.

156
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,291
Forgetting keeps
humans alive......

157
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,208
however... Index
cannot forget.

158
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,375
The number of leaves on
a tree-lined street...

159
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,416
The faces of people crowded
together during rush hour...

160
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,833
The shape of every raindrop
that falls from the sky.

161
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,625
It doesn't take long
before her brain

162
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,250
is so packed full
of trivial memories

163
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,333
that it can't function.

164
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,666
Wait a second...

165
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,416
Explain something.

166
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,416
You say that Index is part of
the same organization as you...

167
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,958
If so, why does
she describe

168
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,666
you and your friend as
evil sorcerers...?

169
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,208
It makes no sense...

170
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,250
or... are you saying that
Index has been lying to me

171
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,625
this whole time?

172
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,125
No. She is telling you what
she believes to be true.

173
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,875
But she doesn't know...

174
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:30,791
not that we all
work together

175
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,791
as members of Necessarius...

176
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,208
nor the actual reason that
we have to pursue her.

177
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,500
All of it has been
erased from her memory.

178
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,916
So she's just working with
what she does remember.

179
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,458
Her fears are not
unreasonable...

180
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,125
From what she knows, it
makes sense for her

181
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,500
to believe that a magic cabal

182
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,708
is after the library
of grimoires.

183
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,375
Hold on... I don't understand...

184
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,791
Index has a photographic
memory, right?

185
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,875
How is it possible for
someone with her ability

186
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,041
to forget everything that
happened before a year ago?

187
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,291
"Forgetting" isn't the
right way to describe it...

188
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,458
It's more accurate to say
we took her memories from her.

189
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,708
You erased her memory...

190
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:11,833
How is that possible?

191
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,666
You used magic... But
why do it at all?

192
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,833
You and Index were close.

193
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,791
You even belong to
the same church...

194
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
That's what you
said, isn't it?

195
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,083
You consider her a
very dear friend.

196
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,500
That's what you
told me...!

197
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,083
If it's true, how could
you do this to her?

198
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,791
Because I had no other
choice, that's why!

199
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,166
I do it because...

200
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,750
because unless I do,
my friend will die.

201
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,625
A full 85% of Index's
brain is used to store

202
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,958
the hundred and three
thousand grimoires...

203
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,041
As a result, she has
only 15% of her brain

204
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,750
remaining to control
day-to-day functions.

205
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,333
That 15% quickly fills
up with new memories,

206
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,416
and once it's full, her
brain will be overloaded.

207
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,708
That's terrifying, but...

208
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,541
Isn't there another
way to save her?

209
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,291
No, there isn't.

210
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,958
How much time does
she have left?

211
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,833
Index's memory
erasure is conducted

212
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,875
at precise yearly
intervals...

213
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,041
If we do not do it
at that exact time,

214
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,458
the erasure cannot occur.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,791
There are three
days remaining.

216
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,291
Only three?

217
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,750
Don't worry.

218
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,916
The procedure we perform
doesn't hurt her...

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,541
And as I've already
explained to you,

220
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,250
if we don't do it,
she will be lost.

221
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,791
So I'll ask you again:
will you turn Index over

222
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,375
to us without forcing me
to speak my magic name...?

223
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,208
If we battle,
you will lose,

224
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,833
and her memory will
still be erased...

225
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,041
She will have no
idea who you are

226
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,833
or what you have
done for her.

227
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,416
Fight me and your
sacrifice will mean nothing...

228
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,875
Trying to help her now is
ultimately an empty gesture.

229
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,708
What the hell do you know? !

230
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,208
It doesn't matter
whether or not

231
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:07,666
she remembers me
once this is over.

232
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,500
I'll explain since you
clearly don't get it.

233
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,458
I am truly Index's friend,
unlike you...!

234
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,750
Nothing you can say
will change my mind...

235
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,291
For better or worse,
I'm on her side,

236
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,208
and that's how
it's gonna stay...

237
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,000
every single thing you've
said since we started

238
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,416
talking has only
convinced me more.

239
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,541
I don't think you're
telling me everything...

240
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,666
Like why you left her
in the dark on this...

241
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,958
After stealing her memory,

242
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,833
couldn't you still explain
what was happening?

243
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,375
Why not at least try to
tell her what you're doing?

244
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,708
Instead you hunt her
down and frighten her.

245
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:36,833
When she needed
somebody the most,

246
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,666
you people abandoned her.

247
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,333
Some friend you
turned out to be!

248
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,750
Shut up, you ignorant
little maggot!

249
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,458
You know less
than nothing!

250
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,916
Do you think this is
something we enjoy...?

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,083
Stealing her memories over
and over and over again?

252
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,583
You look at Stiyl like he's some
monster from a nightmare...

253
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,666
Well, he's not...

254
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,291
You fight for her
as a friend,

255
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,083
while he must save her life
by pretending to be the enemy.

256
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,875
Do you have any idea
the toll it took on him

257
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,000
to confront you? !

258
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,291
You stay safely cocooned
in your self-righteous rage

259
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,833
while Stiyl
sacrifices everything

260
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,791
to save his friend...

261
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,833
What the hell gives you
the right to judge us? !

262
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,541
I've done
everything I can!

263
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,958
I've tried it all!

264
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,333
I once spent a full
year--spring, summer, fall,

265
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,625
winter--collecting
memories for her.

266
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,666
I wrote them all
down in a diary,

267
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,916
every detail
I could remember,

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,333
so she would remember, too.

269
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,583
I just wanted to give her
something to hold on to!

270
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,791
But it was no use...

271
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,500
It didn't work.

272
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,333
We watch her start
over every year...

273
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,541
creating new memories
with new people...

274
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,916
rebuilding the world that
we had to take away......

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,250
Only to have every one of those
new memories stolen again...

276
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,375
Knowing that it is
all because of us.

277
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166
We finally realized we
couldn't take it anymore.

278
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,000
We can't stand beside her,
knowing what we'll have to do.

279
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,625
It's too much to bear!

280
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,833
Don't give me that crap.

281
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,875
Poor you...

282
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,375
That's what this is about:
how much it hurts you.

283
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,333
I didn't hear anything
in your speech

284
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,208
about Index's feelings...

285
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,791
You're ashamed of what you
do and scared of getting hurt.

286
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,458
You let Index pay the
price for your cowardice.

287
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,333
You could tell her
the truth about

288
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,125
what has to be done to her.

289
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,291
Tell her she
won't be alone

290
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,666
and there's no
need to be scared,

291
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,833
because she can
make new memories.

292
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,458
Tell her that the
memories she creates

293
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,916
could be even happier than
the memories she's losing.

294
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:40,666
Do that...

295
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,875
and she wouldn't have to be
constantly on the run anymore...

296
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,250
It sounds like a simple
enough solution,

297
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,541
don't you think?

298
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,333
So why won't you do it?

299
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,625
What's the real reason you're
hiding everything from her...?

300
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:52,750
You say it's for her sake,

301
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,750
but I think that's a lie...!

302
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,416
You have the power
to help her,

303
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,166
but you keep her trapped
in the same cycle.

304
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,833
There has to be a reason
you haven't told me...

305
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,916
What are you really
afraid of...?

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,666
What are you really
trying to protect...?

307
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,041
What are you
really doing here?

308
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,625
You're so confident in your
strength as a sorceress,

309
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,916
but if you're so damn
powerful, then why...

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,625
Why can't you do
something, for... her....

311
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,208
Are we finished here?

312
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,250
Walk slower; I can't
keep up with you.

313
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,208
Geez, why're you in such
a hurry all the time?

314
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,875
Kuroko, are you
listening to yourself?

315
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:55,291
You're the one
always going on

316
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,333
about the importance
of sticking to curfew...

317
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,958
Well, if we get there late
it's not gonna be my fault!

318
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,375
Come on, please
wait for me!

319
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:04,875
What's going on here?

320
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,916
Wow, look at that.

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,958
That's a perfectly
smooth cut...

322
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,666
It could be a prank
pulled by some student

323
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,541
with pneumatic
control ability.

324
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,833
Yeah, sure... a prank.

325
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:17,791
It's a good thing
I'm here, then.

326
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,625
This is a job
for Judgment.

327
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,458
Get back here, Kuroko!

328
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,083
What am I supposed to do
with all these bags...?

329
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,416
Thanks a lot.

330
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,416
What are you looking at?
Is something the matter?

331
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,791
No, it's fine.

332
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,166
Are you awake, Toma?

333
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,625
Where am I?

334
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,500
Ow, that really hurt.

335
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,708
Be careful! You shouldn't
be getting out of bed yet.

336
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,791
The sun is up already,

337
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:10,000
so that must mean I
slept the whole night...

338
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,166
I don't remember
coming back here...

339
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,666
Hey, what time is it now?

340
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,083
You were out for more
than just one night.

341
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,708
Three whole days.

342
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,083
Really? That long...?..

343
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,416
What happened
that would keep me

344
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,833
unconscious
for three days?

345
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,458
There was something...

346
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,458
Index's memory
erasure is conducted

347
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,333
at precise yearly
intervals.

348
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,750
There are three
days remaining.

349
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,625
You got quiet all
of a sudden...

350
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,166
What's wrong?
Are you in pain?

351
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,750
Oh, no.

352
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,250
That's a good sign...

353
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,250
Index still
remembers me...

354
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,375
That must mean her memories
haven't been erased.

355
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,333
She doesn't seem to be
acting any differently...

356
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,291
So it can't have
happened yet.

357
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,666
It's all right then.

358
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,916
Nothing's all right!

359
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,791
It was horrible...

360
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,541
I didn't know what
happened to you.

361
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,333
Until Komoe told
me you had collapsed

362
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,375
in the middle of the road,

363
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,208
I had no idea
where you were...

364
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,916
She was the one
who found you,

365
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,458
battered and bruised
and unconscious,

366
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,000
and carried you back
here to the apartment.

367
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,250
But I had no clue what was
happening to you out there.

368
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,458
I didn't realize that you were
fighting another sorcerer...

369
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,375
that you were in
trouble because of me...

370
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,916
It's my fault.

371
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,250
It's all my fault...

372
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,458
I couldn't help you,
Toma. I'm so sorry!

373
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,916
What's the deal with
all these bandages?

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,250
I look like a mummy...

375
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,166
Don't you think that was
a little bit of overkill?

376
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,583
I figured the more I
bandaged you up,

377
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,750
the quicker you were
going to heal...

378
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,250
Of course, there's no way it'll
be as fast as using magic.

379
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,500
No, probably not...
but personally,

380
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:44,541
I'm just fine with letting
it heal the normal way.

381
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,750
Toma!

382
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,875
Unbelievable! After
everything that's happened,

383
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,791
you still don't believe
in magic, do you?

384
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,041
I swear you're the most
stubborn guy I've ever met!

385
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,791
Calm down. That
isn't what I meant.

386
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,583
It's not that
I don't believe...

387
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,041
I just don't like
seeing you that way.

388
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,583
It freaks me out when
that other personality

389
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,500
takes over your body.

390
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay... I understand.

391
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,583
But I'm awake now,
so it's all right.

392
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:07,916
What do you mean "awake"?

393
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,708
Well... When the
other voice takes over,

394
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,500
it's like I'm
talking in my sleep.

395
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,958
I sound all cold
and robotic.

396
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:18,625
John's Pen is useful when
I'm unconscious or badly hurt...

397
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,541
but it's still
kind of scary...

398
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,000
It's not me.

399
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,916
What I'm trying to
say is I can understand

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,833
why you don't wanna
see me like that...

401
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,166
I don't want
you to either.

402
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,875
I'm sorry, Index.

403
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,291
It's okay...

404
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,875
dummy.

405
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,500
Now, you should
eat something!

406
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,041
Um... I appreciate
it, but...

407
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,458
I'm not hungry.

408
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,000
Too bad... You have to eat
to regain your strength...

409
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,458
I'm a Sister. I know
how to care for the sick.

410
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,916
Yes... I know...

411
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,458
But right now I'd just
like some quiet time

412
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,000
to myself to, uh...

413
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,500
to meditate.

414
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,916
Is that so...? You don't
want the food I made? ...

415
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,125
Yes?

416
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,000
Maybe Komoe's back.

417
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,583
Excuse me... I live here.

418
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,625
Can I help you
with something?

419
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,625
Kamijo, Index,
are you there...?

420
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,875
I don't know
what's going on,

421
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,500
but you seem to have
some visitors out here.

422
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,416
You again! What are
you doing here? !

423
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,125
Looks like you're in
pretty bad shape...

424
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,666
I don't think you're
going to have much luck

425
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,000
running away
from me this time.

426
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,250
He's right...

427
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,500
Up until now, Index has
been staying ahead of them

428
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,041
fairly easily on her own.

429
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,083
But it'll be a different
story if she's saddled

430
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,958
with someone
who's badly injured.

431
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,041
That's why they
did this to me...

432
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,000
To make it easier
for them to catch her.

433
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,416
What now?

434
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,791
Go away!

435
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,625
Please, I'm
begging you...!

436
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,916
Leave him alone and
I'll go anywhere you want.

437
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,541
I'll do anything
you ask... anything!

438
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,833
Index, no!

439
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,208
Just take me...! I'm the
one you want, aren't I?

440
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,875
But I ask one thing:

441
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,625
I don't want you
hurting Toma anymore!

442
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:36,166
[Music]

443
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:46,166
[Music]

444
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:56,166
[Music]

445
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,500
[Music]

446
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,708
The ceremony that will
erase Index's memories

447
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,458
begins tonight
at twelve o'clock.

448
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,208
But I'm not giving up...

449
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,625
I swear I'll find
some way to save her!

450
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,125
Next time, "Limit."

451
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:09,375
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
