1
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,041
I don't understand how
everything got so screwed up...

2
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,833
I wanted to help her...

3
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,750
I didn't wanna fight.

4
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,583
I wanted to help.

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,000
That's it.

6
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:45,458
That's all there is to it.

7
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,375
Then you'll die.

8
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,958
There's no way you'll
survive this next attack...

9
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,000
Not if you stand there
and take it head-on.

10
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:21,250
[Music]

11
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,625
Utilization terrain at absolute
coordinates X-228561.

12
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:16,166
And Y-568714...

13
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,291
Commencing experiment
at 8:30 p.m.

14
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,000
Japan Standard Time...

15
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,666
Subject number 10032.

16
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,333
Test application.

17
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,541
How to cope in combat when
reflection is inapplicable.

18
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,083
That's fine.
But who are you?

19
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,875
That so...? Then what
are you doing here?

20
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,875
"I do not know.

21
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,416
I cannot
comprehend it."...

22
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,250
Well... That is
the answer Misaka

23
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,166
would have given
the strange young man.

24
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,250
I don't understand...

25
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,583
Why is it his face that
comes to Misaka's mind now?

26
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:56,250
RSPK Syndrome, known to
laymen as "poltergeisting"

27
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,833
refers to the
uncontrollable outburst

28
00:03:57,916 --> 00:03:59,166
of power from a person

29
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,291
who is no longer in
touch with reality...

30
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,333
It occurs as the result
of emotional trauma

31
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,833
or excessive stress.

32
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,041
Here in Academy City,
we conduct experiments

33
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,791
to develop students'
psychic abilities,

34
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,291
using various methods

35
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,708
to separate the
subjects from ordinary,

36
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,041
everyday reality.

37
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:15,833
Whatever the method used,

38
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,083
once separated from
conventional reality,

39
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,166
esper students create
a reality of their own,

40
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,041
one that is different
from everybody else's.

41
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,208
As a result, they obtain
their specific power,

42
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,791
one that operates on
principles different

43
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,291
from the rest of us.

44
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,250
Using that power, they are
able to warp the very fabric

45
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,041
of their own micro-world
by destroying things

46
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,375
without touching them,

47
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,125
predicting the future by
simply closing their eyes,

48
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,000
teleporting, and so on.

49
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,583
The ability development
program used in Academy City

50
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,666
is designed to create
alternate realities

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,958
by exposing students
to certain stimuli.

52
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,625
To put it simply, we use drugs
and the power of suggestion

53
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,916
to bring about a certain
change inside the brain

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,041
and encourage
reality creation.

55
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,500
The theory goes
that by assimilating

56
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,833
a certain curriculum,

57
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,083
anyone can
achieve an awakening

58
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,750
of their psychic
abilities...

59
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, almost
anyone, at least.

60
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:09,208
Because there are
still some students

61
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,250
who do not experience
that awakening...

62
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,875
Like Toma, for example.

63
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,625
That's right. Like Kamijo...

64
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,125
Though... in truth,

65
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,958
it's the type of
students like Kamijo

66
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:20,333
who are the most important
for us to study.

67
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh... so then you know
about Toma's power?

68
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:28,125
Yes, well, that Kamijo has
been a naughty little boy

69
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,291
ever since he enrolled
in classes here...

70
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,375
We've been through
quite a lot together...

71
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,000
quite a lot indeed.

72
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,125
-Another one?
-That stupid jerk.

73
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,708
The fact that
Level Zeroes exist

74
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,125
means that there
are still principles

75
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,291
that we do not
fully understand,

76
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,333
and knowing that may
prove very useful to us...

77
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
If we can learn more
about those principles,

78
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,875
they may be the key that
will help us find SYSTEM.

79
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,375
Basically, SYSTEM refers
to one who arrives

80
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,750
at the knowledge of God
while in a mortal body...

81
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,625
Humans can't understand the
whole of the world's truth.

82
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,416
It's assumed that no
mortal can do so...

83
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,458
but, if someone were to
be found or created whose

84
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,333
body was beyond human,

85
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,541
perhaps they would be able to
obtain the divine knowledge

86
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,958
that is beyond
the rest of us.

87
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,750
Obtaining knowledge
of God's truth, huh?

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,208
My hand... feels weird.

89
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,583
Must've been knocked
unconscious...

90
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,416
But I can't remember how.

91
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,541
Oh... that's right.

92
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,291
Why are you doing this...?

93
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,625
You're crazy.

94
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,750
You look like you're
about to fall apart...

95
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,083
battered and bruised and
lying on the filthy ground.

96
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,958
I think your heart may
even have stopped

97
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,625
for a second there.

98
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,541
Now this...

99
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,375
How can you smile after
everything that's happened?

100
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,666
Because I have an idea.

101
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,541
A way to force them to
stop the experiment...

102
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,958
I've finally got it.

103
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,875
It's actually pretty simple
when you think about it.

104
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,833
Tree diagram would've
programmed the experiment

105
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,625
with the presupposition
that Accelerator

106
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,583
was the strongest esper
in Academy City, right?

107
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,916
Well... what if
it was wrong...?

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,541
What if the
mighty Accelerator

109
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,958
was beaten
easily in a fight

110
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,458
with somebody who's supposed
to be weaker than he is?

111
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,416
No researcher would
continue an experiment

112
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,166
when the basic premise
was proven flawed.

113
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,666
It's so simple...

114
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,708
We just have to convince
the researchers of one thing...

115
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,166
That they were wrong
about Accelerator.

116
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,125
That he's actually
incredibly weak.

117
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,041
Don't you see
that's impossible?

118
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,791
There's no way that
could happen...

119
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:03,208
I've only come
face-to-face

120
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,583
with Accelerator one time,
but that doesn't matter...

121
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,375
I can tell.

122
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,833
A fight with him isn't a
question of who's going to win

123
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,791
and who's going to lose.

124
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,083
It's a question of how
much punishment

125
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,916
he wants to dish out.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,958
And how much time he wants
to take carving up his opponent.

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,791
Besides, don't forget,
I'm a Level 5,

128
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,166
like Accelerator is...

129
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,666
Even if by some miracle,
I did defeat him...

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,833
the researchers would
write it off as an anomaly

131
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,541
that's within the
acceptable margin of error.

132
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,416
They wouldn't scrap the
experiment because of that...

133
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,625
They wouldn't believe
he was truly weaker.

134
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,541
In that case...

135
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
I suppose I'll have to be
the one who fights him.

136
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,708
What if Academy City's
strongest Level 5...

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Was handily defeated in a
fight with Academy City's

138
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,125
weakest Level Zero?

139
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,458
You can't be serious!
It's impossible.

140
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,041
You don't understand how
powerful Accelerator is...!

141
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,000
We're talking
about a guy so strong

142
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,333
he wouldn't even
break a sweat

143
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,458
if he had to defend himself
from an entire army,

144
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,583
and now you want to
fight him head-to-head? !

145
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,500
He can manipulate
kinetic momentum,

146
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,541
thermal quantity,
electric charge,

147
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,000
and any other kind of vector

148
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,583
with nothing
more than a touch.

149
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,458
Any attack you made would
fail to reach him...

150
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,875
He'll just send them all
bouncing back at you!

151
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,875
You would have to be crazy
to take on someone

152
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,166
with that kind of power

153
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,083
and not a single shred
of sportsmanship...!

154
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,708
Especially considering
the shape that you're in!

155
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,708
You'd have no chance
on a good day,

156
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,333
much less as you
are right now!

157
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,083
Don't go.

158
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,375
When I ran into you...

159
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,083
you were on your way to
find Accelerator, weren't you?

160
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,958
So tell me.

161
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:56,875
Tell me where
I can find him.

162
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,333
The time is 8:25
by my clock.

163
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:09,083
You're a few
minutes early.

164
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,708
So... I'm assuming
you have no objection

165
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,541
to being my next target
for this experiment?

166
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:19,541
"No... I am Misaka,
serial number 10032,"...

167
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,875
Misaka identifies herself.

168
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,791
"Before we begin, wouldn't
it be wise for you

169
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,166
to verify my password

170
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,208
to make sure I am part
of the experiment?"

171
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,416
Misaka responsibly advises.

172
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,708
Honestly...

173
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,500
I hate to question you
when you're so diligently

174
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,041
performing your role
in an experiment

175
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,833
to increase my strength...

176
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,416
but you strike me as
unnaturally relaxed...

177
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,833
given the situation.

178
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,250
You sure your mind isn't
occupied with something else?

179
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,833
"The phrase 'something else'

180
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,375
is too vague for me
to fully comprehend,"

181
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,875
Misaka replies in
some confusion.

182
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,833
"Three minutes and
twenty seconds remain

183
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,750
until the experiment
is scheduled to begin.

184
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,208
Are you ready?"...

185
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,166
Misaka inquires,
seeking confirmation.

186
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,666
I don't think
I'll ever understand

187
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,125
how you can be so willing
to throw your life away.

188
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,666
My life is more
important to me

189
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,458
than anything else
in the world...

190
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,458
Which is why my
desire for greater power

191
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,416
will never dissipate
or diminish...

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,000
So it doesn't matter if
I've killed ten

193
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,083
or ten thousand in
this experiment.

194
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,583
As long as I'm
getting stronger,

195
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:13,958
your deaths are nothing to me.

196
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,583
I'll laugh away each kill.

197
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,375
"You say you cannot
understand Misaka,

198
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,208
but Misaka also finds your
behavior confusing,"...

199
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,000
Misaka replies honestly.

200
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,333
"You are already the
strongest Level 5

201
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,208
in Academy City...

202
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,375
You are in a position where
nobody else can touch you...

203
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,166
so there is no need for you
to become more powerful,"...

204
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,666
Misaka states reasonably.

205
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,750
The strongest, huh?

206
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,416
Yeah, that's true...

207
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,791
but how have people arrived
at that evaluation of me...?

208
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
They named me the
strongest Level 5

209
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,416
because they actually
fought me and got beat.

210
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,916
That's the basis for my
classification right there.

211
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,083
I'm at the top of the heap
because a bunch of dimwits

212
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,375
thought to themselves,

213
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,250
"Hey, I think I'll pick
a fight with that guy.

214
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,166
It'll be fun to see
what he can really do!"

215
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, that's not
good enough...

216
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,875
It's not even
that close...

217
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,791
I've got bigger
plans for myself.

218
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:03,250
That level of power
is insignificant!

219
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,208
The power I'm after goes
a step beyond that...

220
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,041
I don't want people
thinking that fighting me

221
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,083
would be an
interesting challenge.

222
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,083
I want the very idea of
going up against me

223
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,208
to be unthinkable, something
that nobody would dare!

224
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,750
"One minute thirty seconds until
the experiment commences...

225
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you certain that
you are ready to begin?"

226
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,166
Misaka asks, again
seeking confirmation.

227
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,208
I thought we might
be able to kill

228
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:29,166
a little time before
we got to it...

229
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,416
but this is just hopeless.

230
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,833
There's no point in
trying to hold

231
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,333
a normal conversation
with you.

232
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,916
Okay then, are
you ready...?

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
It's almost time
for you to die...

234
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,541
you substandard
factory reject.

235
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,833
"The time is 8:29
and 45 seconds...

236
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,583
We will now commence
trial number 10032."

237
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,791
"Will test subject Accelerator
please take his position?"

238
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,041
Misaka instructs politely.

239
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,875
The industrial district
on the west end.

240
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,666
Find the train
yard there...

241
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,041
That's the location of

242
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,000
the ten thousand and
thirty-second testing site.

243
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,583
"Up to now, you have had
contact with one Misaka...

244
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,750
Serial number 10032.

245
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,291
I am that Misaka."

246
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,541
What's the matter, buddy?

247
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,791
Oh, of course...

248
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,166
It's the electromagnetic
waves from my body.

249
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,958
This is insane.

250
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,250
If you really
wanna help them,

251
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,041
you have to let
me try my idea.

252
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,125
The important thing is
for me, a Level Zero,

253
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,291
to defeat Accelerator without
assistance from anybody else...

254
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,541
If I have a Level 5
fighting alongside me,

255
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,666
then it won't
mean anything.

256
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,708
Don't worry.

257
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:08,458
No matter what, I'll
bring her back with me.

258
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,250
It's not like
I don't get it.

259
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,000
If I were to go
to the train yard,

260
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,166
I wouldn't be able to do
anything to help out...

261
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,625
Still... Does he really think
I can just stay here? !

262
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:55,875
What is the point of
all this running around?

263
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,291
It doesn't matter how much
time you buy for yourself.

264
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,958
No miracle is gonna
come along and save you.

265
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,500
Have you noticed?

266
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,416
Tonight the wind is at
zero miles per hour.

267
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,208
What's that smell?

268
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,041
Hah...! So that's it.

269
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,125
You're breaking down the
oxygen with electricity

270
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,541
and turning it into ozone.

271
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,833
If you take away my air,
maybe I'll pass out--

272
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,916
is that the idea?

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,208
That's very good...!
You clever little thing!

274
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,666
You're really going to
give me a run for my money!

275
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,000
I like this
turn of events,

276
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,875
I guess after ten thousand
of you were killed off,

277
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,125
you were bound to start getting
a little bit crafty, huh?

278
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,625
There is something you
should keep in mind, though.

279
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,750
Once I catch you, this
cute little tactic of yours

280
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,125
is going to
fail spectacularly.

281
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,458
You look rather surprised
to see me. It was simple.

282
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,708
All I did was change the
vector of kinetic momentum

283
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,000
underneath my feet.

284
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,708
Hey... Do you know how
you can hit your opponent

285
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:19,875
without doing any harm
to your own hands?

286
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,125
It's easy.

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,791
Change the direction
of kinetic momentum...

288
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,333
Just direct the
vector at your opponent

289
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,666
the second
that you touch her.

290
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,125
Of course, the
damage she takes

291
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,083
does increase by
a factor of that.

292
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,208
So...

293
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,375
What happens to the experiment
in a situation like this?

294
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,583
I'll tell you what
happens... You step away.

295
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,625
Get away from the
sister right now.

296
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,375
Hey, what's the
big idea...?

297
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:05,208
You inviting members of the
public to our testing sites now?

298
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,666
Well, damn...

299
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,791
This is irritating....

300
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,916
I didn't budget any time
for silencing outsiders

301
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,375
who discovered
our secret.

302
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:14,916
Stop talking and move.

303
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,000
Why the hell are you
still standing there?

304
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,250
I thought I told you
to get away from her.

305
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,333
You damn loser!

306
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,958
You must have a pair on
you, talking like that...

307
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,208
We have only seven Level
5 espers in Academy City,

308
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,666
and I'm undeniably
the most powerful one.

309
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,083
Yet you're standing
there calling me a loser?

310
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,208
Okay... You've got guts.

311
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,416
Well then...

312
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,541
I have to admit, 
I find you intriguing.

313
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,541
"What is this?"

314
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,916
"What in the world
are you doing here?"

315
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,000
Misaka asks
in utter shock.

316
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,375
You aren't her.
You're the kid sister...

317
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,333
You know... you sure
look a lot like Mikoto.

318
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,416
Hi again...

319
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,541
Thanks for helping
with the drinks

320
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,125
and the fleas yesterday.

321
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,208
You're the one
who found him.

322
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:24,583
So shouldn't you be the one
who gets to give him a name?

323
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,750
"Misaka is uncertain about
your state of mind

324
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,041
and why you have come here."

325
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,416
"Why would you take such a
risk for somebody like Misaka?

326
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,708
As you have been informed,

327
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,041
reproductions of this
body can be made,

328
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,875
so why are you here?"
Misaka repeats.

329
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,125
"Misakas can be
automatically manufactured

330
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,583
with no more effort than
the push of a single button."

331
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,750
"The bodies are
fabricated...

332
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,000
stocked with
borrowed minds...

333
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,458
This process has
been successfully

334
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,541
completed many times

335
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,416
Stop talking.

336
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,625
I don't care
about the fact

337
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,333
that you can
be manufactured.

338
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,416
And I have a very good
reason for being here:

339
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,041
I'm rescuing you.

340
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,166
There's only one of you
in the whole world, right?

341
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,166
Sorry... but you're
not dying today...

342
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,416
I'm afraid you've still
got a whole mountain

343
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,125
of accounts to settle...

344
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,958
I'm gonna help you
out of this situation.

345
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,083
You just keep
quiet and watch.

346
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,125
Very impressive...
a heroic speech.

347
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,666
Tell me, did you
just come up with that,

348
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,250
or have you been practicing?

349
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,500
However, you
must've realized

350
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,708
that there's a slight
problem with your plan

351
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
or did you forget
that I'm here?

352
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,666
Man, you're slow.

353
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,416
Is that the
best you can do?

354
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,583
If so, you don't stand a
chance in hell of beating me.

355
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,125
Come on...! Try!

356
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,583
Still so slow...

357
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,375
Yeah, far too
slow to beat me.

358
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,291
This would be a lot more
entertaining for me

359
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:20,958
if you were to put up
more of a struggle.

360
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,666
Don't just stand
there like a pig

361
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,375
waiting to be slaughtered.

362
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,458
Well, this is boring.

363
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,166
All right, then.

364
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,250
I think it's about time
we put an end to this.

365
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,958
What? !

366
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,583
Apparently there was flour
inside that container.

367
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:35,916
And there's no wind
tonight, either.

368
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,791
That could turn this into
a more dangerous situation

369
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
that I had anticipated.

370
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,250
Dangerous indeed...

371
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,500
There's quite a lot of
powder floating in the air now.

372
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:46,125
What if someone happened to
start a fire out here...?

373
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:49,041
The oxygen's rate of
combustion would be very fast.

374
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,833
Things could get
out of control.

375
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,208
Hey, tell me something...

376
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,666
Have you ever heard
of a certain phenomenon

377
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,916
known as a dust explosion?

378
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,708
They can be quite
devastating.

379
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:38,208
[Music]

380
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,458
There's only one
of you in the world,

381
00:23:58,541 --> 00:23:59,958
but what can I
do for you...?

382
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:03,416
I'm so weak I can't even get
near someone like him.

383
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,166
Next time,
"Weakest vs. Strongest."

384
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,000
When science and
magic cross paths,

385
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,458
a story is born.
