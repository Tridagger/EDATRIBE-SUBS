[AOGAMI]
Bad news!

3
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,625
The school store is
all sold out of bread!

4
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,583
And the cafeteria is packed!

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,833
We're too late.
How could this happen?

6
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,208
Um...

7
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,875
It's my fault for asking the
teacher a dumb question.

8
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,041
We must act.

9
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:49,875
Or we'll have to
endure afternoon classes

10
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,083
with empty stomachs.

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,250
[AOGAMI]
We can't!

12
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,916
We're still growing
boys and girls

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,458
in need of nourishment!

14
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,083
That would just be cruel!

15
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,333
[STUDENT 07A]
What now?

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:00:59,875
[STUDENT 07B]
We get food from someplace else.

17
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:00,708
[STUDENT 07C]
But...

18
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,166
Do we dare?

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,958
It's the only way.

20
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,208
All right, everyone!

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,166
Make a break for
the convenience store!

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,375
[CLASSMATES]
Yeah!

23
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,166
[FUKIYOSE]
Let's keep our numbers down.

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,958
If we all leave school at once,
the teachers will notice.

25
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:16,791
We need to be quiet,
and we need to be quick.

26
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:19,250
This operation is a
race against the clock.

27
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,583
[KAMIJO]
That's for sure.

28
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,041
If they're already sold out of
lunches when we get there,

29
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,458
then all of this is
for nothing, right?

It's up to you. Good luck!

We're the only ones left!

Saigo?

37
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,125
I bet he's not forced
to go hungry!

38
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,541
Let it go, Kami!

39
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:47,625
If he catches us now,
it'll mean everyone's lunches!

40
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:48,666
Oh, crap!

41
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,458
Sorry. I'm going.

He's coming!

47
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,166
Our best bet's to split up.

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,708
[KAMIJO]
Uh... Right!

49
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh, of course
he comes after me!

00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,625
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

51
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,125
No, you don't!

52
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,083
[KAMIJO]
Wait! No!

53
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,916
Hold on a second, Itsuwa!

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,958
[ITSUWA]
Huh?

55
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,500
[ITSUWA]
I really am sorry!

56
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,500
I thought it was a
Roman Orthodox plot.

57
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,708
Oh. No, it's okay.

58
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,916
Saigo's really tough.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,458
They say he once
caught a giant boulder

60
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,875
with his bare hands.

61
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,291
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

62
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,666
[ITSUWA]
Well, that's good.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,666
But still, could I have
been any more useless?

64
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,708
Hey, you were totally useful.

65
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,958
[KAMIJO] So, what brings
you here, anyway?

66
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,041
[ITSUWA]
Huh? Oh.

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,875
[KAMIJO]
Hey, what are you doing?

68
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,208
Okay.

69
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,125
Tell me, does the name
Acqua of the Rear

70
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,875
sound familiar to you at all?

71
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,291
Uh, yeah.
He's with the Right Seat of God.

72
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:34,833
I think.

73
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,708
I met him when I was
fighting that Vento woman.

74
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,291
You see, the thing is,
he's issued a challenge

75
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,666
to the English Puritan Church,
and to Academy City, too.

76
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,000
[KAMIJO]
What kind of challenge?

77
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,208
In the next few days,
he's going to pulver--

78
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,958
I mean, stage an
attack on Toma Kamijo.

79
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,541
What? But why me?

80
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,541
[ITSUWA]
Isn't it obvious?

81
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,291
You're responsible for thwarting
the Roman Orthodox Church's

82
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:59,791
darkest schemes,
over and over again!

83
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,958
You're making it
sound bigger than it is.

84
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,875
Come on. I'm a high schooler.

85
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,583
[KAMIJO]
Honestly.

86
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,125
First there was
the front, then the left,

87
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,416
and now the rear, too?

88
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,791
Are they ever gonna
give it a rest?

89
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,333
Well, if they're targeting me,

90
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,000
then they must have too much
free time on their hands.

91
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:18,958
According to the report,
he's extremely dangerous.

92
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,875
He's also said to
possess saintly powers.

93
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,125
Um, okay.

94
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,875
[ITSUWA] But you have
nothing to worry about.

95
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,833
Even if Acqua were to attack,

96
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,750
I promise your life
wouldn't be in danger!

97
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,083
So, why exactly are you here?

98
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,208
To save you!

99
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm your bodyguard now.

100
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,375
Night and day!

101
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,666
[USHIBUKA]
Damn it, Itsuwa.

102
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,666
She's got the perfect
opportunity to go on the attack,

103
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,333
and it's all "business this"
and "business that."

104
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,000
Not only is it a shameful waste,

105
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,833
it looks like she's not
even aware of the weapons

106
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:47,916
she's packing.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,875
[KOUYAGI]
What do you mean, weapons?

108
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,625
Why, I'm referring to

109
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,625
the "Undercover Bra
Busters Theory"!

110
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,833
Interesting hypothesis,
Your Holiness,

111
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,458
but is there any basis for it?

112
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,291
[ISAHAYA] If you're just
making random predictions,

113
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,166
then you're better off saving
them for the horse races.

114
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,583
[chuckles] The "Itsuwa
Massage Operation"

115
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,500
that I conducted yielded
promising results,

116
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,708
and I believe you'll agree
they support my theory.

117
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,083
Her shoulder stiffness
index was forty.

118
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,291
However, factoring in
clothing and equipment

119
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,333
to calculate the load
on her shoulders,

120
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,333
a stiffness index
greater than thirty-seven

121
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,375
can only be explained
by one thing!

122
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,041
So you mean...

123
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
Yes. Something's
causing that stiffness.

124
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,458
And thus, my "Undercover
Bra Buster Theory"

125
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:29,500
is proven.

126
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,541
[USHIBUKA]
Huh?!

127
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,375
[TSUSHIMA sighs]

128
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,708
That said, however,

129
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,333
if I wish to explore
this theory to the fullest,

130
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,208
I'm going to need a new tactic.

131
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,958
[KOUYAGI] But you know Itsuwa,
she's never gonna make

132
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,666
the first move.

133
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,208
Which is why I've come up
with a super-secret plan.

134
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,666
Are you ready?

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,541
I call it "Operation Field
Sharpshooter Free Kick"!

136
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,875
[MIKOTO]
I can't believe he has amnesia.

137
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,333
For how long now?

138
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,416
What the--?

139
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,416
[KAMIJO yells]

140
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,458
[ITSUWA gasps]

[GROUP cheers]

142
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,791
[MIKOTO]
Listen up.

143
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,958
I've got enough unpleasant
stuff on my mind already.

144
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,333
I don't need any additional
stress right now, okay?

145
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,916
They're gone?

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,958
[ITSUWA]
Um, are you all right?

147
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,791
[KAMIJO]
Yeah, I think so.

148
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,333
Just a little dazed is all.

149
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,833
Really? Come on!

150
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,250
Oh, Misaka.

151
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,083
[MIKOTO] How long were you
planning to keep your face

152
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,833
buried in there,
you disgusting pig?

153
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,166
Get back!

154
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,750
[KAMIJO]
No! Stop! Let's go!

155
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,875
Hey! I'm not done with you yet!

156
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,333
Toma...!

157
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,333
You wanna tell me what
you're doing with Itsuwa

158
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,791
of the Amakusa Church?

159
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:57,791
[KAMIJO]
Oh, um...

160
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,000
The thing is, well...

161
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,500
What's the best way
for me to explain this?

162
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,916
There's a problem.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,208
The Right Seat of God is after--

164
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,583
[KAMIJO yells]

165
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,333
Look, I'm the one who
Acqua's going after, right?

166
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:11,541
So we don't really need
to tell Index, do we?

167
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,500
Itsuwa?

168
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes, I heard you!

169
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,666
Loud and clear, don't worry.

170
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
Oh, sorry.

171
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:18,000
That hurt?

172
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,083
[ITSUWA]
N-No.

173
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
It's fine.

174
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,041
[KAMIJO gasps]

175
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,791
[KAMIJO]
What the hell is going on here?

176
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,041
Is there some kind of

Hey, Index. Can you hear me?

I'm not really sure
what's happening,

me before you explode?

If you bleed off some of
your anger little by little,

the chances of my head

Yes. I may be here
acting as your bodyguard,

just help myself to your food.

00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,916
It wasn't like I planned it.

351
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,791
[MIKOTO] I wonder if
either of those girls know

352
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,708
about that idiot
and his amnesia.

353
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,250
I mean, he'd probably tell
them sooner than he'd tell me.

354
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,458
Not that I care
one way or the other!

355
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,083
Why am I getting so
upset about somebody

356
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,875
so obnoxious?

357
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,708
[sighs] He really is nothing
but a nuisance.

358
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,458
[INDEX] Uh-oh, looks like the
short-haired one is going under.

359
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,625
We have to save her!

360
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:29,666
Aw, man. that's really hot.

361
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,416
I should've gone
with iced coffee.

362
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,333
[ITSUWA]
Enjoying the evening breeze?

363
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,666
It's nice, huh?

364
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,791
[KAMIJO] It's so easy to
forget you're underground.

365
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,458
In that case, do you
want to take a little walk?

366
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,416
[KAMIJO] Sure. Wait...
But what about Index?

367
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,291
[ITSUWA] Last I saw
she was running around

368
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,291
in the all-you-can-eat section.

369
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,666
She was?

370
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,083
Well, then I guess we
don't have to worry

371
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,583
about losing her.

372
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,750
You know, this really
is an amazing place.

373
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,291
How many times have
you been here before?

374
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,666
This is her big chance.

375
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,208
There's definitely
a nice mood happening.

376
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,833
Well, Your Holiness.

377
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,250
What do you wanna do now?

378
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:05,666
What? About the
evening date operation?

379
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,166
No. I mean about
Acqua of the Rear.

380
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,708
Oh.

381
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,875
We've received reports about
him from Academy City, but...

382
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:17,041
[USHIBUKA]
I know. It's hard to believe.

383
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,833
It would be strange
for all three factions

384
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,333
to be scrambling.

385
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,458
And over someone like Toma
Kamijo, you know what I mean?

386
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,000
I get the feeling there
must be some information

387
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,583
that we're still unaware of.

388
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,833
[USHIBUKA]
In other words,

389
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,958
if we're serious about
protecting this guy...

390
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,541
Then yeah.

391
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,833
Chances are good we've still got
some investigating left to do.

392
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,666
[TATEMIYA]
The streets have been cleared.

393
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,375
How could I have
let this happen?

394
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,916
I'm pretty sure we've been had.

395
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,041
[KAMIJO]
I was wondering...

396
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,791
Where are the rest
of the Amakusa folks?

397
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,750
[ITSUWA] You may not be
able to see them right now,

398
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,916
but they're there.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,083
Most likely watching
us from a distance.

400
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,416
It's too bad the priestess
couldn't be here.

401
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,708
It would be like having a
one-woman army on our side.

402
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,208
[KAMIJO] Oh, yeah? Kanzaki's
really that incredible?

403
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,666
[ITSUWA]
Of course she is!

404
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,583
She's one of not even twenty
saints in the whole world!

405
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:11,833
Any trouble you may have,

406
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,666
the priestess can
resolve instantly!

407
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,583
Oh, really? That's impressive.

408
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,166
Well, I guess she did
fight that archangel--

409
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,750
you know, the Power of God.

410
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,291
[ITSUWA]
She fought an archangel?!

411
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:32,000
[ITSUWA] I know that I'm not
supposed to let my guard down,

412
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,166
but I just...

413
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,458
[KAMIJO]
Itsuwa? Is something wrong?

414
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,541
No! Nothing!

415
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,791
I mean, everything's
fine, really!

416
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,916
I was just noticing that
there don't seem to be

417
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,541
very many people around.

418
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,666
And would you just look
at that beautiful view!

419
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
[KAMIJO]
Yeah, I know.

420
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,416
This is what Academy City
looks like at night.

421
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,041
It feels a whole
lot more deserted

422
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,916
than it should be, though.

423
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hey...

424
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,583
[ITSUWA, KAMIJO gasp]

425
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
[ACQUA]
I gave you a warning.

426
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,791
You had plenty of time
and a number of options

427
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:02,833
before you.

428
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,625
And yet, this is
the path you chose.

429
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,833
The one you decided it was
worth risking your life on.

430
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,583
[ITSUWA]
Isn't that...

431
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,291
It's Tatemiya's!

432
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,500
[ACQUA]
I truly want to know.

433
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,208
Were you honestly incapable of
finding a better alternative

434
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,916
--than this?
--It's Acqua!

435
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:26,833
[ITSUWA gasps]

436
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,791
[KAMIJO]
Itsuwa!

437
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,291
[ACQUA]
Our world is being disrupted.

438
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,208
I've come to eliminate the
source of the disturbance.

439
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,208
Is now the best time
for you to be concerned

440
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,875
about others?

441
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,000
[KAMIJO yells]

442
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,958
[ACQUA] Do you honestly
believe one of you

443
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,666
has the ability to
challenge me and win

444
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,916
when your entire organization
combined could not?

445
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,500
I still have my pride.

446
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:56,833
I must fight!

447
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,208
[ITSUWA yells]

448
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,416
--[KAMIJO] Itsuwa!
--[ACQUA] Your right arm.

449
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,666
If you will offer it to me,

450
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll let you leave this
place with your life.

451
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,625
No, screw that!

452
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,833
I see.

453
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,750
Well, in that case,

454
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,791
I'll have to give you
a little more insight

455
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,708
into the reality of things.

456
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,500
[ITSUWA]
Kamijo!

457
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:38,833
Hold on!

458
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,458
Please stay with me!

459
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,375
I'll heal you with my
restoration magic!

460
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,500
[ITSUWA]
It isn't working.

461
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,666
Are you finished yet?

462
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,625
Hmm. I guess not.

463
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,416
I'll have to crush
you both together.

464
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,708
[KAMIJO]
Thank you, Itsuwa.

465
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:25,625
Because of your
restoration magic...

466
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,958
...I'm starting to feel
a little bit better now.

467
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:30,958
Please don't!

468
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,125
[KAMIJO yelling]

469
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,416
I admire your courage.

470
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,458
[KAMIJO yells]

471
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,875
[ACQUA]
I'll give you one day.

472
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,166
You may take that time to
consider my earlier proposition.

473
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,083
Cut off your own right
arm and deliver it to us.

474
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,333
If you do that,
I will let you live.

475
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,750
I'll wait for one day.

476
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,583
[KAMIJO] Saintly power
shakes the world's surface,

477
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,125
thundering to the lower levels.

478
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,666
After everything is plucked
apart and strength is used up,

479
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,791
what sort of strike
does Itsuwa make?

480
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:07,500
Next time, "Saint Breakout."

481
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,416
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
