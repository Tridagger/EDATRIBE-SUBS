assumed by now

that pilots carry weapons.

to be worried about, though.

[HAMAZURA] Got it.
It's going to be all right.

No! Please don't!

You have to stay away.

If you come barging in now,

them on your own.

You can charge me

me into the pits of Hell.

You should've said that sooner.

I've been hijacked.

57
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,458
The culprit is carrying a gun.

58
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,333
He's also got a small metal
drum filled with liquid.

59
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,875
Out of regard for the
lives of local residents,

60
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,333
I'm going to do what
he has asked of me.

61
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,916
But why?

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,666
I can't just say I'm
going off-route because

63
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,375
some kid insisted.

64
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:04,083
And I should warn you, they're
not going to let us land.

I know.

What's that?

An imitation tree, of course.

68
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,541
Having a real tree here would
hamper takeoffs and landings.

I have an opinion from
a magic perspective.

185
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,375
Typically when you hear
the word "dragon,"

186
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,666
it evokes a certain imagery
of religious metaphors.

187
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,416
Like angels, for example.

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,375

The name of the virus
that bastard Kihara

193
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,875
Perhaps "Angel" and "DRAGON"
are tied together somehow.

194

DRAGON is connected
to Last Order!

there's something more

It's that Shiokishi bastard.

199
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,500
I suppose that means

00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,333
She could be in
that underground mall.

349
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,041
[HAMAZURA]
This is such a mess.

350
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,041
What now?

351
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,875
Keep going or turn back?

352
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:13,958
Wait. Look.

353
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:18,625
[HAMAZURA]
Kinuhata!

354
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:20,875
Ultra-hit the deck now!

355
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,750
Darn, so close.

356
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,125
I figured that since your
ability uses nitrogen,

357
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,583
it might be smart to do
something about the air.

358
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,625
You see, there's a
momentary vacuum

359
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,875
created by the blast that
I thought would be perfect

360
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:37,875
for pumping you full of lead.

361
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,333
Go on! Both of you,
ultra-get out of here!

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,750
Get down!

363
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,333
[gunshots]

364
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,166
[SHIOKISHI] The board
authorization system has been

365
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,583
activated?

366
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,958
So she's decided to use
that here, has she?

367
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,083
What would you like me to do?

368
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,333
It appears that her
activation has neutralized

369
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,000
the political defense
functionality.

370
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,375
Also...

371
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,500
[SHIOKISHI]
GROUP? Why, that vixen!

372
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:08,291
What do you think the chances
are that she'll actually

373
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,416
resort to using
hardline measures?

374
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,583
[SHIOKISHI] It does have
something to do with DRAGON,

375
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,166
after all.

376
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,083
They're certain to be coming.

377
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:18,291
So we will engage them here.

378
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,916
This is all-out war!

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
[SUGITANI]
Yes, sir.

380
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,041
Oh, great. You see that thing
on top? It's an AIM jammer.

381
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,375
Control over our abilities is
about to be pretty restricted.

382
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:36,583
Ha.

383
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:37,916
He knew we would come
and already covered

384
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,541
his bases against us.

385
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,583
So, then, what is
our plan of action?

386
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,041
[ACCELERATOR]
Isn't it obvious?

387
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,333
We continue to break
straight through.

388
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:50,625
[ACCELERATOR]
Let's go.

389
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:53,708
Tsuchimikado, you stay
here and stand guard.

390
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,916
Ms. Oyafune, your job will
be to speak with Shiokishi.

391
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,625
One on one.

392
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,708
Accelerator and I will
stay just ahead of you

393
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:04,125
and break down the
walls as we go along.

394
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,916
But be prepared to
stand right in the line

395
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,708
of fire at the very end.

396
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,333
[ACCELERATOR]
Musujime!

397
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:14,541
It isn't working.

398
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,333
I think something else
must have happened

399
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,708
on the other side of this wall.

400
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:20,041
So you're useless.

401
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,250
[SUGITANI] Might I challenge
you two to a fight?

402
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,041
You don't listen to
instructions, do you?

403
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,375
I said I didn't want
to see you again.

404
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,958
And yet, here you are
walking straight toward me.

405
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,625
I said to make every
effort to prevent it.

406
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,583
Clearly you haven't.

407
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,375
[ACCELERATOR] Why don't you tell
us what you know about DRAGON?

408
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:41,958
[dart whizzes]

409
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,791
[SUGITANI]
Poison.

410
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,708
Musujime has the ability
to pass through walls,

411
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,208
so naturally that makes
her a much higher priority

412
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
than you.

413
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,166
[ACCELERATOR] Are you gonna
tell me who you are?

414
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,625
Who am I?

415
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,375
A descendent of the Koga.

416
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm part of a band
of dastardly spies

417
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,583
who have been doing
this sort of work

418
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:07,375
in the name of justice
since the times of old.

419
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,291
Oyafune is being handled.

420
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,541
Once she is eliminated,

421
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,500
the rest of Academy
City's collective power

422
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,083
can be mobilized, and that
will be the end of you.

423
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,500
And then, once we have
Last Order secured

424
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,250
as our final card,
it'll be over.

425
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,208
[MONAKA] What I'd like
to request of you is

426
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,083
quite simple, really.

427
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,916
Henceforth, the following
must be changed.

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,541
I want you to permanently
remove the stipulations

429
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,958
in your plans that allow
you to incorporate

430
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,583
and consume the lives
of others at will.

431
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,041
That's all.

432
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,208
This is something everyone
else has observed

433
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,875
as a matter of course.

434
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,166
I'd also like you to tell
me more of what you know

435
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,916
about DRAGON.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,375
[SHIOKISHI] What makes
you think I know more?

437
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,291
It's just something that
the fellows in GROUP

438
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,666
requested of me to ask.

439
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,000
[SHIOKISHI]
I see.

440
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,250
I am doing nothing more
than carrying out matters

441
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,208
point by point that
are necessary to keep

442
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,166
Academy City safe.

443
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,208
"DRAGON" is just a word
that carries the virtue

444
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,958
of sounding dangerous.

445
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,916
You might even call it barbaric.

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
But that's because
you don't know

447
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,833
what's behind DRAGON.

448
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,416
From what you say,
I understand it well.

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,875
Too well.
See, I too carry out actions

450
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,208
that could be called barbaric.

451
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,000
[SHIOKISHI]
Are we at an impasse?

452
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,583
We both wish to
protect Academy City,

453
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:28,500
but that seems to mean
different things to each of us.

454
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,083
[SHIOKISHI]
I see.

455
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,958
That thought never
crossed your mind, did it?

456
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,625
You didn't think
about the possibility

457
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,458
that we might have
some things in common--

458
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,625
such as taking steps
ahead of time to defend

459
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,666
our own lives.

460
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,583
Must've caught you by surprise.

461
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:47,208
[SHIOKISHI]
Wh-What?!

462
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,291
Mitsuki Unabara!

463
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,625
Is that really the name
you wanna go with?

464
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,041
I was so sure you were
gonna call me "Etzali."

465
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,375
Oh, well. My mistake.

466
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,916
That coward...

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,083
So then where's
the real Oyafune?

468
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,750
Does this mean she's
around somewhere

469
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,625
watching from a safe distance?

470
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,375
That's a very good question.

471
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,041
The talisman I use is actually
made with live human skin.

472
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,583
Knowing that, Ms. Oyafune
still didn't hesitate

473
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,625
to give a sample.

474
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,583
You call her a coward,
but peeling ten centimeters

475
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:24,291
of skin from her arm must
have been pretty painful.

476
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,083
Now, why don't you tell me
more about DRAGON?

477
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:28,583
Unless of course

478
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:31,958
you're curious about the pain
Ms. Oyafune endured?

479
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,125
Maybe you could
see for yourself

480
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,083
what that "coward" went through.

481
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,375
[SHIOKISHI grunts]

482
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:38,416
Minobe!

483
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Here's a helpful tip.

484
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,333
Always have two
security outfits on hand

485
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,416
in case someone in proximity
decides to betray you.

486
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,625
If it comes down to it,

487
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,333
they can always end
up killing each other.

488
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,625
[chuckles]

489
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,333
Huh?!

490
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:57,750
What is this?

491
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,500
Why? Why have all other security
guards besides you two

492
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:01,791
been killed?

493
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:02,916
[gasps]

494
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:11,000
[UNABARA]
It can't be!

495
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,416
[MINOBE]
And why not?

496
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Did you not consider
the possibility that others

497
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,458
may have infiltrated the
darker side of Academy City

498
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:19,291
just as you have done?

499
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:21,916
[UNABARA]
Técpatl! And Tochtli!

500
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,583
[KAMIJO] It appears in
the form of Fuse=KAZAKIRI.

501
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:02,333
The aeon passes
from Osiris to Horus.

502
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:05,666
"Do what thou wilt shall
be the whole of the Law."

503
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,291
Next time, "DRAGON."

504
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,208
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
