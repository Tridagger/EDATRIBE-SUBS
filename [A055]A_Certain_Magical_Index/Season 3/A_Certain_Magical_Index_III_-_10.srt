00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,375
a French anti-English
organization

179
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,541
has managed to board
the plane somehow.

180
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,416
And if certain demands
aren't met right away,

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,166
the plane and everyone
on it will crash and burn.

182
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,583
[KAMIJO]
Seriously?

183
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,291
Yes, these terrorists
are demanding

184
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,583
that the major airlines'
customer management systems

185
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,791
be destroyed.

186
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,500
Their goal is to
completely eliminate

187
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,291
all of the routes into England.

188
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,750
The blood spatter
you saw earlier

189
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,666
came from one of my colleagues.

190
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,291
We believe the terrorist
was responsible for that.

191
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,916
Wait a minute, you're
not trying to suggest

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,583
I'm the culprit here, are you?

193
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:31,458
No, of course not.
No one was thinking that.

194
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,125
Do you think just the
two of you can handle

195
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
finding this criminal?

196
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,708
Seems like you'd need
as much help as possible.

I'll back you up.

00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,125
I don't want this
chaos to keep spreading.

an amateur milling around

responsibility for the lives

I think Index overheard
that guy saying it.

238
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,708
This aircraft is
built with sensors

239
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,291
that can auto-detect the
shocks from a belly landing.

240
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,291
It will instantly shut
down all the engines

00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,916
to prevent an explosion.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,250
So then, if that malfunctions...

243
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,875
The aircraft would crash.

244
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,208
I get the gist of
what happened here.

245
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,666

end up worse than this.

I can't have them
making assumptions.

you sequestered for now--

[COPILOT 10A]
The fuel gauge!

276
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,541
It shouldn't be
dropping like that!

277
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,375
My only guess is there's
a hole in the tank!

278
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,708
At this rate, we're not
gonna make it to the airport!

279
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,625
Worst case scenario,
we'll need to prepare

280
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,541
for an emergency
landing on a highway!

281
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,708

Damn it! Just hold on,
I'll be right there!

283
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,416
It sounds as if
that illusion you set up

284
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,625
is finally starting
to have an effect.

285
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,666
Creating an illusion with
just the gauge reading

286
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,500
is much simpler
than it may seem.

287
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,541
So they're not
landing at an airport.

288
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,750
You're going to force them
down on a country highway

289
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,458
with few buildings nearby?

290
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,791
Yes, unless of course

291
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,500
you'd prefer to have
it explode in the city

292
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,958
or a residential area.

293
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,750
Where can they make
an emergency landing?

294
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,375
It would have to
be a major highway

295
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,541
that leads from
London to Scotland.

296
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:37,625
Let's see...

00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,750
Between Kendal and Carlisle.

298
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,500
[LAURA] Then we'll need to
block the pertinent highway

299
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,000
as soon as we can,

300
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,166
and shut down all the roads
that feed into it, as well.

I don't mind that you're
speeding things along,

to do if that airliner

it to Edinburgh Airport!

In fact, it's very possible
the engines themselves

00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,750
It appears that the airliner
has gained altitude.

328
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:56,083

aborted their landing.

353
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,583
I don't understand. Why now?

354
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,541
Why did he wait to act?

355
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,416
Wouldn't it be
because he was looking

356
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,208
to create a problem
over British airspace?

357
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,791
[KAMIJO]
If he had done it right away,

358
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:22,250
he could have given himself
more time to negotiate

359
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,500
and still shaken
Britain up a bit.

360
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:25,583
He's gone now.

361
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,875
So it doesn't matter
anymore, right?

362
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:30,583
Should we still be
worried about him?

363
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,708
There has to be a reason
he waited until the end

364
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,875
of the flight to cause
any kind of disturbance.

365
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,833
There's still another one.

366
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,500
The cargo hold!

367
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,541
He waited until we were
finished loading cargo

368
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,000
at the airport in Paris.

369
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:46,500
Then he attacked.

370
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,916
And that's because he
was waiting for his buddy,

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,916
who was tossed
on with the cargo.

372
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,958
He was waiting for insurance.

373
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,666
Is there only one way to get in?

374
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,333
Uh, yes.

375
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,541
This stowaway terrorist
is most likely armed.

376
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,791
So that means we
shouldn't charge him

377
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,666
right after opening the door.

378
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,500
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT] But there
aren't any other ways in or out.

379
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,291
Could we use that air duct?

380
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,208
[FLIGHT ATTENDANT]
No way.

381
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,583
It's not like in the movies.

382
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,083
There's not enough space
for a person to get through.

383
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,291
No, it's just right.

384
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,000
What are you going to do, Toma?

385
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,375
There were coffee
and tea bottles

386
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,125
in the free drinks
station, weren't there?

387
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,875
Do you think you could
bring me some of those?

388
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,333
But I need you to make them
as hot as possible first.

389
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,875
Negotiations must have failed.

390
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,833
Not my problem. I'm bringing
this plane down either way.

391
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:55,416
[EIKER]
Is that tea?

392
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,708
[KAMIJO]
Hey there, terrorist!

393
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,125
Ever heard of thermal expansion?

394
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,666
[KAMIJO grunts]

395
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,583
[EIKER yells]

396
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:02,833
[KAMIJO yelling]

397
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,666
I'll take this plane down!

398
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,750
Back off!

399
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,458
Thanks to the
Eurotunnel explosion,

400
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,750
our great France has
been forced to sustain

401
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,083
some massive losses!

402
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,875
And that's why we
will stop at nothing

403
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,833
to make sure they
suffer the same damage!

404
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,625
We're not just blocking
their land routes,

405
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,250
they'll lose their
air routes, too!

406
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,083
Forget about whether
it's Britain or France

407
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,416
who's at fault!

408
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,041
Allies like you shouldn't
be fighting each other!

409
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,750
Did you know those are
all full of liquid food?

410
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:34,958
France is sending it to sick
people in Britain for relief!

411
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,333
They're trying to help!

412
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,458
Isn't that the relationship
Britain and France have?

413
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:40,750
There are still idiots
wherever you go.

414
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,166
I'm not willing to let
these idiots off the hook

415
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,833
just because you
say they're mixed in

416
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,000
with some good people.

417
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:46,875
No, don't!

418
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,458
[EIKER laughs]

419
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,291
[STIYL]
For crying out loud.

420
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,958
Ever the amateur, I see.

421
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,208
[KAMIJO gasps]

422
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,666
[EIKER grunting]

423
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,583
[STIYL] It's ten minutes
to Edinburgh Airport.

424
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,833
I think he should be able
to survive for that long.

425
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,291
[EIKER gasping]

426
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,791
For heaven's sake, you're
supposed to be watching over her

427
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,583
in some fashion or another.

428
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,416
I'd appreciate it if you'd at
least show that much resolve.

429
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,708
Hang in there.

430
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,166
[RADIO HOST 10A]
Now for an update.

431
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,166
The jumbo jet Sky Bus
365 has just landed

432
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,583
at Edinburgh Airport.

433
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,958
Didn't expect that. Sounds like
the plane landed safely.

434
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,375
And at the airport.

435
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,375
Well, yeah, but only because
of the stealth transport

436
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:02,125
that was sent in using
Academy City's technology.

437
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,291
I think Britain may be
stretched to the limit.

438
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,541
Whenever I channel any
magic, my body starts

439
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,125
to get tingly all over!

440
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,083
Put on your game faces.

441
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,458
It looks like we're
about to break up

442
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,375
the very paradigm
that is Britain.

443
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,666
[KAMIJO] Multiple threads
intertwine around

444
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,500
ceremonial accouterments.

445
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,875
The true purpose of the
sorcerers known as "New Light"

446
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:03,958
is revealed.

447
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,208
Next time, "British Labyrinth."

448
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:08,916
When science and
magic cross paths,

449
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,041
a story is born.
