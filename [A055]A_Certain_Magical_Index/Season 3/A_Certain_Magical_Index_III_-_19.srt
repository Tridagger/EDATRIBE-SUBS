raze our homes to the ground

They're greedy for land.

as to scatter landmines

the pretext of preventing

All of the Sisters connected
to the Misaka Network

can have their actions shut
down with a single command

You should know that
there is a device installed

inside of Misaka's body
which will ensure

271
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,833
that a shutdown command
from Last Order is rejected.

272
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,791
Relying on her would be foolish.

to stop this Misaka.

mean all your other efforts

rendered meaningless.

just have to sit back

353
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:34,625
[ACCELERATOR laughing]

354
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,541
[MISAKA WORST]
It's... your fault.

355
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,083
[grunts] Your... fault.

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,125
[ACCELERATOR coughs, retches]

357
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,666
Well, screw a whole
load of that!

358
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,666
Screw it all! Screw it all!
Screw it all!

359
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,750
So...

360
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,208
She was created
and killed for my sake

361
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,750
as a pawn in a twisted
plan to break me.

362
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,291
That's why she was sent!

363
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,166
That's what the scum in
Academy City is after, right?

364
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,708
No matter how much
we've suffered,

365
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:21,583
this kid has to die, and my
mind has to be blown to pieces!

366
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:25,291
Meanwhile, some jerks are off
lounging in a nice, warm room!

367
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,333
Probably having a drink
and smiling about

368
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,916
how clever they are.

369
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
Congratulating themselves for
putting this whole twisted plan

370
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,625
of theirs into motion.

371
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,416
Well, I'm onto them.

372
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Which means now I'll have
to throw it all back

373
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,125
in their faces!

374
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,708
If the only way their plan will
succeed is if this kid dies,

375
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,416
then I'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

376
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,666
I'll save her life and guarantee
their project's failure!

377
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,041
Watch closely,
you filthy sons of bitches!

378
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,166
I'm done putting up
with your crap.

379
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,791
I'm gonna wipe those smug
expressions off your faces,

380
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,458
starting right now!

381
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,333
Stupid punk-ass, scum-sucking,
dirt-eating sons of bitches!

382
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,750
You rotten bastards think
you have me all figured out,

383
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,083
don't you?

384
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,291
You look down on me and
think all I know how to do

385
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,291
is cause pain and kill!

386
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:15,916
I'll show you right now that
I am much more than that.

387
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,166
I have what it takes to
protect something, too!

388
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,083
Watch!

389
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,875
Just watch!

390
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,958
[KAMIJO] Black wings cast
a hue over the snowy plain.

391
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,083
Blood-soaked fists
clench tightly.

392
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:05,250
The mightiest and the
lowliest clash once again.

393
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,250
Next time,
"A Reason to Protect."

394
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,458
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
