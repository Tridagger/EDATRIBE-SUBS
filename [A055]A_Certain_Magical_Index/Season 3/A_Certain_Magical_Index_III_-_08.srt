1
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:39,458
[TATEMIYA]
Damn it all!

2
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,208
Hey.

3
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,250
What are you doing
huddling on the floor

4
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:46,458
over there by yourself?

5
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,958
He said...

6
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,666
He said thank you
to me even though...

7
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,458
I did nothing to help him.

8
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:56,000
I couldn't protect him
at all with my magic,

9
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,500
and he thanked me.

10
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,791
I was thinking about his power,

11
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,958
and how I always thought
it was so amazing

12
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,041
even before I'd met him.

13
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,708
But I was so wrong.

14
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not like that.

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:12,000
He can't rely on
any defensive spells.

16
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,083
There's no restoration
spell that can heal

17
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:16,291
even a single scratch.

18
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,458
He truly fights with
just his physical body.

19
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,166
All I could do was watch
as he was beaten.

20
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,875
He doesn't have any magic.

21
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,500
Yet he goes on living
like it's nothing.

22
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,708
Divine punishment should
be raining down on me.

23
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,791
This isn't how it should be!

24
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,958
You've gotta be kidding me--
this is the kind of girl

25
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,125
he stuck his neck
out to protect?

26
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,333
The man you owe your
life to is laying there

27
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:40,333
black and blue and
you're saying all you can do

28
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,916
is sit here and cry about it?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,916
He threw his life away for you
and you don't lift a finger?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,708
How do you think
he'd feel if he knew

31
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,416
he risked his life for nothing?

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,833
Do you hear me?
Absolutely nothing!

33
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:52,375
[ITSUWA gasps]

34
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,166
[TATEMIYA] Acqua of the Rear
will definitely be returning.

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,083
And while you're sitting
around doing nothing,

36
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:59,291
the clock will continue
to count down.

37
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,041
Every second you waste dwelling

38
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,083
on your own useless
regret and guilt

39
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,875
is time we could've
used looking for a way

40
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,375
to protect him.

41
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,916
Don't throw away
someone else's entire life

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,125
just because you've got
some problems to work out!

43
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:14,708
You want to apologize to him?

45
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,333
You want to make
it up to the person

46
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,083
you were supposed
to be protecting?

47
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,458
Do you want to
send him back home

48
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,208
and into the light of day?

49
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,208
Then get up and fight!

50
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,125
Prove to him that you're
the best woman out there

51
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,333
and that he was right
to risk his life for you.

52
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,208
He can't be moved
by your tears or accept

53
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,583
your apologies
if he's not alive.

54
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,250
Of course, if you
would prefer to repent

55
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,625
from in front of his grave,
then stay behind.

56
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,750
If not, we must fight.

57
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:38,958
Honestly.

58
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,333
It's unacceptable to
see someone in despair

59
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,375
right in front of us
and not have the ability

60
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,291
to extend a hand to help him.

61
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,333
Therefore, there's only
one thing left for us to do.

62
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,833
[ROMAN POPE] So you've
decided not to kill him

63
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,416
and have settled on
taking his right arm?

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,541
I was told the Right Seat
of God never deviated

65
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,166
from their policies.

66
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,791
You'll find no deviation here.

67
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,291
The boy's uniqueness
is focused in his right arm.

68
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,625
If we can take it from him,
then the threat he poses

69
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,000
will be removed.

70
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,625
[ROMAN POPE] I've heard
that the boy in question

71
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,916
does not yet know God.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,833
And If I'm being honest,
I must admit

73
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,000
that I am opposed
to killing him.

74
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,625
Though Vento laughed
at me when I told her that.

75
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,083
I don't exactly
know what it is

76
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,375
you're expecting of me,

77
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,333
but I am nowhere
near as virtuous

78
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,625
or as philanthropic as you are.

79
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,083
If the time comes to
kill him, then I will.

80
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,833
And that's all there is to it.

81
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,833
They're dispersing fine
particulates into the air.

82
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,208
It looks like they're being
used to break down matter.

83
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,750
[alarm blaring]

84
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,833
[SAFETY OFFICIAL]
Attention: A low-oxygen alert

85
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,458
has been issued
for the entire third level.

86
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,791
Everyone, please take
shelter in your designated

87
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,875
building and do not
leave until instructed.

88
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:23,958
I repeat.

89
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,791
A low-oxygen alert
has been issued

90
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,416
for the entire third level.

91
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,708
[ROMAN POPE]
Have things taken a wrong turn?

92
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,333
[ACQUA] Feels more like
a trial run to probe

93
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,166
my combat abilities.

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,875
However, I don't sense
any human presence.

95
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:40,416
These are likely
unmanned drones.

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,583
I doubt they would've
been able to get so close

97
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,250
were that not the case.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,250
I am the Right Seat of God.

99
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,375
I am a saint in whom
dwells the Power of God.

100
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,875
If any of you dare
to stand in my way,

101
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,125
then brace yourselves
accordingly.

102
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,208
[phone rings]

103
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,541
[ORSOLA] Hello?
Are you there, Miss Sherry?

104
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,666
I do hope I've called
the correct number.

105
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,583
[SHERRY]
Huh? Yeah, hello, Orsola.

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,833
Friendly reminder,
bulk waste is picked up

107
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:19,125
on Mondays and Fridays now.

108
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:21,125
[SHERRY]
Thanks. Get to the point.

109
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,375
Yes.

110
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,458
I've been investigating
the Right Seat of God

111
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,458
and Acqua of the Rear.

112
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,833
[SHERRY] Yeah, I heard
about that this morning.

113
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,375
What did you find?

114
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,708
It seems that before he was
known as Acqua of the Rear,

115
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,000
he was actually poised
to become an English knight,

116
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,250
if you can believe that.

117
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,291
[SHERRY]
Huh?

118
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,000
Sounds like Acqua of the
Rear has been confronted

119
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,083
by a squad of
unmanned powered suits

120
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,083
on the third level.

121
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,833
If he could be stopped
by mass-produced units,

122
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,916
we would have it all too easy.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,250
Are we heading out?

124
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,666
Not yet.

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,708
We'd just be charging in
there blindly if we left now,

126
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,916
and I think we all know
how that would turn out.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,666
We need to wait
for the perfect time.

128
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,083
Meanwhile, we will prepare
ourselves and our weapons

129
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,291
as best we can,
and we must craft

130
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,708
an optimal strategy.

131
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,208
[ITSUWA] Please just wait
another three hours.

132
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,666
It takes a little more time
to re-sharpen a blade

133
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,166
and make it strong
enough to fight against

134
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,708
a monster like that.

135
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:19,000
[TATEMIYA gasps]

136
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,291
What do we do now?

137
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,125
Why'd you have to
fire her up like that?

138
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,625
I had to.

139
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:26,041
Should I have just let her
sit there like an empty shell?

140
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,750
[ITSUWA]
Tatemiya, sir.

141
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,750
I'm gonna be just fine.

142
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:33,166
Can I ask you to please
let me focus for a bit?

143
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,541
Uh, of course.

144
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,625
[phone buzzing]

145
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,875
[ORSOLA] Oh, my, would
I happen to be speaking

146
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,583
to Mr. Tatemiya?

147
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:43,833
Oh, wow!

148
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,125
It's so comforting just
listening to your voice!

149
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,583
I am terribly sorry, sir,

150
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,041
it appears I've dialed
the wrong number.

151
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,083
--Goodbye.
--[TATEMIYA] No!

152
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,375
Don't hang up!

153
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,625
[ORSOLA] I have new
information regarding

154
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,333
Acqua of the Rear's past.

155
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:03,166
His real name is William Orwell.

156
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,708
He has no mercenary affiliation
in the region of England.

157
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,625
His principle combat
record involves

158
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
astrological brigade support,

159
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,291
the mission to terminate
the Orleans Order,

160
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,416
and the Third Princess
of Britain rescue mission.

161
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,250
Heh. All of those
are battlefields comparable

162
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,208
to the worst of nightmares.

163
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,958
[ORSOLA]
Because of his achievements,

164
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:26,666
he was on track to receive
a British knighthood.

165
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,666
But then one week
before his investment,

166
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,666
he mysteriously disappeared.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,833
And naturally once
he'd resurfaced again,

168
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,375
he had become a known
enemy of England.

169
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:37,333
[ORSOLA] Not only was
he a strong fighter,

170
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,458
he also supplied knowledge
of medicinal herbs

171
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,500
to impoverished regions.

172
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,458
He showed them how
to use roots for food,

173
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,541
and many now
regard him as a sage.

174
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,750
[TATEMIYA] In other words, he's
not just a mindless savage--

175
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:51,333
he's a brilliant beast,
tough in body

176
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,791
and soft in thought.

00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,750
[ACQUA]
They've fallen back then?

178
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,083
They seem surprisingly
intelligent.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,291
Let's see...

180
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,791
There are still nineteen
hours until the deadline.

181
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,000
Have you come to
a decision yet?

182
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,041
Well, when you make a demand
as impossible as this one,

183
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,291
it tends to eliminate the need
to put too much thought into it.

184
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,125
You currently stand to
have two billion members

185
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,708
of the Roman Orthodox
Church as your enemies.

186
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,708
You have the chance
to avoid that for the price

187
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,166
of one arm.

188
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,708
I would think someone
with your intelligence

189
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,500
would call that a bargain.

190
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,250
The Roman Orthodoxy
is not our enemy.

191
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,125
It's people like you who
regularly go out of their way

192
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,541
to exploit and prey upon
those who earnestly

193
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,125
believe in God.

194
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,541
[ACQUA] Does this mean that our
negotiations have broken down?

195
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,583
[TATEMIYA] Is there anything
else it could possibly mean?

196
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,916
Don't forget that I am a saint.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,250
I also possess a vast
amount of power as part of

198
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,000
the Right Seat of God.

199
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,000
If you truly understand
what that means,

200
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,833
and you still insist
on fighting me,

201
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,958
I will use this opportunity
for a demonstration.

202
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,166
I will prove to you that
battles are not won or lost

203
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,541
by good or evil, but by
strengths and weaknesses.

204
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,583
The least you can do
is try to force me to use

Um... Uh, Itsuwa?

207
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,125
I didn't even make it
through my sentence.

208
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,333
Couldn't you wait until
I'm finished speaking?

209
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:25,583
Whatever you have to say
to us can wait until later.

210
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,750
And that's only if your
jaw is in any condition

211
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,375
to still help you speak.

212
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,083
It may not be after
I've shattered it

213
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,041
and beaten you to a
thoroughly bloody pulp!

214
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,500
I don't believe this.

215
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,625
Sounds like Itsuwa's
completely snapped.

216
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,458
This is because of what
you said, Deputy Pope.

217
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:41,666
Oh, please.

218
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,166
A girl in love will
go to war with anyone

219
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,250
who threatens her,
including God.

220
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,958
[ACQUA]
I see.

221
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,916
How extraordinarily
gallant of you,

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,500
but I would prefer
to see you back up

223
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,500
such strong words
with bona fide actions.

224
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,000
[ITSUWA]
Is that so?

225
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,750
Well rest assured, there's no
need to worry about that.

226
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,458
You can reduce us to shreds.

227
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,875
But we'll still beat
the crap out of you!

228
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,458
And we won't stop until you
regret what you've done!

229
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,416
We're taking it that far?

230
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,958
You appear to have prepared
yourself substantially for this.

231
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,291
[ITSUWA]
Of course I have.

232
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,666
This spear has been treated
with fifteen hundred

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,000
layers of resin.

234
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,791
It symbolizes the rings
of age within a tree,

235
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,791
and the form of its hidden
spell is the fertility

236
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,375
of plant life.

237
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,875
You've done well
to ready your weapon

238
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,666
in such a short amount of time.

239
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,666
I'm impressed.

surprising is that even though

you're slow, you're still able
to keep up with my speed.

243
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,375
[ACQUA]
Interesting.

244
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,208
I see you're augmenting
each other's motor skills.

245
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,250
It's almost as if you
have experience fighting

against a saint
as powerful as me.

247
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,083
But you're still too slow!

248
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,541
[FEMALE VOICE 8A]
You killed me.

00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,791

You're a killer.

250
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,666

You killed me, too, didn't you?

You killed all of us.

[ACQUA]
I see. So that's what this is.

253
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,875
In case you haven't guessed,

254
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:35,208
the form of this spell
is a murderer's punishment.

255
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,458
Each wire is a redefinition
of an individual's lifeline,

256
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,958
and the spell penalizes
whoever breaks them.

257
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,416
It's very strong,
and no defensive spell

258
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,250
from any cultural
region can stop it.

259
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,333
It denotes negative resentment.

261
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,291
[ACQUA]
My attribute is Gabriel.

262
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,083
And to a certain extent,
I can perform the esoteric rites

263
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,583
of the Holy Mother Veneration.

264
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,250
As for acts of restriction
such as severe provisions

265
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,000
dealing with sin and evil,

266
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,791
they're meaningless against me.

267
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,416
What?

268
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,833
Would it have been
so difficult to wait

269
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,625
until I finished
what I was saying?

270
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,833
All right.

271
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,208
I suppose this just adds
to the thrill of the chase.

272
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:46,875
Wow, he's here already?

273
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:50,833
[ACQUA] The bodies of the Right
Seat of God are almost angelic.

274
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,041
So they cannot perform
magic used by normal humans.

275
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,375
However...

276
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,791
The Holy Mother veneration
spells that I possess

277
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,416
can effectively remove those
bindings and conditions.

278
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,333
I am both saint and
Right Seat of God.

279
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,666
I can command both
human and angelic spells.

rest of the Right Seat of God.

[ITSUWA]
Saint Breakout!

312
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,416
Because saints possess
physical characteristics

313
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,000
that are very similar
to the Son of God.

314
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,083
They're able to generate
the same kind of powers

315
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,083
as the Son of God.

316
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,041
Using Saint Breakout
disrupts the balance

317
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,500
of those characteristics,

318
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,708
and when saints
lose that balance,

319
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,750
they don't lose their powers,

320
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,000
but they do lose
control of them,

321
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,916
and they can no longer move.

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,041
The Amakusa Church
once lost a saint

Beyond our grueling efforts

we must also help her

00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,083
Very well, then.

351
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,125
Looks like you get
to continue living.

352
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,583
[ORSOLA] It appears that William
Orwell has used an explosive

353
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:37,083
amount of power as a saint
since his days as a mercenary.

354
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:41,041
Currently, he wields power
in the Roman Orthodoxy's

355
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,541
organization,
the Right Seat of God.

356
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,208
He also had another name.

357
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,958
A sorcerer's moniker
he crafted for himself.

358
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,666
Flere Two-One-Zero.

359
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,375
Flere is a Latin word,
the infinitive "to weep."

360
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,291
His style of fighting
appears to be self-taught,

361
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,500
but his method of moving
around during combat

362
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,916
involves a spell that
uses water as a teleport.

363
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,958
Obviously, there's
a common thread here.

364
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,291
If the name "Acqua of the Rear"

365
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,208
is associated with
the four archangels,

366
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,666
it would fall under Gabriel,

367
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,875
and its attribute would
be water, so it fits.

368
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,500
Heh. I see, so that means
he's at a height normal humans

369
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,791
can't reach no matter
how hard they try.

370
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,208
[ACQUA] I've heard that the
Amakusa Church once had a saint

371
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,166
among them whose
philosophy was to kill

372
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,958
using only a single
strike of the sword.

373
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,375
However, I also heard
that this particular saint's

374
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,875
disposition was that she
absolutely hated fighting.

375
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:35,458
Do you have the nerve
it takes to fight me?

376
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,083
[KANZAKI]
Well, that's interesting.

377
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,875
Apparently, I'm a
more childish person

378
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,666
than I ever
thought myself to be.

379
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,208
I was taught anger
was one of the seven sins,

380
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,416
but I refuse to lose
any sleep over it.

381
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,000
I won't let his
resolve be for nothing.

382
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,958
That alone is enough
motivation for me.

383
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,208
You don't need to
worry about my nerves.

384
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go.

385
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,416
Single Flash!

386
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,375
[ACQUA] Talent alone can be
profoundly cruel, can't it?

387
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,583
Even though we both
use the same method,

388
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,875
our results are
vastly different.

389
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:33,958
[KANZAKI]
Not true.

390
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:38,666
My foundation is
entirely Amakusan,

391
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,375
and my teachers are
all of my friends.

392
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:45,208
Therefore, I cannot permit you
to denigrate them in any way.

393
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,791
Moreover, if someone
is conscious

394
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,583
of how much power they have

395
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,333
and yet still ruthlessly
brings it to bear

396
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,208
against an ordinary
high-school student,

397
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,791
then it doesn't matter
if they're a saint.

398
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:59,166
Such a person has lost any
right to look down on others.

399
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,708
I'm not impressed.

400
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,083
Even a foot soldier will
unwittingly encounter a tank.

401
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,041
It's the way of the battlefield.

402
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,250
And if he's not prepared,
he'll be crushed to pieces.

403
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
That's just your
way of thinking.

404
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,708
That's right, and you
and your comrades

405
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,208
are the ones who
stepped onto my territory.

406
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,083
Or, was the boy
perhaps unknowingly

407
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,041
dragged into this
by someone else?

408
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,333
If you knew he was
just an ordinary person,

409
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,125
then why did you
use your saintly power

410
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,375
against him?

411
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,416
And why would I tell you
my reasons for fighting?

412
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,416
[ACQUA] Show me yours first,
Saint of the Far East!

413
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,958
I want to know that those
are more than just words.

414
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,458
I want to see your
reason within your sword.

415
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:43,416
See if you can show me
what it is without words!

416
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,708
[KAMIJO]
Where am I?

417
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,458
Oh, man.

418
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,791
What happened to me?

419
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,708
[KAMIJO]
That's right.

420
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:42,458
The fight against Acqua
is probably still going on.

421
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:44,416
I'm sorry, Index.

422
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
I'll apologize to you later.

423
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,666
But right now,

424
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,875
just let me do what
needs to be done.

425
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:59,125
[KAMIJO]
A shot exerted by the chosen one

426
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,041
blows dignity to bits.

427
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,333
After all the despair,
will the Priestess's cries

428
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,916
get through?

429
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,250
Next time,
"Holy Mother Veneration."

430
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,250
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
