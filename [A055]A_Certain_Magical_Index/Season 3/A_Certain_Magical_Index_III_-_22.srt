00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,041
[LAURA]
What's the matter, Stiyl?

2
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm giving you a chance to
do something about this.

3
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,583
If you're not interested,
let me know, because I will.

4
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,875
I don't need you to tell me.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,041
I know what to do.

6
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:50,916
I've been doing this job
for a long time now.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,166
[INDEX]
Hostile identified.

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,875
Now conducting analysis
of available spells.

9
00:00:56,958 --> 00:01:00,083
Searching construction
of suitable local weapons.

10
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,916
[KAMIJO] He went out of
his way to get this ready.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,708
In order for Fiamma
to accomplish what he has

12
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,375
set out to do,

13
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,750
he must need this
Star of Bethlehem here.

14
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,000
Which means that
if I destroy it,

15
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,833
I'll be able to do damage
to Fiamma, as well.

16
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,208
[FIAMMA] Let's see, I've got the
angel medium Sasha Kruezhev,

17
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,458
the magical item to remotely
control the 103,000 grimoires,

18
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:39,166
the Star of Bethlehem,
the ceremonial site,

19
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,666
and your right hand
fit to wield my power.

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,625
It would appear that I've
acquired everything I need.

21
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,833
I say it's high time to ask
the supporting players

22
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,166
to leave the stage.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,166
Charge forth, Archangel Gabriel.

24
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,166
Obliterate everything.

25
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:01,875
No way.

26
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,833
So the reason he abducted
Sasha was to enlist the power

27
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,000
of an archangel.

28
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,583
I guess I'll just have
to smash that angel up

29
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,291
until she's immobilized!

30
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,291
[grunts]

31
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,250
[KAMIJO]
Sasha Kruezhev?

32
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,250
[FIAMMA] The Star of
Bethlehem is not yet complete,

33
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,166
but the moment I set
Sasha Kruezhev in motion

34
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,500
was the moment my
victory became undeniable.

35
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:27,083
All I need now
is that parchment.

36
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,416
Simple fix.

37
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,666
Why don't you
retrieve it for me?

38
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,416
There's no reason
to show mercy to them

39
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,125
just because they're weak.

40
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,125
Go claim it with everything
you have, and don't hold back!

41
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,791
[ELIZALINA]
That completes her treatment.

42
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,875
All of the toxins that
I found inside of her

43
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,791
have been successfully removed.

44
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,333
Scientific efficiency
is quite distasteful.

45
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,958
I have little faith
that it will change.

46
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,666
Have you guys seen
that big mess outside?

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,125
What the hell's goin'
on out there, damn it?

48
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,666
It's Fiamma's work.

49
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't think he'd touch
the four elements.

[TAKITSUBO grunts]

51
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,708
Be careful!

52
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,500
You're so light.

53
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,666
Hamazura, you suck.

54
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,958
Is something wrong?

55
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,916
[HAMAZURA] I'll fill you in on
everything later, but for now,

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,208
let me just say this.

57
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,166
You're gonna be all right.

58
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,583
So, what do we do now?

59
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:46,875
Our main objective:
negotiate with Academy City.

60
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,500
We're going back into Russia.

61
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,875
We'll find what we need there.

62
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,166
But you...

63
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,333
You're still recovering
from being sick.

64
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:56,083
You can stay here if you want.

65
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,125
Really?

66
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,750
Tell me how to wake you up.

67
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,500
With a kiss or a
smack on the head?

68
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,083
If those are my options,

69
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,208
I should try leaving
you behind more often.

70
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,083
[HAMAZURA]
What's that?

71
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,916
This is bad.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,833
The Russian army might
be planning to use

73
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,708
a bacteriological weapon
near that village.

74
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,125
You think they'd do that?

75
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,500
A secret silo.

76
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,375
It was abandoned
during the Cold War.

77
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,750
But it's close to that location.

78
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,291
There's a manual to keep
it safe from enemies

79
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,041
called the Kremlin Report.

80
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,125
What should we do?

81
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,791
Find it?

82
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,250
[TAKITSUBO] The Elizalina
Alliance of Independent Nations

83
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,541
will be suspected of
assisting the villagers,

84
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,541
and of trying to acquire
information on how

85
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,541
the nuclear facility works.

86
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,333
So the orders are to stay away.

87
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:44,750
They can't be serious.

88
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,791
Listen. I can't--

89
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,041
I can't leave Digurv and
the others in the lurch.

90
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,208
I don't want to abandon them.

91
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,375
I get it. I'm coming, too.

I owe them my life.

95
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,666
I'm ready.

96
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,333
I want to fight for them myself.

00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,750
[HAMAZURA] You're not going
to change your mind, huh?

98
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,041
I'm not. Are you?

99
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,250
[ELIZALINA]
How can this be?

100
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,583
Is that an angel?

101
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,541
We're looking right at
the core of the mystery

102
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,666
that me and the kid were forced
into being involved with.

103
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,416
If we can find a way
to control that thing,

104
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,041
it would be the breakthrough
that I need to save her.

105
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,458
You have to go.
They're coming soon.

106
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:29,708
Huh? Who's coming?

107
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,750
And why are they
coming after me?

108
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,708
The castle isn't
quite completed yet.

109
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,208
The parchment in your
possession is proof of that.

110
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,666
Think about it.

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,833
Fiamma went so far as using
the army to get his hands

112
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,083
on that document, so it
must be critical to his plans.

113
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,500
[ACCELERATOR]
Yeah, I get it.

114
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:49,291
If I have it, that proves
he hasn't been able

115
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,458
to gather all of the essential
pieces together yet.

116
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,958
If I had to guess,

117
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,500
I'd say he's missing some
important information,

118
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:58,583
and that will bridge the gap.

119
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,708
He probably wants to pair it
with Index's magical grimoires

120
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,000
to achieve his maximum effect.

121
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,791
Index, huh?

122
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,750
That's yet another connection
to some mysterious set of laws

123
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,291
neither I nor the dark
organizations of the world

124
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,625
know the full scope of.

125
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,458
That damn Level Zero bastard.

126
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:20,125
Just how many steps
ahead of me is he?

127
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,083
That's why I feel
you're in danger.

128
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,791
Even if you were to turn over
the parchment right now,

129
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,708
you could still be captured
and pressed for information.

130
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,708
[ACCELERATOR]
I wouldn't give them up.

131
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,416
What if they end up being
the essential key I need?

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,958
I might finally have
a way to free Last Order.

133
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,208
Okay, got it.

134
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,708
Misaka will retrieve
Last Order right away.

135
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,875
But Misaka could
really use a weapon.

136
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,208
What for?

137
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,750
Misaka appreciates your
generosity in helping her.

138
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,833
In return, she would strongly
advise that you give

139
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,333
the Russian Army a wide
berth for the time being.

141
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,041
What exactly does
she mean by that?

142
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,541
Are you going to do
something foolhardy?

143
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,000
No extra charge.

147
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:09,166
How is it that you have
come to know my name?

148
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,708
Hmm...

149
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:14,000
To be honest, I'm not really
sure where to begin with that.

150
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,458
[KAMIJO grunts]

151
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,291
My first answer:

152
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,208
I have determined
that I did not receive

153
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,166
a favorable response from you.

154
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,041
By way of further explanation,

155
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,208
I suspect that you are
here to capture me,

156
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,416
seeing as how I fled
from the ceremonial site.

157
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,166
No, I promise, I'm not!

158
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,875
Do you know who that angel is?

159
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,583
I thought she was you,
but that's obviously wrong!

160
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,833
You think it's possible
that Fiamma has used you

161
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,750
to summon another angel?

162
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:41,958
Please tell me.

163
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,833
I'm trying to stop him.

164
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,666
My second answer:

165
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,250
By the time I had awakened,
the ceremony was already over.

166
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,916
The ceremonial site was
built with an odd focus

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,666
on the element of fire.

168
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,916
[KAMIJO]
The difference is

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,125
this angel isn't living
inside Sasha's body

170
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,916
like what happened
at Angel Fall.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,250
It's completely exposed.

172
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:07,291
However, if he used
Sasha to summon Misha,

173
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,333
the two of them
could be connected.

174
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,125
And that means...

175
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,208
[SASHA]
By way of further explanation,

176
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,833
the angel represented
by fire is Michael,

177
00:10:18,916 --> 00:10:22,041
but the angel waiting on
the battlefield now is Gabriel.

178
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,458
Which is to say,
the water element--

179
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,583
[gasps]

180
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,250
I could be wrong.
Not seeing anything.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,333
Damn it.

182
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,833
And there's no change in Misha.

183
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,458
Guess it's not gonna work.

184
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,125
[KAMIJO grunts]

185
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,208
Question two, if I may:

186
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,750
Do you possess the
same soul as Vasilissa?

187
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,916
What the hell are
you even talking about?

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
My third answer is this:

189
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,375
I do not believe ceremony
alone could control

190
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:54,416
a powerful angel.

191
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,833
However, to explain further,

192
00:10:56,916 --> 00:11:00,000
there was one magical
item I'd never seen before.

193
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,375
Which item?

194
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,541
Specifically, a staff.

195
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,125
One with a cylindrical
magical item at the top,

196
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,250
small enough to
hold in your hand.

197
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,125
[KAMIJO] I wonder if that's
what he was using earlier

198
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,458
to remotely control Index.

199
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,958
If it is, he could be using
it to control Misha Kruezhev

200
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,125
as well.

201
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,666
[ACQUA]
Gabriel.

202
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,791
Archangel who signaled the
Annunciation of the Son of God.

203
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,125
He was also known for
exacting divine punishment

204
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,208
upon the city of wickedness.

205
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,666
It makes sense.

206
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,416
This is why Fiamma's
head became so swollen.

207
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,166
I wonder if he's forgotten.

208
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,083
Perhaps it would be
beneficial to remind him

209
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,000
all that I preside over
in the Right Seat of God.

210
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,000
Have you ever seen a more
divine power than this?

211
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,208
[PIETRO]
How glorious!

212
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,166
The victory of the
Roman Orthodox Church

213
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,500
has been assured.

214
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Once the papal conclave
has been assembled,

215
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,833
I will become the next pope!

216
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,875
Cardinal Pietro Yogdis!

217
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,166
The public has begun
to advance on us!

218
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,458
We will temporarily postpone
the papal conclave.

219
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,500
Absolutely not!
The conclave will proceed!

220
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,750
But Your Eminence!

221
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,833
Mobilize some of the
Roman Orthodox units

222
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,166
to put them down!

223

[WARRIOR MONK 22A]
Impossible!

224
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,000
I can't do that, sir!

225
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,666
We cannot turn our arms
against our own people!

226
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,833
The Roman pope is among them!

227
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,625
Our own pope is doing
all he can to calm them.

228
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,458
He's managed to quiet
the rioting somewhat.

229
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,625
They are now on their
way into the Vatican.

230
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,500
There are so many of them.

231
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,958
We have no way of
stopping their march.

232
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,625
[WARRIOR MONK 22D]
We can't.

233
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,041
Not this man.

234
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,458
Our pope has chosen his course.

235
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,708
Who are we, then,
to stand in his way?

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,250

No... No...

237
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,416
No!

I am going to be the next pope!

239
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:20,833
He must die!

240
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,583

[PIETRO gasps]

243
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,291
I no longer identify as
the Roman pope you rival.

244
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,208
I am here as Matthai Reese,

245
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,750
just an ordinary believer
with a desire to put an end

246
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,583
to this war and protect
the citizens I love.

247
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,125
You what?

248
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,958
[ROMAN POPE] That which we need
to save our world from ruin

249
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,625
may lie beneath the
Basilica of San Pietro.

250
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:44,500
There is a vast library there
that the English Index

251
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,416

was once directed to,

252
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,625
and you're going to
give me access to it.

253
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,791
That library may be
the best hope we have

00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,875
of countering Fiamma's attack.

It's disheartening to learn that

regarding your actions?

Although...

I suppose I don't have

if I'm here beside you.

280

We're facing a grave situation.

281
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,583
The enemy is armed
with an item that boasts

282
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,333
a level of refinement
comparable to Curtana.

283
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,916
I'd even dare to
suggest it surpasses it.

[KNIGHT LEADER] I believe she
views treating the injured

as her first priority.

291
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:47,000
She sees combat as
nothing more than a chance

to offer her services
to those in need.

293
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:51,625
[FEMME FATALE] That shouldn't
come as a surprise.

[CARISSA] Let's see what
this monster is made of.

301
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,791
How humiliating for you
to learn that I have

302
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,833
the same level of

You have the archangel
of water at your disposal

What are you trying to say?

315
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,916
[FIAMMA] Just that it makes
sense now why you got no further

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,458
than bishop.

317
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm surprised that you
would honestly think

318
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,291
someone like me would
use his own resources

319
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:00,208
for the sake of a lowly
mass of Russians.

320
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,416
Why, you--

321
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,000
Look, Fiamma, you must
know that you are

00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
fundamentally mistaken
about something.

00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,458
The Right Seat of God
does not have the ability

to use spells in the same
way that typical sorcerers do.

325
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,208
Isn't that the whole reason
you had to use 200 sorcerers

in the creation of
that floating fortress?

327
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,708
But did you ever comprehend
that those same sorcerers

00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,958
are my pawns?

With just one word
from me, your fortress

330

would disintegrate.

And how would you handle
that, Fiamma?

[FIAMMA laughs]

333
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,208
If that's the best retort
you could do after giving it

334
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,416
serious thought, then it's
a wonder you even made bishop.

335
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,583
There's a good reason I went
to the trouble of acquiring

the remote-control magical item
for the 103,000 grimoires.

Hold on! You can use them?

You're able to use powers
other than those

of the Right Seat of God?

340
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,833
[FIAMMA] For me to become
the Person Superior to God,

341
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:54,750
I must have separate powers.

342
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,583
And so, while it pains me to
end our fruitful partnership,

343
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,500
your usefulness to me
is at an end.

344
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:03,666
Thus, I will now be disposing
of your 200 sorcerers.

time dwelling on this.

in your defeat.

Do you have any
idea what that was?

I couldn't even make it out.

355
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,291
Gabriel is known
as a message bearer.

00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,916
She's diverting our
instincts and foresight.

Rely only on your
five primary senses.

358

Using your sixth sense will
throw your timing off.

[MISHA] You are not effective.
Not effective.

You are nothing.

you barbarian?

Isn't your Curtana

of the same amount
of archangel power

I understand it now.

I know how this looks.

00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,250
It does stand to reason that if
my Curtana Second fragment

would be diminished.

pressing the attack,

into unrecognizable pieces.
