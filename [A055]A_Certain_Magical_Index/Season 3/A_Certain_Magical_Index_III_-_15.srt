00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,541
[DEPARTMENT]
What sort of merchandise

2
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,791
are you in the market for?
A getaway car? A safe house?

3
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,958
Or perhaps some
monetary exchange?

4
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:40,541
Don't worry, I'm not going
to ask why you want it.

5
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,666
Just tell me exactly
what you need.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,125
[ACCELERATOR] Mr.
spells-his-name-"General-Goods"

7
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:48,125
but-calls-himself-Department,
is that for sale, too?

8
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,541
[DEPARTMENT]
Hmm, is that your only interest?

9
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,916
Because unfortunately,
she's not an option.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,791
She's more of a punching bag.

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,625
What's this?

12
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,083
[ACCELERATOR]
It's cash up front.

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:03,125
I got stuck with a crappy job,
and now I'm pissed off.

14
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,458
[DEPARTMENT sighs]
I'm telling you right now,

15
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:07,500
killing her would cost
you seven million.

16
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,166
I don't understand why
you're so interested

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,541
in the girl, anyway.

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,041
Oh, goodness, there seems
to be some confusion.

19
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,250
I apologize for not
making myself very clear,

20
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,708
but you see, she's not
the one I just purchased.

21
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,958
It's you, Mr. Department.

22
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,000
[ACCELERATOR]
All right, the job is complete.

23
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,916
I hope you know it's crap
like this that bores me

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,333
to tears.

25
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,416
Need? I'm gonna need a team.

26
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,291
To collect this pile
of flesh so I don't puke

27
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,250
every time I inhale.

28
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,833
Can you also look around
and see if there are any

29
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,125
spare clothes that
would fit a female?

30
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,875
What size? How should I know?

31
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,541
Why don't you just make
sure the recovery team

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,125
is made up of women.

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm being very serious.

34
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,000
If there's even one
man among them,

35
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,416
I'll kick his nuts in.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,875
All right, that's it.

37
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,833
You're free to go live your
life however you want to.

38
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:26,291
Always remember it's up to you
whether you succeed or fail.

39
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,500
Wait, who are you?

40
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,458
[ACCELERATOR] I'm a villain.
Just a punk-ass villain.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,125
[LAST ORDER] "So anyway,
today's supper is going to be

42
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,458
hamburger stew,"
says Misaka Misaka

43
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:41,916
as she delivers the results
of her scouting report.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,875
[ACCELERATOR] I guess
Yomikawa finally figured out

45
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,791
how to use the rice cooker
to make something

46
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,125
besides rice.

47
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,208
[LAST ORDER] "You said we would
see each other this weekend,

48
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,833
right?" asks Misaka Misaka,
requesting a confirmation.

49
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,125
[ACCELERATOR]
Yeah, unless my plans change.

50
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,500
[LAST ORDER] "Oh! Yomikawa is
bringing the hamburger stew!"

51
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,583
exclaims Misaka Misaka
giving a priority-one report!

52
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,083
Is that so?

53
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,291
Your life is just one pit-stop
after the other, isn't it?

54
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:12,041
[phone ringing]

55
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,583
[LAST ORDER]
"Is something the matter?"

56
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,833
asks Misaka Misaka,
cocking her head at the sound

57
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,041
of the phone.

58
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,541
[ACCELERATOR]
Nothing to worry about.

59
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,666
Just room service
checking back in.

I don't like you

says Misaka Misaka,
pleading with you.

63
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,208
[ACCELERATOR]
Don't be ridiculous.

64
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,833
No need to be
concerned about a guy

65
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,625
you couldn't even
kill with a nuke.

66
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,291
Those maids are proof
that times have taken

67
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,291
a turn for the better,
am I right?

68
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,625
[grunts]

69
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,041
It's insulting for you
to call someone like that

70
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,208
a professional maid.

71
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Yeah? How so?

72
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,416
They're misrepresenting
real maids.

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,166
It's not fair that
I get leering looks

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,916
just because I wear this outfit.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,333
You want to know
what's not fair?

76
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,750
The fact that unsexy
maids even exist at all!

77
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,666
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

78
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,791
It sounds like I'm going
to have to be a good sister

79
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,958
and show you what a
professional maid really is,

80
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,041
you creeper.

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,000
I need to grab some lead
for my mechanical pencil.

You really are the best!

How sweet of you to
help me with my homework!

Together we'll knock
it out by morning!

On second thought,
I've got a lot to do,

87
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,875
so maybe I shouldn't
come over tonight.

88
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:22,958
Adieu!

00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:24,750
Have you no heart? Come on!

00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:33,875
All right, I'm here.

91
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,541
So what's our
homework for today?

92
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,041
[MUSUJIME] Someday, I'm
getting out of here for good.

93
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,708
And I'll beat everyone
at this game that has

94
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,875
no way to be won.

95
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,083
[phone buzzes]

96
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,916
[KOMOE]
Hello? Hello, Musujime?

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,625
Don't forget today is the
day you're going to learn

98
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,458
how to make stir-fry vegetables!

99
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,333
I'll be here waiting for you
with an empty tummy

100
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,625
and visions of
stir-fried deliciousness!

101
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,916
I can hardly wait!

102
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,791
I hate to do this to you.

103
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,625
But something urgent came up and
we're gonna need to reschedule.

104
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,000
No, please! Not today, too!
That breaks my heart!

105
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,916
What am I supposed to do
with all these vegetables

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,916
--I just bought?
--Enjoy them, I guess?

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,041
I heard vegetarians
live longer anyway.

108
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:22,041
I seem to remember
this RV having a kitchen?

109
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,833
Or am I just imagining things?

110
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,250
[XOCHITL] I see you're
still using that face.

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,083
You must really love it,
don't you, Etzali?

112
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,791
[UNABARA] And you're still
as cranky as ever,

113
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,083
aren't you, Xochitl?

114
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,083
Where's the original grimoire?

115
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,291
I hope you thought to
put it somewhere safe.

116
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:39,500
[UNABARA]
It's right here.

117
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,416
So can you tell me
what happened?

118
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,041
Basically, I screwed up.

119
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,583
Then in order to make it right,
I had my own body meddled with.

120
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,875
No one tried to stop
you from doing it?

121
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:51,916
Tochtli?

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,666
You two were friends,
weren't you?

123
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,541
I don't know how to answer that.

124
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,541
I'm pretty sure whatever friends
you happen to be thinking of

125
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,250
are people with faces
I don't recognize

126
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,958
and names I don't know.

127
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,750
Don't try to tell me I'm wrong.

128
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,625
Whatever your reasons,
you switched camps

129
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:11,083
from Azteca to Academy City
and then took me down.

130
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:13,708
Or did you forget...
Big brother?

131
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,083
Damn it, Unabara!

132
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,416
You've got some serious
explaining to do, young man!

133
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,083
Quick, get back! He's probably
from the organization!

134
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,166
[UNABARA]
No.

135
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,250
Unfortunately,
this perv is on my side.

136
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,250
Are you really telling me
that you can lose your mind

137
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,500
over a Level Five
middle-school girl here

138
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,250
when you've got a little
sister waiting for you

139
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:32,083
back home, you freak?

140
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:34,000
What's this about
a middle school girl?

141
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,291
[UNABARA] I have no idea.
What's going on with you?

142
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
Be honest with me, Etzali.

143
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,291
Is that the real reason you
betrayed the organization?

144
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,750
Would you calm down, please?
Look, it's not what you think.

145
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,458
It's more of a
mentoring relationship

146
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,666
than actual siblings.

147
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
You mean you're not related?

148
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:49,083
Well, that's fantastic,
isn't it?

149
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,750
Having your head
involuntarily turn

150
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,333
in the direction of
someone much younger

151
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,250
is a battle everyone must face.

152
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,458
That's disturbing.

153
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,916
What's wrong with you people?

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,833
Am I the only one in
GROUP who's not a lolicon?

155
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,958
Let me get this straight--

156
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,625
I'm being called a
lolicon by someone

157
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,166
who's clearly a shotacon?

158
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,333
Looks like it.

159
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,916
So true.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,583
What have I ever done
that justifies you

161
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,708
calling me a shotacon? Jerks!

162
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,708
[UNABARA] All right, so...
What kind of job is this

163
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,291
that requires all of GROUP
to be called in?

164
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,875
Oh, just your
run-of-the-mill request.

165
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,291
We're supposed to find an
outfit called "Spark Signal,"

166
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,166
who're barricaded up
with some hostages,

167
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,875
and kill them all.

168
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,500
[TAKITSUBO]
Looks like I'm okay.

169
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,791
They said I might
be discharged soon.

170
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,958
Really?

171
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:32,458
You aren't able to
use ability crystals.

172
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,666
That sucks.

173
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
But at least we know
it wasn't too serious.

174
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,375
[KINUHATA] Still, I'm
surprised you brought her

175
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,083
an ultra-flower arrangement.

176
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,541
I thought for sure it'd
be an ultra-bunny suit.

177
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,666
You're on that again? Come on.

178
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,791
[KINUHATA]
Ta-da!

179
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,750
And now for our star attraction.

180

Ultra-Bunny Rikou!

181
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:55,166
I didn't realize you were
that ultra-hot for bunny girls.

[HAMAZURA]
I'm not!

183
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,375
The air's kinda dry
in here, and, uh...

184
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,208
You'll be okay;
we're in a hospital.

185
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:01,833
A nurse should be
coming by soon.

186

00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:04,875
[HAMAZURA]
Thank you.

188

Don't worry, Hamazura.

The doctors here also offer
care for mental disorders.

191
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,708
Takitsubo should
be discharged soon.

Do you know what your
ultra-plans will be after that?

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,583
No, not yet.

194
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,583
Don't forget that ITEM
has been ultra-disbanded.

195
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,125
I'm waiting for a new team
to be ultra-organized.

196
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,375
There's ultra-no benefit
to pairing with Takitsubo

197
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,875
since she can't fight,
and there's ultra-no need

198
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,666
for you to work
with them either.

199
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,333
Yeah, I have no idea what
I'm going to do right now.

200
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:45,083
But Takitsubo needs to
get back into the world,

201
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,375
and I'm going to help her.

202
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,208
I hear what you're
saying, Hamazura.

203
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,625
You're ultra-devoting
all your time and energy

Takitsubo into a bunny suit,

Is that really
who you think I am?

Ugh! Please stop ultra-looking
at me with that disgustingly

when you're imagining

210

211
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,375
Oh, please, you really
think I'm imagining you

212
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:06,708
in a bunny suit?

213
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
You couldn't pull off
wearing one if you tried!

214
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,041
Let me be ultra-blunt with
you right now, Hamazura.

215
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,541
I happen to have an
ultra-superior figure.

216
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,875
Mine's better as
a middle-schooler

217
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,833
than Takitsubo's is
as a high-schooler!

218
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,125
You're wrong about that!

219
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,208
I know for a fact that
Takitsubo's a knockout

whenever she gets undressed!

221
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,541
I also know that if
you got undressed

222
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,000
it would be a complete snore.

223
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,583
Do you want
me to ultra-kill you?

224
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:29,583
Because it sounds like
you've got a death wish!

close to ultra-showing you

Gross!

That might be one of
the top five worst things

misfortune of hearing.

As if whatever
you've got under there

You'll never get to see, though.

is what those damn

00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,500
you must never
let your guard down.

342
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,875
Which is why we
don't meet in person.

343
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,666
You're probably hiding
in what's basically

344
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,208
a nuclear fallout shelter.

345
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,375
[SHIOKISHI] For those who have
powers like the one Musujime

346
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,291
possesses, the thickness
of walls is no obstacle.

347
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,500
Mr. Shiokishi,
help me understand

348
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,208
why a member of
the governing board

349
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,875
would go out of his way
to contact us directly.

350
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,375
[SHIOKISHI] I want you to take
down the rest of Spark Signal--

351
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:12,041
the terrorists from earlier.

352
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,166
If I said the name "DRAGON,"
would that mean anything to you?

353
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,500
[SHIOKISHI]
Sure.

354
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:19,083
Those are the scaly
creatures with wings, right?

355
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,583
[ACCELERATOR]
Tch.

356
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,583
[SHIOKISHI] The sooner you
settle this trivial business,

357
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:25,708
the sooner you can get
back to your regular lives.

358
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,375
[TSUCHIMIKADO] There are
twenty members still left.

359
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,791
[ACCELERATOR] No doubt
killing them would be easy.

360
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,625
But are we just going
to submissively do

361
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,208
whatever the damned governing
board orders us to?

362
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,208
This could be our chance
to find out exactly

363
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,291
what DRAGON is.

364
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:44,541
[TSUCHIMIKADO] So are you saying
you want to try negotiating

365
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,166
with the terrorists?

366
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,791
Because mark my words.

367
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,625
If innocent civilians will be
caught in the middle of it,

368
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,333
I promise none of us will
be there to back you up.

369
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,458
I thought you were supposed
to be off fighting terrorists

370
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,666
with a new team,
so why are you here?

371
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,166
Yeah, I was.

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,208
But then I got annoyed after
five minutes and came back.

373
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,166
They took the survivors of the
defunct ITEM, SCHOOL, BLOCK,

374
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,916
and MEMBER and created
a new team with them.

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,375
Then they were like, "I know
everyone here was trying

376
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:15,791
to kill you before, but do
your best to get along!"

377
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,583
Oh, wow, talk about shady!

378
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,125
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot:

379
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,833
the Heart Measure lady
in the dress asked me

380
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,833
to ultra-give you her regards.

381
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,416
Really? Lucky me.

382
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,625
Are you sure this
is the best idea?

383
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,000
Blowing off an order
from the higher-ups?

384
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,916
I'm probably ultra-screwed.

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,500
Hamazura, would you mind
giving me a hand with something?

386
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,666
Huh?

387
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,291
All I have to do is
completely wipe out

388
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,416
the remaining terrorists
alone before they drag me

389
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,666
back into the new team!

390
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,708
Huh?!

391
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,416
Ya know, you really are
a piece of work mooching off

392
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,416
your friends and feeling
no remorse about it.

393
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,958
Did you just ultra-say
something? I don't speak Loser.

394
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,541
[helicopter whirring]

395
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:55,208
[HAMAZURA] Great! Looks like
we've got some major bad news

396
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,458
coming up behind us!

397
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,791
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Hey!
Narrowing our avenues

398
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,583
of attack isn't
terribly helpful!

399
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,833
[crash]

400
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,541
[TSUCHIMIKADO]
They got away.

401
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,208
[ACCELERATOR] This is exactly
what you get when you cram

402
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,208
a busload of villains together.

403
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,958
And these are the
ones who shake loose?

404
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,375
If you want, I could blow them
up while I'm doing Spark Signal.

405
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,000
[HIGH SCHOOL BOY 15A]
Wait! Just a minute, please!

406
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,416
Stop! Don't use that drug!

407
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
[RESCUE WORKER 15A] I have to,
or she won't last until

408
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,791
she gets to the hospital!

409
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:49,916
[HIGH SCHOOL BOY 15A]
She's our teacher.

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,166
She's pregnant.

411
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,041
You have to save them both!

412
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,583
Please, sir!
Please, I'm begging you!

413
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,791
[ACCELERATOR]
Stand aside.

414
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,958
Sex, female.
Weight, two forty-four grams.

415
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,833
Heart rate, sixty BPM.

416
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,625
Stimulus response ratio,
coming up now as

417
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,291
five point five-two.

418
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,791
She needs a stimulant.

419
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,000
Two point five grams
of ephedrine.

420
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:20,291
Apply a topical patch
to the carotid artery

421
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,791
diffusing it in five times
for ten seconds,

422
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,083
and then take it off
for twenty more seconds.

423
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,333
That will save her.

424
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,291
Hey, wait!

425
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,416
What's going to happen to
the baby if they give her

426
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,916
that stuff you just said?

427
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,750
Do you think I did all those
calculations for no reason?

428
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,375
[HIGH SCHOOL BOY 15A]
Hold on, please wait!

429
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,125
Thank you, man.

430
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,083
She'll be all right
because of you.

431
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,416
[ACCELERATOR]
Get lost, already.

432
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,416
I promise I'll never forget
what you did tonight

433
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,000
for as long as I live.

434
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,541
Someday, I hope to be
able to return the favor.

435
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:56,666
You're an--

436
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,666
Get lost.

437
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,375
A six-winger.

438
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,041
'Kay, what does it want with us?

439
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,291
Hey! Did you know
they'd react like this

440
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,750
when you went and
disobeyed their orders?

441
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,958
It does seem like ultra-overkill
just for a single person, huh?

442
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,416
Crap! They're shooting at us!

443
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,041
Fun fact--the missiles
from the six-wingers

444
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,791
all use infrared sensors.

445
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,416
That flare just ultra-screwed
up their aim.

446
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,458
Awesome!

447
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:46,416
You need to steer
ultra-straight!

448
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Don't turn the wheel!

449
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
I'm trying to make
it more difficult

450
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,041
for them to shoot us!

451
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,958
What the hell are you doing?

452
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,458
[gunshot]

453
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:56,291
Keep your eyes ultra-on the road
and your foot on the gas!

454
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,291
Okay, but I saw your panties!

455
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,375
Be careful!

456
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,500
There's no way you
can shoot through

457
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,583
a military helicopter's armor!

458
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,958
What makes you
think I'm trying to shoot

459
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,166
through the armor?

460
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,583
I ultra-did it with
clay-based bullets.

461
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,166
I figured they would
ultra-shatter

462
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,708
and that would cause the
fragments to enter the intakes.

463
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,041
Nice panties!

464
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:23,583
Damn it! Kinuhata, use
your Offense Armor!

465
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:24,666
[KINUHATA]
Hold on!

466
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,541
[HAMAZURA]
What am I doing?

467
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,125
I need to get Kinuhata
back and go see Takitsubo.

468
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,916
[phone buzzing]

469
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:41,958
[HEART MEASURE]
It's been too long.

470
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,625
If I said this is Heart Measure,
formerly of SCHOOL,

471
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,375
would you remember who I am?

472
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,541
How the hell do you
know my phone number?

473
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,500
[HEART MEASURE]
Never mind that.

474
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,583
Is Saiai Kinuhata with you?

475
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,875
[HAMAZURA] So, you're the
ones behind all of this!

476
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,083
[HEART MEASURE]
If you hear from her,

477
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,166
will you pass on
a message for me?

478
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,833
You know those terrorists she
said she'd deal with by herself?

479
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:06,708
They've just seized a private
room in School District Three.

480
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,208
Wait, School District Three?

481
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,458
Did I hear you right?

482
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:58,791
[KAMIJO] Even if I have
to become the villain.

483
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,250
Even if I have to get
down on my hands and knees.

484
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,375
Even if someone
has to be sacrificed.

485
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,041
I will protect her.
No matter what.

486
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,750
Next time, "The Governing
Board."

487
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,500
When science and
magic cross paths,

488
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,750
a story is born.
