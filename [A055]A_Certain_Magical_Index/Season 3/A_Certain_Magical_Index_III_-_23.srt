00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,000
[INDEX] Chapter eight,
verse twenty-five.

2
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,375
Commencing purge of humans

3
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,125
who may hinder remote
access operations.

4
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,500
Completed.

5
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,083
Innocentius... disperse!

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,208
[screams]

7
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,000
Chapter ten, verse three.

8
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:13,291
Confirming effectiveness
of executing spells.

9
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,833
Determining that halting
all hostile elements

10
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,458
of vital activity is
consistently the recommended

11
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:21,125
and most effective
solution available.

12
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:28,541
[yells]

13
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,416
[INDEX]
Chapter eleven, verse two.

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,375
Identifying effective
destructive force.

15
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,166
Determining that a
rapid-fire chain of attacks,

16
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,458
without allowing full
time to recover,

17
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,541
is currently the best
known strategy.

18
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,875
Not good!

19
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,000
Um. Question three, if I may:

20
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,833
What's going on?

21
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,291
[KAMIJO]
Is that Hyoka Kazakiri?

22
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,750
Seriously? Why is she here?

23
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,500
Uh. Question four,
if you don't mind:

24
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,000
What is it, exactly?

25
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,333
Oh, her?

26
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,541
That's Hyoka Kazakiri.
She's a friend of mine.

27
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,125
A friend of yours, huh?

28
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,833
[KAMIJO] Well, actually, I'm not
sure why she's here, but...

29
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,500
...I'm definitely
going to find out.

30
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:30,416
[KAZAKIRI yells]

31
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,666
[MISHA] You must return. You
must return. You must return.

32
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,791
Return to the location
immediately.

33
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,500
Find the correct
coordinates for heaven

34
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,000
and take the original path
to the proper meeting place.

35
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,375
Return to the
location immediately.

36
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,958
[KAZAKIRI] Must be a
different form of power

37
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,416
lodged inside of that thing.

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,541
[MISHA] Return. Necessary.
Perform. Operation.

39
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:58,875
Fiamma. Utilize. Interests.
Contact. Plan. Collaboration.

40
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,250
I'm giving you a fair warning--

41
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,958
if you intend to hurt
my dear friends

42
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,541
over something like this,
then I will have no choice

43
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,625
but to use every drop of
strength I have to stop you.

44
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,875
[MISHA] Damage. Disregard.
Priority. Return. Correct.

45
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:15,750
Location. Obstacle. Evil.
Synonymous. Judgment. All.

46
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,833
[MISHA]
Capture.

47
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:27,916
Necessary. Information.
Parchment. Obtain.

48
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,916
[grunts]

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,875
Looks like the scent of this
parchment is so strong

50
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,291
it's attracting flies.

51
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,791
Detecting an incoming disaster.

52
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,708
And Misaka predicts
this one to be worse

53
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,125
than a natural hurricane.

54
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,458
What now?

55
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,666
There's a difference between
natural and manmade.

56
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,708
Only one strikes with
the intention to kill.

57
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,125
And personally, I'm much
happier with an exact target.

58
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,500
It gives me an outlet,

59
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,750
so I don't have to waste my
time being weighed down

60
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,166
by anger I can't
seem to channel.

61
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,791
Don't forget you've got
the kid in the back seat.

62
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,500
Be careful and keep her safe.

63
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,041
Jeez, come on. Seriously?

64
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,208
Don't you know that's what
Misaka is the worst at?

65
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,125
You know, you're pretty damn
lucky I've got a need for you.

66
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,666
Your potential usefulness is
the only thing keeping me

67
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,416
from ending your life after
a dumb joke like that.

68
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,166
Yeah? Perfect!

69
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
Then Misaka did something right!

70
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,333
A Russian
bacteriological weapon?

71
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:44,791
Are you absolutely certain
that's their plan?

72
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,958
'Fraid so. It's
because of the silo.

73
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,958
They don't want
Academy City to get it.

74
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,666
You have to leave,
it's dangerous here.

75
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,250
[VILLAGER 23A]
What do we do?

76
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,750
Call everyone from Academy City
who's stationed in our village?

77
00:06:58,833 --> 00:06:59,791
[HAMAZURA]
No.

78
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,166
If they were to make
any big moves,

79
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,125
the Russian army might
speed up the operation.

80
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,625
We're going to have
to do this alone.

81
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,750
Then I'm coming with you.

82
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,541
[HAMAZURA]
What if something happens to me?

83
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,375
Who will come back here
to protect the villagers?

84
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
[TAKITSUBO]
You ready, Hamazura?

85
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,416
[HAMAZURA]
Yeah.

86
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,875
[DIGURV]
Hamazura!

87
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,750
Don't get killed.

88
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,375
I'll try.

89
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,833
Bye.

90
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,166
Be careful, okay?

91
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,375
[HAMAZURA]
Yep!

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,166
[gasps]

93
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,958
Well, we can't say this
thing doesn't work.

94
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,041
Those wings you're
controlling are constructed

95
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,500
from aggregated
A-I-M diffusion fields.

96
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,666
Who are you?

97
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,750
I'm quite impressed that
a powerful monster

98
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,875
such as yourself has
the mental capacity

99
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:13,250
to conduct an interview
with me right now.

100
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,750
Be straight with me--

101
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,250
the scent of this thing brought
you here, too, didn't it?

102
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,458
Tch. What a cocky bastard.

103
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,375
Is that supposed to
be an introduction?

104
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,375
What?

105
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,500
I'll have to deal
with you later.

106
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,208
I have a feeling that
the key element I need

107
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,250
to save the kid is,
unfortunately,

108
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,166
in the hands of that other
monster down there.

109
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,083
Maybe I shouldn't use the
term monster so loosely.

110
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,375
You guys aren't
as bad as Aiwass.

111
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,208
[MISHA] Preparing, preparing,
preparing, preparing,

112
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,666
preparing, preparing.

113
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,375
We're at range and set to go.

114
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,250
Our preparations... complete.

115
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,458
[gasps]

116
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,666
[MISHA]
Command. Sweep. Drop.

117
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,666
[choking]

118
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,333
Damn you.

119
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,166
[ACCELERATOR]
What the hell was that about?

120
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,083
One blast wasn't
enough for you, huh?

121
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,166
Well, screw you, then.

122
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,583
I can't afford to risk
dying because of you.

123
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:53,125
Not when justice for the
kid hasn't been served.

124
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,083
I won't rest until I end
the cause of her pain.

125
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,250
It doesn't even matter to me
if I can defeat you here or not!

126
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,708
You've given me a reason to
try, and that's all I need!

127
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,458
[MISHA]
Second wave attack is now ready.

128
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,083
We have 30 seconds to sweep
before we redrop the fuel.

129
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,875
Second wave attack is now ready.

130
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
Is that really all you've got?

131
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,083
If neither one of you has
the strength to stop me,

132
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:27,250
then I guess, my Sweeps
will blanket the world.

133
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,166
[FIAMMA]
Long time no see, Acqua.

134
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,416
Are you still claiming to be a
corner of the Right Seat of God?

135
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,958
Or have you given up

136
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,375
and gone back to making
your way as a mercenary?

137
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
[ACQUA] It doesn't matter
how you label me.

138
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:50,208
As long as I'm in a position
to put an end to your tyranny.

139
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:53,541
[FIAMMA] Oh, really?
And how would you do that?

140
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,208
You can't be that ignorant as
to how this war got started.

141
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,416
I may be the one who
pulled the trigger,

142
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,250
but a bullet doesn't fire
without a little gunpowder,

143
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:03,583
now does it?

144
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,041
[ACQUA] I see, and you feel
that's reason enough

145
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,583
to turn an archangel loose
on innocent people?

146
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,125
[FIAMMA]
Are you going to stop me?

147
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,416
Then ultimately, your solution
is to resort to force.

148
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,041
However, your power
is not strong enough

149
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,791
to control an archangel.

150
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,125
You have my blessing to continue

151
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,291
trying to fight the
good fight, of course,

152
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,375
but I do think watching
from the sidelines

153
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,291
would be more advisable.

154
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,000
[ACQUA]
Is that so?

155
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:32,083
[ACQUA]
In that case,

156
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,000
allow me to use a method
that doesn't rely on force.

157
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,000
[FIAMMA]
What did you do?

158
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,041
Wait a minute.

159
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,958
[ACQUA]
It seems you've forgotten.

160
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,958
I am Acqua of the Rear.

161
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,958
Member of the Right Seat of God,

162
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,916
known as the darkest
organization

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,750
within the Roman Orthodoxy.

164
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:01,625
And he who presides over
the archangel Gabriel.

165
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,250
How dare you try that!

166
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,375
[FIAMMA] You took the
telesma inside of you?

167
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,125
[ACQUA] If I were to siphon
the water element

168
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,500
telesma into myself,

169
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,416
one could only imagine
what would happen

170
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,791
to the Archangel Gabriel,
as it's the source of its power.

171
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,833
[FIAMMA]
You must be out of your mind.

172
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,416
[ACQUA] It's not a
difficult task, you know.

173
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,333
After all, the nun you tried
to use from the Russian church

174
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,083
was able to do it.

175
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
[FIAMMA]
You idiot.

176
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,166
That's only because
she had the grounding

177
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,250
and tolerance required
to begin with.

178
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,916
[ACQUA] You're completely
missing the point.

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,541
If someone like her can
do it, then so can I.

180
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,833
That's all there is to it.

181
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,833
[FIAMMA]
Whatever you say.

182
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,541
Go ahead and try.

183
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,125
But keep in mind
that you're only

184
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,958
putting your own life at risk
by doing something so foolish.

185
00:12:54,583 --> 00:13:00,541
[groaning]

186
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,916

He managed to take roughly
half of her telesma,

189
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,625
but there's plenty available
for me to prevail.

190
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:37,250
Therefore, your life
will be lost for nothing.

191
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:40,416
[FIAMMA]
Kill him, Misha Kruezhev.

192
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,708
Bastard.

193
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,583
[yelling]

194
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,250
[KAMIJO] The timing of Misha
Kruezhev's appearance

195
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,500
is notable.

196
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,166
It was after the Star
of Bethlehem popped up.

197
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,125
If Fiamma was able
to utilize the power

198
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,583
of archangels this whole time,

199
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,333
he could've completed
his goal of destruction

200
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,833
without ever needing to start
World War Three, but he didn't.

201
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,041
It wasn't until this appeared.

202
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,333
The Star of Bethlehem is what
enabled him to summon

203
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,458
and sustain that
powerful archangel.

204
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,666
That makes things
easier to understand.

205
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's see.

206
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,875
I bet Misha's life support
is somewhere in here.

207
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,583
And once I find it, I'll
smash it with my right hand!

208
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:57,833
[gasps]

209
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,458
That wasn't enough!

210
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,750
What else do I have to do, huh?

211
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:15,208
[MISHA screams]

212
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,833
It's a mass of energy.

213
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,791
Stop, or you'll explode!

214
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,166
[ACCELERATOR] I don't care
if I'm a fair match

215
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,583
for this thing or not.

216
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,625
That isn't the issue here!

217
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,166
I am not going to make
this decision for you.

218
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,833
Call it arrogance or
whatever you want.

219
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:32,541
You're the only one who can
decide if she's worth it.

220
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,166
No one else can tell
you what to do!

221
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
[ACCELERATOR]
She is worth it.

222
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't lose her. I will
fight to protect her!

223
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,875
I don't even want to
think of another option!

224
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,166
I've made up my mind.

225
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,666
If keeping her safe
means risking my life,

226
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll dive head first
into this nightmare,

227
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,541
and finally face my reality!

228
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,250
Hey, don't let me
fall back there!

229
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:21,291
[yelling]

230
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,666
[ACQUA]
I think that's good enough.

231
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:35,000
As long as we find a way to
eliminate the archangel Gabriel,

232
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,666
the war will shift dramatically.

233
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,250
Fiamma, you will soon
see that you've placed

234
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,708
too much confidence
in your own strength.

235
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,666
You battle alone.

236
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,791
You've forgotten that
people will join hands

237
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,000
with like-minded strangers
to fight a great enemy.

238
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,333
You don't understand
that the choice

239
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,333
can be made for one to
hand over the torch of war

240
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:59,125
to others who share
a common goal.

241
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:03,166
Indeed, much as I once did.

242
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,125
Death will find me soon.

243
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,666
I will take the archangel
down with me.

244
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,000
As long as it provides a
future full of joy for others,

245
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:12,708
I will be fulfilled.

246
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,000
[HAMAZURA]
Damn it!

247
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,333
Come on, stay with us!

248
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,625
Can you hear me?

249
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,041
What happened to you?

250
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,958
Takitsubo! He needs first aid!

251
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,583
[ACQUA]
No, don't bother.

252
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,666
I won't survive in any case.

253
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,958
You shut your mouth!

254
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:34,000
[ACQUA]
Please, go. Leave me here.

255
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:37,583
The goal for my life has
already been accomplished.

256
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,041
Any effort you make to
keep me in this world now

257
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,541
will only slow you down.

258
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,125
[HAMAZURA]
Oh, come on!

259
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,125
What am I supposed to do about
all the people waiting for you?

260
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,333
Aren't they part of everything

261
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,333
you've spent your entire
life fighting for?

262
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:51,583
You've done everything you can

263
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,041
to have masses of
people follow you,

264
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,625
and they're still here!

265
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,958
If your only reason for
fighting is something so lame

266
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,625
as stepping in front of
a crowd of citizens

267
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,791
with tears in their eyes

268
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,208
and seeing smiles
appear because of you,

269
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:03,750
then you're not done!

270
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,250
So, it's time! Get up!

271
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,166
Get up, hero!

00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,333
That's how it is? You're
not going to cooperate?

Well, fine. Screw you, you
worthless piece of crap!

275
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,291
Thanks to Gabriel's
perceptive skills,

276
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:45,166
I've acquired the information
I need from the parchment.

277
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,375
Almost there.

[FIAMMA] You like making
things difficult, don't you?

282
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,375
I guess I'll have to
complete this ritual

283
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,958
sooner than I expected.

284
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,666
You think I'm going to allow
you to proceed that easily?

285
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,000
The people have conquered
your archangel.

286
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,375
So no matter how
you choose spin it,

287
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,333
the scales have
tipped in our favor!

288
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,000
I wouldn't exactly say that.

289
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,416
[FIAMMA]
The angel's defeat matters not.

290
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,833
Her role came to an end

291
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,916
the moment she changed
the night sky to my liking.

292

The Star of Bethlehem
now flies alone

in a telesma-filled,
incomplete sky,

294
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,041
as part of a ceremony to
reconfigure the four elements.

[KAMIJO]
What? What are you trying to do?

296
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,250
This is all just a
means to an end, see?

297
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,291
What really counts
is my right arm.

298
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,791
Everything comes down to this.

299
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,125
Fire, water, wind, and earth.

300
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,250
By controlling these
four elements,

301
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:59,916
I would be gaining a tremendous
amount of magical power.

302
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,291
However, I am being held back

303
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,916
by the distortion of elements
in the world at large.

304
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,791
And proper power is something
that can only be exercised

to its fullest
in a proper world.
