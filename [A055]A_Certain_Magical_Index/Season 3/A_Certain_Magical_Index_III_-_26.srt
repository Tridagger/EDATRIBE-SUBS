put her through.

176
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,375
You think I'd let her
suffer a minute longer?

177
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,666
[yells]

178
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:31,000
[SISTER 10A] Third magical
item confirmed destroyed.

179
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,750
[STIYL] Strange. There's
something huge out there.

180
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,666
Telesma? What's it doing there?

181
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,041
It looks like Misha Kruezhev

182
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,583
is advancing toward
the Arctic Ocean!

183
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,000
[gasps]

184
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,333
[SISTER 10B] Reading a line of
telesma between the two.

185
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,708
Reciprocal interference is
definitely being generated.

186
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,625
What now?

187
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,333
I mean, it can't be a new power.

188
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,875
So, is she trying to restore
herself physically?

189
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,291
[KAMIJO]
What do you mean?

190
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,916
[STIYL] Misha Kruezhev
presides over water.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,708
If she uses the polar ice cap,

192
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,875
including special
symbols and emblems,

193
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,833
her power will
become even greater.

194
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,083
But there's a possibility that

195
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,458
if she tries to elicit
too much power,

196
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:13,166
the very body that Misha is
composed of will explode,

197
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,041
and a great deal of
telesma will be released.

198
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,958
[STIYL]
How do we stop her now?

199
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,958
We weren't even sure we
could stop the old Misha,

200
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:29,250
and that was with an
organized response.

201
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,916
[SISTER 10A]
The Star of Bethlehem.

202
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,083
It's deviated from
its earlier course!

203
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,291
[STIYL]
What?

204
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,666
[STIYL]
Don't tell me. He's--

205
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:19,541
[KAMIJO] Sure, the world as
we know it may perish someday.

206
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:24,041
But... it doesn't have to be
a tragic ending like this.

207
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:26,208
I'll fight to keep
that from happening,

208
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,666
and no one can
tell me it's wrong!

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,041
Damn. I can't find anything.

210
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,375
I need something.

211
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,833
A bargaining chip to
negotiate with them.

212
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,458
Hamazura, we need
to get out of here.

213
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,208
They'll be coming for us.

214
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,458
[HAMAZURA]
I know. Just a few more minutes.

215
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,041
[MUGINO] Use my blood
as an insurance policy.

216
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,375
[BOTH gasp]

217
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,875
[MUGINO]
The fourth-ranked DNA map.

218
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,375
As long as all three
of us are carrying it,

219
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,958
we should be able to
keep them in check.

220
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:29,041
Mugino.

221
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,041
[HELMETED WOMAN]
Honestly.

222
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,458
You really are a great
deal of trouble.

223
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,708
Who are you?

224
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,416
[HELMETED WOMAN]
Your ally.

225
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,416
Perhaps you'll recognize
me from my work

226
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,458
up the chain of command?

227
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,458
What is it she always says?

228
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,958
[HELMETED WOMAN] "It's always
like this with you."

229
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,875
My top-priority objective
is Riko Takitsubo.

230
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,125
It's a relief to secure her.

231
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,500
[HAMAZURA]
Takitsubo is your priority?

232
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,500
[HELMETED WOMAN]
You mean you didn't notice?

233
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,000
I suppose you were
a bit distracted.

234
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,625
When you fought those
masked assailants,

235
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:05,000
Riko Takitsubo affected Shizuri
Mugino's personal Reality.

236
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,625
Are you saying--?

237
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,291
[HELMETED WOMAN]
She is already indicated as such

238
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,416
on the Parameter List,
but she has the potential

239
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,291
to become something
extraordinary

240
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,250
known as the "eighth."

241
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,416
If her evolution continues,

242
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,166
she could eventually become
capable of providing all

243
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,791
of Academy City's functionality
entirely on her own.

244
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,416
A so-called
"Academy Individual."

245
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,000
[HAMAZURA]
Hold on.

246
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,416
You're telling us you
knew all this already?

247
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,541
That no matter how hard we try,

248
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,375
there are those who
are fated to succeed

249
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,541
and those who are
doomed to fail?

250
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,500
[MUGINO] Takitsubo and I
have gone down this road

251
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,041
on our own and faced
the consequences.

252
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,958
But Hamazura isn't like us.

253
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,416
If he'd been given a fair shake,

254
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,166
then things could've
turned out differently.

255
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,583
Mugino.

256
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,416
[HELMETED WOMAN] Not the
reaction I'd expect from you.

257
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,125
Tell me, when did you start
sympathizing with weaklings?

258
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,708
[MUGINO]
Shut up.

259
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:00,750
It's okay.

260
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,666
The three of us are still ITEM,

261
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,875
and that's not something
I'm ever gonna regret.

262
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,333
So it's okay!

263
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,083
[gunshots]

264
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,875
[HELMETED WOMAN gasps]

265
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,958
Hamazura, you all right?

266
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,708
Yeah, thanks to you.
You guys timed that perfectly.

267
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,708
[HELMETED WOMAN]
Why?

268
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,166
We're not in Academy
City anymore.

269
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,125
I may be a Level Zero,

270
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,666
but out here I was able to
rely on the help of others

271
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,583
in order to survive.

272
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,958
[HELMETED WOMAN] Reinforcements
will be here soon.

273
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,375
Nothing about the
situation has changed.

274
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,041
I know that.

275
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,375
[HAMAZURA]
Now, then.

276
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,916
What you mentioned earlier,
this "Parameter List."

277
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,166
[HAMAZURA] You're going
to tell me everything

278
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,666
you know about it.

279
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,708
I'll show you just how
cruel a person can be.

280
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:03,666
So long as they can excuse it as
protecting the ones they love.

281
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:10,250
[MALE PILOT 26A] This is the
recovery team. Target secured.

282
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:13,083
Now heading to the rendezvous
point with the main unit.

283
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
What did you do with the kids?

284
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,416
[MALE RESEARCHER 26A]
Another unit has them.

285
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,208
I want you to give me
your word, right now.

286
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,291
There'll be no more hiding
behind the kid or the Sisters.

287
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,541
You can do your own dirty work.

288
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:31,541
Do not toy around with a single
one of their lives any further.

289
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,166
And that goes for other
people like me, too.

290
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,541
I won't permit you to force us

291
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,458
to do jobs for the
underworld anymore.

292
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:40,791
[MALE RESEARCHER 26B]
You don't seem to understand

293
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,333
what's going on.

294
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,916
Huh? See, now that's where
you're wrong, Goggles.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,208
You're the one who doesn't
seem to understand.

296
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,416
[MALE RESEARCHER 26B] Hey. His
switch is turned off, isn't it?

297
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,583
[MALE RESEARCHER 26C]
Uh, yeah, it should be.

298
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,250
[MALE RESEARCHER 26A]
Double check it.

299
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,125
[MALE RESEARCHER 26B gasps]

300
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,166
This isn't a negotiation,
a suggestion,

301
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,000
a trade, or a request.

302
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a triumphant return,
you sons of bitches.

303
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,041
[banging]

304
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,666
[FIAMMA]
No. It can't be.

305
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,625
Aleister Crowley?

306
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,666
[ALEISTER] It's good to see
I'm well known enough

307
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,416
to be recognized
outside of my tank.

308
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,083
[FIAMMA]
But why?

309
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,541
You may not have understood
what you were doing,

310
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,083
but you went after that right
hand a bit too enthusiastically.

311
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,083
If only you'd seen Imagine
Breaker as nothing

312
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,916
but an extraordinary tool for
negating extraordinary powers.

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,416
Unfortunately, you got a glimpse
of its true nature, didn't you?

314
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,708
That's a loose end
I can't allow.

315
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,375
[FIAMMA] What do you mean,
"its true nature"?

316
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,375
I'm sure you must have guessed.

317
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,083
And though your plan
may ultimately

318
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,666
have been unsuccessful

319
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,875
how is it any different
from Academy City,

320
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,583
a world with a certain sort of
power enclosed within it?

321
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,791
I see, so in my own way,

322
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,416
I've actually managed
to come close

323
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,125
to touching the truth at
the heart of the world.

324
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,708
I can tell from the
look on your face,

325
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,250
all of my recent efforts
have been futile.

326
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,083
Yours isn't the
expression of someone

327
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:43,250
who truly wishes
to save the world.

328
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,291
He stood, and he fought.

329
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,458
And in that moment,
he was utterly untouchable.

330
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,916
[ALEISTER] I really don't think
that's going to work.

331
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:03,583
It isn't a question of
whether or not I can do this.

332
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:04,916
I have to.

333
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,458
I won't let you trample
what he fought to protect!

334
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,916
Do you know where your
failure really lies?

335
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,541
I will tell you.

336
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,416
You thought you could explain
that right hand and Kamijo,

337
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,625
the Purifier of God,

338
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,250
with no more than the
church of the cross.

339
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,208
How very foolish.

340
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,250
I'm reading something here.

341
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,875
This wavelength, I recognize it.

342
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,666
It belongs to Aleister Crowley!

343
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,125
[LAURA]
Oh. So he is alive.

344
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:45,750
Well, then, seems things are
about to get very interesting.

345
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:49,208
Chairman of the
governing board. Aleister.

346
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,083
You seem to be enjoying this.

347
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,666
[AIWASS]
Yes. I find it quite pleasant.

348
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,291
Or, to be more precise,

349
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,541
I'm delighted that this pleasant
time will be prolonged.

350
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,875
He has done surprisingly well.

351
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,000
It was less about purging me

352
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,625
and more about making a shift
into a different domain.

353
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,541
I think you would be better off

354
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,291
if you spent a little bit more
time getting to know humans.

355
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:22,500
Underestimate them, and you
just might find yourself

356
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,208
stabbed through
the heart someday.

357
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
[AIWASS]
What are you saying?

358
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,625
Humans are such
delicate creatures.

359
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,625
I suspect my heart
is entirely safe.

360
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,541
That said, if one of them
actually did manage to wound me,

361
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,916
well, can you think of
anything more fascinating?

362
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,833
[gasps]

363
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:03,208
[SILVIA] Hmm. It looks
like he's still alive.

364
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,875
[OLLERUS] You don't want your
life to end like this, do you?

365
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,916
Tell me everything
you saw and heard.

366
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,250
Who're you?

367
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,291
My name is Ollerus.

368
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:20,583
I was almost a Magic
God once. Came close.

369
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,583
But then I was unseated
by the One-Eyed Othinus.

370
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,666
A wretched sorcerer.

371
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,875
I have good news.

372
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,333
We have looked
over the conditions

373
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,791
presented to us by Academy City,

374
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,541
and have agreed to a seat
at the conference table.

375
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,208
So, as of this moment,
I declare that all hostilities

376
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,666
are officially at an end.

377
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,333
This decision was reached with
the cooperation of all parties,

378
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,041
and it is my sincere hope
that it will be recorded

379
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,083
in the history of a
future world at peace

380
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,041
as having been correct.

381
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,958
Huh...

382
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,375
You know, you've got
awfully good luck

383
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,458
for somebody who
claims it's rotten.

384
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:10,166
Toma Kamijo.
