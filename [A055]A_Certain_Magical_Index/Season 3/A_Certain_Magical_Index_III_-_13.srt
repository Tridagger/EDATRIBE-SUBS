[KAMIJO, FLORIS panting]

2
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you okay?
It looks like we managed to

3
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:46,791
successfully get away from them.

4
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,750
Uh... huh?!

5
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,208
Successfully?! If you mean
despite plunging into the water

6
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,041
and bouncing all over the
place while spinning around,

7
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,458
then sure--what a success!

8
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,916
Hey. We're still here.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,541
We're alive, aren't we?
And safe, safe!

10
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,125
Huh? You think we're safe?

11
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,750
That isn't the issue here!

[horse galloping]

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,250
Are those horse hooves?

14
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:12,750
They found us!

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,291
Oh, it's you.

16
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,875
[KAMIJO]
You're the third princess.

17
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,583
[AMAKUSA MEMBER 13A]
I've located the third princess.

18
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,208
[TATEMIYA] Outstanding.
Hurry and escort her here.

19
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,541
[AMAKUSA MEMBER 13A]
The thing is...

20
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,916
So you're saying the
Imagine Breaker is with her?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,458
What on earth could possibly
be going on over there?

22
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,250
Tell me, have you ever
heard of the Norse warrior

23
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,666
they call Thororm?

24
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,125
He used magic,
and allegedly had the power

25
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:27,458
to cancel out the sharpness
of his enemy's swords.

26
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,416
Wait, you can't mean...

27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,625
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Taking a page from this legend,

28
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,541
I've formulated a spell that
zeroes out the attack force

29
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,291
of anything I might
recognize as a weapon.

30
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,833
That is, after I took a brutal
sneak attack at Dover long ago.

31
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,500
[ACQUA grunts]

32
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:52,916
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

33
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,291
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

34
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,083
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

35
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,375
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,333
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

37
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,166
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Zero out!

38
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,500
That again?
I zeroed this out earlier.

39
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,291
Does this mean you're running
out of tricks already?

40
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,166
History is currently
on the move.

41
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,750
Unless you can turn back time,

42
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,333
it is abundantly clear which
leader has what it takes

43
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,416
to be the most beneficial
to the country!

44
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,791
So why cling so tenaciously
to that powerless

45
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,458
and pathetic Third Princess?

46
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,250
You still don't
understand, do you?

47
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,625
[KNIGHT LEADER]
It can't be.

48
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,541
[KNIGHT LEADER]
It just can't be!

49
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,833
The three animals
on the coat of arms.

50
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,750
The royalty, the knights,
and the puritans.

51
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,625
The fields of blue symbolizing
England, Scotland, Wales,

52
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:58,083
and Northern Ireland--
the entirety of Great Britain.

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,833
Are you serious?

54
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,083
Do you truly not see the
absurdity of a plan like that?

55
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,875
You want to strive
for a perfect harmony

56
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,166
within the body of the United
Kingdom with the queen

57
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,958
and the three sisters,
and without anyone else

58
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,791
there to support you?

59
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,208
As I said before...

60
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,375
Why talk when you can fight?

61
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,291
A true warrior
acts on his beliefs

62
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,875
rather than
speaking about them.

63
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:28,083
[KNIGHT LEADER screaming]

64
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:31,041
[ACQUA yells]

65
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,083
Zero out!

66
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,416
[KNIGHT LEADER]
He launched that himself?

67
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,916
But once I've noticed it
and recognize it as a weapon,

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,958
it's over!

69
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,041
Zero out!

70
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,750
[KNIGHT LEADER]
Is there enough time?

71
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,791
Zero out!

72
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:04,041
[KNIGHT LEADER] How many
hidden blades do you have?

73
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,708
Imagine meeting the
same fate as Thororm.

74
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,875
In the same way ten years ago,

75
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,458
being bested by
another sneak attack.

76
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,125
[ACQUA] Well, I am a shameless,
washed-up mercenary scoundrel.

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,125
I can fight with wild abandon

78
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,333
in a way you stiff
knights never could.

79
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,041
But as fate would have it,

80
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,791
I do not have a blade
in my possession

81
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,708
with which to
kill an old friend.

82
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,291
[KNIGHT 13A]
The captain! Fall back!

83
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,416
[KAMIJO] I've got a nasty
feeling that won't go away,

84
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,958
but I'm not gonna get
anywhere unless I keep moving.

85
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,375
Luckily, the Amakusa are
guarding the Third Princess now.

86
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,708
[KAMIJO gasps]

87
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,791
Quite a devil of a face
to come across once again.

88
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,208
It's Acqua?

89
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,041
But how?

90
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,333
He's still alive.

91
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,250
Is that Index?

92
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:13,666
If rescuing her is your goal,
then get it done quickly.

93
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,208
In some ways, the danger here
is greater than in London,

94
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,875
though the city
has already fallen.

95
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,916
[CARISSA] Huh. The Knight Leader
has been vanquished, has he?

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,958
You're causing me so much grief.

97
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,916
I'm overwhelmed, honestly.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,833
And functioning without
my vanguard means

99
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,708
I'll just have to deal with
you bottom feeders myself.

100
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,000
Not to worry,
your grief will end soon.

101
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,083
Because your coup d'état
is about to come to an end

102
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,500
right here and now.

103
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,000
I advise you not
to underestimate me.

104
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,833
I have the Curtana Original
in my hand right now,

105
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,291
so don't you forget it!

106
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,458
[KAMIJO]
Whoa...!

107
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,333
Now, ordinarily, this is
something that separates

108
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,708
the United Kingdom from
the rest of the planet.

109
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,375
That is to say,
it manages and governs it.

110
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,666
But by applying
its special attributes,

111
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,333
it can do this as well.

112
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,791
When you cut through
three-dimensional matter,

113
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,166
its cross-section
becomes two-dimensional.

114
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,458
And if it's two-dimensional,

115
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,125
the cross-section will
become one-dimensional.

116
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,208
In the same way, if you
cut through a dimension

117
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,625
of space higher than
three dimensions,

118
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,625
its cross-section is
put out into the world

119
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,166
in three-dimensional form.

120
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,541
In other words...

121
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,791
I hold the power to produce
cross-sectional wreckage

122
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,000
of this level any time I want.

123
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,208
It's a pan-dimensional
fragmentation spell.

124
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:41,125
However, there is
a drawback to it.

125
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,875
This spell makes it way too
easy to put an end to things.

126
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,291
So it's just not as
fun as it could be.

127
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,958
Damn.

128
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,250
I need some time.

129
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,875
Keep her occupied.

130
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,500
While you do that,
I'll smash her item

131
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,875
with my right hand.

132
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,416
[CARISSA]
Oh, how frightening.

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,375
If I recall correctly,
your patented move

134
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,833
was called Imagine Breaker,
was it not?

135
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,708
In that case, allow me to
show you an applied technique.

136
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,083
It's perfect for it!

137
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,583
[KAMIJO grunting]

138
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,958
[KAMIJO yelling]

139
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,208
[KAMIJO]
Damn it! What now?

140
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,708
Hold on, Index!

141
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,958
[ACQUA] Grab onto me,
unless you'd prefer to die.

142
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,208
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

143
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:56,791
[ACQUA]
Here. Catch.

144
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

145
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,708
But why'd you save us?

146
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,875
I had to.

147
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,666
The one who was
responsible for the union

148
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,291
between the Roman Orthodoxy
and the Russian Church

149
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,208
is called Fiamma of the Right.

150
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,958
Wait, Fiamma of the Right?

151
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,833
That is correct, and he
has a plan in place

152
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:17,083
that relies upon two things:
your right arm

153
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,958
and the wisdom of the
List of Prohibited Books

154
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,875
needed to fully
exploit its powers,

155
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:23,041
which left me no choice.

156
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,125
Make sense?

157
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,625
Saving one of you
without the other

158
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,375
would make the plan ineffective.

159
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,750
Fiamma would be sent
into a panic if he lost

160
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,375
both key elements.

161
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,291
And that in and of
itself would carry the risk

162
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:36,791
of even more senseless
destruction spreading.

163
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,208
So here we are.

164
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,583
I have no other choice
but to destroy the scourge

165
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,625
within the scourge.

166
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,541
However, the need arose
to quickly put an end

167
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,000
to this petty quarrel.

168
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,250
A quarrel that spun off
of the actual scourge

169
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:53,083
before I ever had a chance
to attack, you see?

170
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,791
Wait, a petty quarrel?

171
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,333
You mean the coup d'état?

172
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,250
I don't understand.

173
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,500
Can it be stopped?

174
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,958
Carissa and the knights' new
order relies solely on Curtana.

175
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,666
Which means they're
more vulnerable

176
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,083
with only one true weapon.

177
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,166
But striking at weaknesses
is not how I operate.

178
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,958
I don't have to trick anyone.

179
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,875
I challenge my opponents
upfront, out in the open.

180
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:20,958
[gun fires]

181
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,416
[KAMIJO]
Acqua of the Rear. Damn.

182
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,291
[KAMIJO]
Index! Are you okay?

183
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,541
Are you hurt anywhere?

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,041
Toma, are you the one who
rescued me from the knights?

185
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,458
You'd think so, right?

186
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,250
I only wish things had
worked out as easily as that.

187
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:46,375
Oh!

188
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,791
Well then, that must
mean you came here

189
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,041
with yet another girl
you've known for ten seconds.

190
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,500
You'd think so, right?

191
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:54,375
I only wish things had
worked out as easily as that.

192
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,166
I'm glad to see you're
still your usual self.

193
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,125
Um... Toma, I'm hungry.

194
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,333
Will you feed me?

195
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,541
Maybe too much your usual self.

196
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,291
[aircraft approaching]

197
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,416
[KAMIJO] Prevent Curtana
Original from functioning?

198
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,541
We received a report
that the Second Princess

199
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
has just returned
to Buckingham Palace.

200
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,500
It can be assumed
that the reason for this

201
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,125
is because Curtana Original's
power is too great

202
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,375
and therefore unstable
and in need of fine tuning.

203
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,750
Then now's our chance.

204
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,666
With Knight Leader defeated,
the alliance is fragile.

205
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,166
The knights and
the Second Princess

206
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,750
were only ever united
by mutual interest.

207
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,208
If we can eliminate Curtana,

208
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,208
then this coup d'état
will fall apart.

209
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:58,375
Acqua did mention something
about how the knights

210
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,416
and the princess were
vulnerable because their plans

211
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,791
were centered solely on Curtana.

212
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:06,041
Do you think shutting Curtana
down is really a possibility?

213
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,416
There's a subway
under Buckingham Palace.

214
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,125
[KANZAKI] There was a backup
system created in a rarely-used

215
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,583
underground branch line.

216
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,583
A special car with magic
cast on it is standing by.

217
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:20,041
It will activate should
Curtana ever get out of control.

218
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Essentially, it's a failsafe
put into place in order

219
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,291
to check the sword's power.

220
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:26,500
We believe Carissa returned
because she needed

221
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,375
this system to counter
Curtana's growing instability.

222
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,666
[KANZAKI] We plan to use
this to our advantage.

223
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
We'll forcibly disrupt Curtana
Original via the subway,

224
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,083
and then expend a tremendous
amount of magic power

225
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,291
from the English Puritan's
aerial fortress

226
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,458
to cast a large-scale
flash spell.

227
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,458
This should stimulate the
sword to run away with itself.

228
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,500
I see.

229
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,916
I mean, I don't
really understand

230
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,375
the exact theory behind it,

231
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,500
but if you say it works,
then I'm all in.

232
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,666
I apologize.
I didn't expect that,

233
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,625
and it's quite a relief to
know we have your support.

234
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
The truth is, you see,
there are very few people

235
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,125
who'd be able to
carry out this mission.

236
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,708
[MIKOTO]
I wonder...

237
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,583
What is going on
with this restaurant?

238
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,750
I just came in here
today by chance.

239
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,583
It's like touring
Big-boob country!

240
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,041
Wait a minute!

241
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,208
If everyone in here looks
that way, then maybe there's

242
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,083
something in the food
that makes you grow!

243
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,708
[phone buzzing]

244
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,041
[coughing]

245
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,458
[MIKOTO] Seriously?
What does he want?

246
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,041
Why in the world would
that idiot be calling me?

247
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,750
Yeah, hello?

248
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,250
[KAMIJO]
Sorry to bother you, Misaka,

249
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,125
but I need to sneak
into a subway.

250
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,708
Do you know how to open an
electronic shutter door lock?

251
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,041
[MIKOTO]
Ugh.

252
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,625
[KAMIJO] Sorry to bother
you, Misaka! But I need--

253
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,708
I heard you,
but I was ignoring it!

254
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,000
Get a clue, you idiot!

255
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,250
Okay, tell me:

256
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,125
Why do you need to break
into a train station?

257
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,083
And where are you, anyway?

258
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:23,875
[KAMIJO]
London.

259
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,083
[MIKOTO]
Huh?

260
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you have any idea
what kind of crazy hoops

261
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,333
you'd have to jump
through just to get out

262
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,791
of Academy City?

263
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,875
[MIKOTO] But then again,
wasn't he in France earlier?

264
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,875
[KAMIJO] I know it sounds
weird, but I'm in London.

265
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,583
And I really am staring
at a shutter door

266
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,125
that I need to get through.

267
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,541
You'll need to tell me
what kind of lock it is.

268
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,250
[KAMIJO] You know, the fact
that we've made it this far

269
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,708
so easily confirms that
the strength of London's

270
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,583
security network is stacked
more towards magic.

271
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,125
Yes, so it would seem.

272
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:00,125
Oh, well, Index and I are
disconnected from magic,

273
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,375
so we won't set anything off.

274
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,291
But you're a British
princess, aren't you?

275
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,708
I am, which does mean I've
acquired a certain level

276
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,625
of education as a member
of the royal family.

277
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,000
But as far as magic goes,

278
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,000
I refused to obtain
any knowledge or skills

279
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,000
that could be applied
toward violence.

280
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,916
Sorry. I can't help.

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I was asking because
the subway partition

282
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,875
has to be opened by
someone with royal blood,

283
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,833
so I thought you
could give it a try?

284
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,958
Ah! Well, I don't have
much experience,

285
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,083
but if Index will help me,
I will certainly do my best.

286
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you. I appreciate it.

287
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,625
Hey, Toma,

288
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,708
I'm detecting some sort
of marking in this area

289
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,208
that was created using magic.

290
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,958
If I had to guess, I'd say it's
probably so sorcerers

291
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:46,000
who maintain a magical item
can keep track of this location.

292
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,083
Oh, yeah?

293
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,666
What are those?

294
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,625
[INDEX]
Toma!

295
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
Stay back there. I'm serious!

296
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,083
That magical item is
based on the construction

297
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,583
of the Mökkurkálfi
used to fight Thor!

298
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:08,875
It's a fabricated clay
giant from Norse mythology!

299
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:09,916
[KAMIJO grunts]

300
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,958
Damn it! Did I get him?

301
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,791
[KAMIJO]
Come on! Really?!

302
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,333
[KAMIJO]
This is bad... I can't move!

303
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,541
Toma!

304
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:27,916
[VILIAN yelling]

305
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,333
[VILIAN] This trap is probably
simpler than it seems.

306
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,041
I bet my sister could
set it with less magic

307
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,875
than she holds
in her little finger.

308
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,250
No matter.

309
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,458
That's not the issue here.

310
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,875
If even the smallest amount
of force will harm those

311
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,625
who are trying to support me...

312
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,666
[KAMIJO gasps]

313
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,333
[VILIAN]
I will resist it!

314
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,375
I will resist it
to the bitter end!

315
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,791
I'll do whatever it takes!

316
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,791
C-A-O!

317
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,833
M-Y-R-A-T-T-R!

318
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,500
You must obey the one who
bears the blood of royalty!

319
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,375
I demand you open up at once!

320
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,833
[KAMIJO]
Thanks. You saved me, Vilian.

321
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,583
I can handle it from here.

322
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,416
I'll stop him
for good this time!

323
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,083
[KAMIJO yells]

324
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,333
We did it.

325
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,166
[phone buzzing]

326
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,500
[ITSUWA] Oh, thank
goodness I got through!

327
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
Itsuwa? Is that you?

328
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,166
[ITSUWA]
The mission was a success!

329
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,083
Thanks to Princess Vilian
releasing the lock

330
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:49,791
on the magic partition,
we found the special car

331
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,125
and were able to access
its power source!

332
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,583
But that's why I'm calling.

333
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,833
[KAMIJO]
Huh?

334
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,666
[ITSUWA] You have to get
out of there right away!

335
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,000
[CARISSA coughs]

336
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,958
[CARISSA] Somehow,
I managed to contain it.

337
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,791
[KNIGHT 13B]
Princess Carissa!

338
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,416
Don't worry. I'm fine.

339
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,583
This was an attack
from Coven Compass.

340
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,291
Recover the railway
car and reseal it.

341
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,333
[KNIGHT 13B]
Right!

342
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:35,375
[TATEMIYA] I'd say things
went quite well overall.

343
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,791
Curtana's power has
been dampened at last.

344
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,708
Now we just wait for
the countercoup forces

345
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,833
we called in to
start assembling.

346
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,875
Then we charge the palace.

347
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,541
Once we have control of Carissa,
the coup d'état will fall apart.

348
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,083
Almost done. Which means...

349
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,458
Which means what?

350
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,541
[TATEMIYA chuckles]

351
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,791
You can't take what's not yours!

352
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,125
Ugh! I can't believe
you ate my meatball!

353
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,583
I did not!

354
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,750
[AGNESE]
Light salad is not an option!

355
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:09,375
We still have to fight,
so don't eat too much!

356
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,250
[SISTER 13A] More food!
I demand you give me more,

357
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,791
no questions asked!

358
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,000
[TATEMIYA] You know what we
have to do before a big battle.

359
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:18,583
You and I must fortify
our bellies, of course!

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,333
[KANZAKI]
Aren't you going to eat?

361
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,750
I was, but everyone's
fierce determination

362
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,000
to stuff their
faces distracted me.

363
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,250
Oh, come on!
You need a break!

364
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,500
Let me take over for you!

365
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,208
Uh, no thanks.
It's really not a good time.

366
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,500
See, we just got done fighting
and I was sweating a lot,

367
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,375
so I'm afraid my
outfit might be smelly.

368
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,500
Then I've got the perfect
Cinderella mission

369
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,500
for you, Itsuwa!

370
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,458
[ITSUWA]
Huh?

371
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,625
[TATEMIYA]
Ta-da!

372
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,416
Looks like opening
night for the premier

373
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,833
of the Great Fairy
Revealing Maid outfit!

374
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,750
Tatemiya, why would
you bring that horrible

375
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,083
doomsday weapon here?

376
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,208
[TATEMIYA] And Priestess,
you'll be please to know

377
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:57,166
I also carefully saved your
precious bridal outfit.

378
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,083
I never asked you
to do that for me!

379
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
Why would I even
need that thing?

380
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,833
Oh, really?

381
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,375
Does that mean you
have something better,

382
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,458
like a hyper-fallen-angel
sexy maid outfit?

383
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,583
Wow, you go above
and beyond, don't you?

384
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:09,750
[KANZAKI]
I do not!

385
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,208
Sister Agnese.

386
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,333
The far east denomination
seems to be saying something

387
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,375
about not letting good
breasts go to waste.

388
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,375
I see. So who among our camp
would be the most effective

389
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:21,000
in serving as a
counterargument for this?

390
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,625
You can count me out for sure.

391
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,458
There's no way I'm doing
something like that!

392
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,666
I saw this and instantly
thought it would look lovely

393
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,208
on you, so I brought it here
along with that pedestal.

394
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:33,500
I never asked for either!
Don't you judge my goth outfits!

395
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,125
[ORSOLA]
Then you leave me no choice.

396
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,083
I will wear it so it
doesn't go to waste.

397
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,833
You idiot! Stop that at once!

398
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,000
[KNIGHT LEADER] It appears that
Curtana Original was overloaded.

399
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,291
Was that your doing?

400
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,500
Well, no.

401
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,750
But my guess would be
that it was the work

402
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,166
of magical specialists
within the country.

403
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,708
[KNIGHT LEADER]
I see.

404
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,041
And as a result, the knights
are on the verge of collapsing.

405
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,625
Is that so?

406
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,666
If it is, it can be set aside
with your return, can it not?

407
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,583
Are you having second thoughts?

408
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,708
[KNIGHT LEADER] I offer you a
warning before you leap into

409
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,750
the jaws of death.

410
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:08,416
In our fight earlier,
I could only control

411
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,416
one fighting pattern at a time.

412
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,500
As a result,
I was defeated by you.

413
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,083
Second Princess Carissa
and Curtana Original

414
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,375
are equipped with
each of these patterns.

415
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,833
She can produce an attack
that cannot be avoided,

416
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,416
blocked, or countered.

417
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,333
If you truly mean to bring
her down, be prepared.

418
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,208
[ISAHAYA]
Deputy Pope!

419
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:32,250
Coven Compass has arrived
at the designated coordinates!

420
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:36,541
Attention! The time
has come at last!

421
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,958
Ready to go?

422
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,125
You bet!

423
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,416
[RIMEA] Oh, dear, it appears
that we didn't make it in time.

424
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,666
[ELIZARD] I Can't believe
they left us behind.

425
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,416
And they made me run
into my calculating

426
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,666
oldest daughter whom
I had no desire to see.

427
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,958
How rude to call me calculating.

428
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,833
Why not refer to it
as an intelligent,

429
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,625
level-headed decision
made in the event

430
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:05,458
that Carissa slipped up
and released Curtana Original's

431
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,583
full power.

432
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,458
A matter of self-preservation?

433
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,291
That is what calculating means!

434
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:13,625
Keep going, horsie.

435
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,541
I've got important business
to take care of back in London.

436
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,208
So, have the arrangements
for that flag been made?

437
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,333
The one in the British Museum?

438
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:26,375
I would say we are about
halfway to completion on that.

439
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,750
Not many would recognize
it as a magical item

440
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:31,708
after being mixed in with
the other general artifacts.

441
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,125
Now if Charles Conder
from the museum does exactly

442
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:36,875
as we discussed,
and I fully expect him to,

443
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:40,083
then it should prove to be
quite useful to us, indeed.

444
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,250
[ELIZARD] My word, with the
fate of the United Kingdom

445
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,541
on the line, they're charging
into the final showdown

446
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,916
without so much as a plan--
just their pluck and their guts.

447
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,458
Bloody fools!

448
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,708
Well, well.

449
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,250
I must say, your tone
doesn't match the smile

450
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,750
on your face...

451
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:54,916
Dearest mother.

452
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,041
[KAMIJO] Are men powerless
in the face of overwhelming

453
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,458
military might?

454
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,291
No, they're not.

455
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,000
Everyone fights for the
United Kingdom tonight!

456
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,750
Next time, "Heroes."

457
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,625
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
