She was able to remove the virus

Her method for healing involved
having the patient listen

to a very specific song.

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,583
as soon as he was
done with them.

178
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,958
So I thought I could
show 'em a way outta here.

179
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,916
[SASHA]
Question one, if I may:

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,291
What payment plan?

181
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,666
Well, it wouldn't be with money.

182
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,541
If you will make a pledge
to help Britain out

183
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,750
the next time they find
themselves in a tight spot,

184
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:53,750
we could call things even.

185
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,750
This is my first answer:

186
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,416
Gather everyone who wishes
to leave the front lines

187
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,625
and take them away at once.

188
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,916
I have no intention of leaving
here... until I get back at Fia.

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,166
Heh, heh, heh!

190
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,916
Fine! As you wish!

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,208
Wait.

192
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,750
Were you saying you
wanna get back at Fiamma?

193
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,666
My second answer, if I may:

194
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,750
I am not obligated
to respond to you.

195
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:16,750
[LESSAR grunts]

196
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,875
[BOTH gasp]

197
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,666
The Star of Bethlehem
is among the heavens.

198
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,833
With the power of Gabriel,

199
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,166
I've manipulated
the celestial bodies.

200
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,083
Each of the four
elements have returned

201
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,041
to their proper positions.

202
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,500
The arrangements
have all been made.

203
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,750
So now, I think it's time
I claimed your right hand.

204
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:55,375
Then we can finally declare
Project Bethlehem complete.

205
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,375
Oh, can we?

206
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,041
That's how badly you want the
Roman Orthodox Church to win?

207
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,500
[FIAMMA] I couldn't care less
about that organization.

208
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,208
Everything I've done has
been for one reason.

209
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,875
And that one reason is me!

210
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,333
[KAMIJO]
Can I cancel him out?

211
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,375
No!

212
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,708
Oh!

213
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,416
I see you've learned not only
how to zero out an attack,

214
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,791
but also to fend it off.

215
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,458
[FIAMMA] Is that an Academy
City optical weapon?

216
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,583
[gasps]

217
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,041
As I've demonstrated before,

218
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,041
my right arm optimizes its
output to match the difficulty

219
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:50,250
of whatever trial I might
currently be facing.

220
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:53,750
So optical weapons, or anything
else they may have...

221
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,458
...are simply a waste of time.

222
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,458
They're no match for me.

223
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,041
This is ridiculous.

224
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,666
On the other hand,
you should be proud.

225
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,458
My fist appears
to be at somewhat

226
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,583
of an uncharacteristic
loss in that...

227
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,041
...it doesn't know how
hard to hit you.

228
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:20,166
Warning. Chapter
twenty-two, verse one.

229
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,875
Eli Eli Lama Sabachthani
is now activating.

230
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,125
It does seem to have
its disadvantages

231
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,458
as a straightforward spell.

232
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,541
[yells]

233
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,166
[FIAMMA]
Warning.

234
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,958
Chapter twenty-nine,
verse thirty-three

235
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,166
is currently activating.

236
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:54,208
[KAMIJO groaning]

237
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,708
[KAMIJO]
Damn it.

238
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,125
He's using Index's knowledge

239
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:02,000
and combining it with his
Right Seat of God skills.

240
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,791
Warning, this is chapter
thirty-five at verse eighteen.

241
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:11,000
"Brimstone Rain Shall Burn
the Earth" now activating.

242
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,083
[FIAMMA]
How terrible.

243
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,916
It strayed from its
theoretical value.

244
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,583
I think I'd feel bad
using it on any adversary

245
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,583
who was dragged out
into the open like this.

246
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,708
So I'm an adversary now?

247
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,208
Enlighten me.

248
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,625
What can I say?
This world is twisted.

249
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,750
It feels like it's aging,
in the same way that humans do--

250
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,833
breaking down and going mad.

251
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,250
And that's despite God
supposedly having arranged

252
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,541
all the gears so that
everything turns correctly.

253
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,458
[FIAMMA] How did things
become this bent out of shape?

254
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,208
The answer is simple.

255
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,833
It's because a number
of these gears

256
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,500
have already reached
their limits.

257
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,125
So I'm restoring them
to their original form.

258
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:13,791
[FIAMMA]
I'm altering the mechanisms,

259
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:17,875
exchanging the gears, and
eradicating the contamination.

260
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,333
Bathing the world in the ways
of the church of the cross

261
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,583
as it was intended,

262
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,375
and restoring it to its
former graceful motion.

263
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:25,958
[KAMIJO] So basically,
you're going to use magic

264
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:28,208
to alter other people's minds
however you see fit,

265
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,666
is that right?

266
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,916
It's much simpler than that.

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,708
I desire only to
teach them a lesson.

268
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,875
Look, all I have to do is wield
my perfect arm one time

269
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,291
and humanity will finally see

270
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,541
how tragically
outmatched they are.

271
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,458
That's when they'll realize:

272
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,666
The only thing required
of them is to obey,

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,875
and right before their
eyes, I, in turn,

274
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,916
will save every single
person in the world.

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,500
Just wait for that instant
when the Star of Bethlehem

276
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,125
lights up the night sky.

277
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,666
That's the moment when it will
become clear to everyone,

278
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,916
and we can all celebrate the new
age that has already begun!

279
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,333
[KAMIJO] You're gonna
save the world, huh?

280
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,916
The only way that makes sense
is if you just haven't had time

281
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,541
to get out and
look at the world.

282
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,041
Have you seen
their smiling faces?

283
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,416
What are you trying
to save them from?

284
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,875
Interesting view.

285
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,625
And I'll think on it.

286
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:24,791
But not now.

287
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,166
We'll have to catch
up at another time,

288
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,958
as I've got a world to save.

289
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:33,541
[KAMIJO screaming]

290
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:34,958
[FIAMMA chuckles]

291
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,416
Got it.

292
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,291
[laughing]

293
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,250
Imagine Breaker may have started
as a type of purification

294
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,000
that was naturally instilled
within the sacred right arm,

295
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,791
but as it takes on my power--
one of its original components--

296
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,125
that unnecessary function's
role comes to an end.

297
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,541
My right arm will
finally be complete.

298
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,625
The only thing left to do
is wield the full power

299
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,041
that rightfully
resides within me

300
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:13,333
and I will provide
salvation for all.

301
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,583
People may start referring
to me as Kamijo,

302
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,833
the "Person Superior to God,"
but I don't care.

303
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,291
As long as this power can
be used to save the world,

304
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,333
I will succeed.

305
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,125
[FIAMMA]
The time has come.

306
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,041
I will save the world.

307
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,791
Hey! Be grateful!

308
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,250
At least you had the opportunity

309
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,708
to do something good
with your life!

310
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,500
What? No.

311
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,375
[FIAMMA]
I've assimilated your right arm,

312
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,666
so how can it be possible
for you to deflect me

313
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,541
without any power?

314
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,333
[FIAMMA]
What is he doing?

315
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:33,625
Something's happening.
But it's invisible.

316
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,666
[KAMIJO]
That's it.

317
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,250
I don't know who
you think you are

318
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,083
or who you're supposed to be.

319
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:52,875
It's not a mystery
worth solving to me.

320
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,250
I couldn't care less about
what you're trying to do.

321
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,875
But...

322
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,750
...whatever it is, drop it!

323
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,083
I'll handle
everything from here!

324
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,750
What? No.

325
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,916
You renounced it--willingly
gave up that much power,

326
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,916
and reclaimed your
Imagine Breaker from me?

327
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,333
[KAMIJO] I'm finally starting
to understand some of this.

328
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,958
Oh? Do tell.

329
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:28,083
Why did you have to construct
the Star of Bethlehem

330
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,416
on such a large scale?

331
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,250
If you, Fiamma of the Right,
really were some almighty being,

332
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,166
you wouldn't have had to
scrounge up different parts

333
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,041
from churches and cathedrals
around the world,

334
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,666
now would you?

335
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,958
Why go to so much trouble
to cause World War Three?

336
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,041
Your power changes to
match the difficulty level

337
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,583
of your opponent.

338
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,458
And because of that, the amount
of power you're able to use

339
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,583
is completely dependent on
someone else's strength.

340
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,541
But what could you
possibly want to achieve

341
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,500
that requires that much power?

342
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:00,458
Were you so desperate
that you had no choice

343
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,208
but to team up with other sects?

344
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,916
And if you're so invincible,

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,916
why would you ever need to
have people working for you?

346
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,125
Admit it. You were
terrified, weren't you?

347
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
Because the truth of the
matter is that you actually

348
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,500
don't know if you'll ever really
have enough power in you

349
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,291
to save the world.

350
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,666
The world has never
come to an end before.

351
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,000
And unfortunately for you,

352
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,125
I haven't heard anything
about it falling apart

353
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,750
in modern times.

354
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,791
Unfortunate because...
that's why you can never tell

355
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:37,791
if you have enough power
to save the world or not.

356
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
It's like my Imagine Breaker.

357
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,250
There's no way to
know what it can do

358
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,083
unless I'm surrounded by
espers and sorcerers, right?

359
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:49,041
So then... if you've never
been put in the position

360
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,708
to save the world,
you can't accurately claim

361
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,875
to have the power
that's required to do it.

362
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,250
And that's the real reason you
had to take things this far!

363
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,958
[FIAMMA]
So what if I did?

364
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:11,375
What right does someone like
you have to condemn me for it?

365
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,458
Or are you trying to tell me
that you've experienced

366
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,541
the kind of power it takes
to save the world?

367
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,500
Of course I have!

368
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,833
And yeah,

369
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,833
it may have been something
seemingly unimportant...

370
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,833
...but I have saved others.

371
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,083
Even when doing the
smallest of tasks,

372
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,333
I've witnessed the moment

373
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:31,291
when a single individual's
"world" was saved.

374
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,000
Someone who thinks they
can save the entire world

375
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,125
will only destroy it.

376
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:44,041
Our world isn't as
fragile as you think.

377
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,208
It doesn't need to be
saved by some bastard!

378
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,541
[chuckles]

379
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,791
[MIKOTO sighs]

380
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:00,125
Well, it looks like that's it.

381
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,291
Luckily, tanks are a lot
faster than I expected.

382
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:07,291
"Seeing you singlehandedly
run over them,

383
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,583
Misaka can't keep from
feeling inferior,"

384
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:13,291
Misaka says, as she
looks at you dejectedly.

385
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,708
What are you talking about?

386
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,541
All of you put together
could destroy me!

387
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,041
"You are referring, of course,

388
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,458
to our collective strength
while individuality is something

389
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,791
Misaka would desperately
like to have.

390
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,416
You could not possibly
understand how that feels,"

391
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,708
says Misaka, mumbling
bitterly under her breath.

392
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,791
Anyway, if I'm right,
you do have some knowledge

393
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,291
on how to operate the weapons
installed here, don't you?

394
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,458
[MISAKA 10777]
If needed,

395
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:35,750
it is possible to access
extra information

396
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,541
from the Misaka Network.

397
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,000
[MIKOTO] I'm not sure
if they were using this

398
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,708
for aerial combat or
transportation or what,

399
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,166
but there's a VTOL fighter
over there, right?

400
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,041
I bet we could use that.

401
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,291
If so, we can fly right up
to that fortress in the sky,

402
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:54,750
can't we?

403
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,916
[KAMIJO]
People don't just have malice,

404
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,833
they have benevolence, too.

405
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,833
They fight, pray, and stand up
for those they wish to protect.

406
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,750
And they don't need
any other reason.

407
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,375
Next time, "Wings."

408
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:10,750
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
