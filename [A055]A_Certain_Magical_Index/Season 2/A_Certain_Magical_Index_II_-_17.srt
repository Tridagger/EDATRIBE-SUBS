342
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,750
See? Simple, isn't it?

343
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,958
It's amazing.
And you know...

344
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,583
I almost feel
like I'm in a dream.

345
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,833
You're a great teacher!

346
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:22,625
Ah! Uh!

347
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,750
[MIKOTO] What's the matter?

348
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,916
[trembling]

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,666
[KUROKO] Uiharu!

350
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,625
[screams]

351
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,291
[KUROKO] What do you think
you're doing? We've got work!

352
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,708
Hey, I know
I'm late. Sorry!

353
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,833
[MIKOTO] Sorry, huh?
If this is how you make good

354
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,291
on all your bets, you're
a dirty, welshing rat!

355
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,416
Do you really think I don't
have anything better to do

356
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
than wait here for over an hour?

357
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,125
Well, no. I didn't
mean to be late.

358
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
I got caught up--Wait, an hour?

359
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,083
But I'm pretty sure we agreed
on one o'clock, didn't we?

360
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,875
Hang on, did you show up thirty
minutes early or something?

361
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,541
[KAMIJO] Wow, you have
been here a long time.

362
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:01,083
I, uh. I was in the
area anyway, so I figured

363
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,208
I would just wait here
until you showed up.

364
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,083
In the area. I see.

365
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,791
Well, I was, uh, shopping.

366
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,500
You're so eager to see
me suffer you showed up

367
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,833
thirty minutes early.

368
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,333
Huh?

369
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,708
[KAMIJO] You really get off
on other people's pain, huh?

370
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,208
[grunts]

371
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,750
You almost got me.

372
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,000
Stop complaining so much!

373
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,958
You lost a bet,
now it's time to pay.

374
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,000
You agreed to
do whatever I said!

375
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,541
Yeah. About that.

376
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,458
Could we be more
specific about "whatever"?

377
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:31,125
You will do what I say.

378
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,208
[MIKOTO] Now, come with me!

379
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,541
[KAMIJO] Where are we going?

380
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,083
[MIKOTO] Just come along
and do it without talking.

381
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,666
That's the first penalty!

382
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,458
[KAMIJO] The first? You
mean there's more than one?

383
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,958
[KAMIJO] The Handy
Antenna service?

384
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,166
Ah. I see where this is going.

385
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,041
You're looking to replace
the antenna base on your cell.

386
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,125
Yep. Subscribers
can use them to create

387
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,958
their own networks
and everything.

388
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,875
[MIKOTO] Also, if you
sign a couples' contract,

389
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,000
the rate is
substantially cheaper.

390
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,333
A couples' contract?

391
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,750
Yeah but wait there's
more, everybody who signs

392
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,958
a contract right now will get

393
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,166
a Lovely Mitten
Gekota strap for free!

394
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,000
Huh?

395
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,125
That's where you come in.

396
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,000
We're going to
sign up today.

397
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,708
[sighs] All you really want
out of this is the strap.

398
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,125
Don't you have enough
cartoon frog stuff already?

399
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,166
Uh!

400
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,625
You are signing
up with me today.

401
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,958
Yeah, okay. But isn't
a couples' contract

402
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,875
usually something that
a boyfriend and girlfriend

403
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,166
would sign up for.

404
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,000
What? Oh, please!
You're jumping to conclusions!

405
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,375
It has to be
a boy and a girl.

406
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:30,041
But I don't think that
means you actually

407
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,875
have to be going
out or anything.

408
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,500
For example, I'm sure they'd
sign up a married couple.

409
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,000
Marriage, now?

410
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:38,458
I think this relationship
is moving too quickly for me.

411
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,833
You--You shut up! I'm
in charge and we've got

412
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,791
a contract to sign! C'mon.

413
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,375
Ah...

414
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,750
Okay! That's about it.

415
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,166
We just need a photograph
to complete the paperwork.

416
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,833
Oh, you mean
like a picture ID?

417
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,375
[FEMALE CLERK 17A]
No, something that proves to us

418
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:53,791
that you really are a couple.

419
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,666
It doesn't have
to be anything fancy.

420
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,625
You can use your
cell if you want to.

421
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,625
Wait, together?

422
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,791
[KAMIJO] So, uh. Want to
use the camera on my phone?

423
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,916
[MIKOTO] Sure, that'll work.

424
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,333
Okay, then, here we go.

425
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,708
Just so we're absolutely
clear about this,

426
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,000
you're the one who wants
this contract so badly.

427
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:16,791
I am. I know that, thank you.

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,875
I'll do this for you, Gekota!

429
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,208
Well, here we go.

430
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,583
[MIKOTO] Let's do it.
Whenever you're ready.

431
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,708
[phone beeps]

432
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,458
[KAMIJO] It looks like
you're just joking around.

433
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,291
[MIKOTO] What about you?
Looking the other way.

434
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,583
Probably not what
a couple looks like.

435
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,166
Yeah, you're right.
Let's try it again.

436
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,875
[phone beeps]

437
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
[KAMIJO] You're making the exact
same face that you made before!

438
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,666
Please! You look
like you'd rather be

439
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,500
poking your eyes
out with a fork!

440
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,208
This is only gonna work
if we can get a photo

441
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,541
of us that makes it
look like we're in love!

442
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,208
Proximity should help.

443
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,041
[KAMIJO] Now, just smile!
This is only a picture

444
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:56,416
for some paperwork, right?

445
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,875
As long as we think
about it that way,

446
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,250
it shouldn't be a problem.

447
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,333
Right. You're right.
We can totally pull this off.

448
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,541
[MIKOTO]
It just has to look like

449
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,958
we have feelings for each other.

450
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,750
It isn't like it's
real or anything!

451
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:07,666
[KAMIJO] Say cheese!

452
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,666
[MIKOTO] Cheese!

453
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,125
[phone beeps]

454
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,583
[KUROKO] Haaa!

455
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,375
It's my fault. I have no
one to blame but myself.

456
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,458
I underestimated
this talking baboon

457
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,375
and now here you are,
traipsing around town

458
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,208
and taking dirty
photographs with him.

459
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,000
No! You've got the
wrong idea about this!

460
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,250
I'm only using him to get a
Gekota phone accessory, okay?

461
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,375
And we had to take a photo
pretending to be a couple.

462
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,750
[KUROKO screams]

463
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,916
What are you thinking?

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,416
If you needed to
be part of a couple,

465
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,333
I should have been the very
first person you contacted!

466
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,625
I'm much better suited
for the job than him.

467
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,375
[MIKOTO] Wait! Stop it!

468
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,916
[KUROKO] Let's go
take some pictures!

469
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,208
They'll look a lot better than
anything you two could get.

470
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,708
[MIKOTO] Hey,
where are you taking me?

471
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,208
The shop is back there!

472
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:50,666
[KAMIJO] Looks
like you've got a plan.

473
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,750
Does this mean that
I get to go home now?

474
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,916
[MIKOTO] Like I told you,
it has to be a boy and a girl!

475
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,083
[FEMALE INTERVIEWER]
I'm here with Hajime Hitotsui.

476
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,375
Now, Hajime, I know
you're busy with concerts,

477
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,500
as usual, but the
word on the street is

478
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,750
that you'll be appearing
in a movie soon, as well.

479
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,125
[ACCELERATOR]
Must've fallen asleep.

480
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,791
I can only imagine
how excited you must be!

481
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,291
Would you like to tell
us a little bit about...

482
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,208
[ACCELERATOR] Tch. You're
letting yourself get sloppy.

483
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,958
Even with this thing on,
you're lucky if you can

484
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,166
fight for a full fifteen
minutes these days.

485
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,750
[HITOTSUI]
...process was new to me.

486
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,791
I was truly lucky to be working
with such a talented director.

487
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,375
And not only was he
talented, but patient, too!

488
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,041
[HITOTSUI] He really
helped me adjust.

489
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,708
That goes for the production
crew and my fellow

490
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,208
cast members, as well.

491
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,000
The spirit of camaraderie
on set was incredible.

492
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:32,916
I don't know exactly
what I was expecting

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,583
going into it,
but I ended up having

494
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,291
a pretty amazing experience.

495
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,375
If all films are like this
one...

496
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,791
Doesn't look like
anyone's around.

497
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,125
[HITOTSUI] I hope to be doing
many more in the future.

498
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,666
All right. I'll
grab a shower, then.

499
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,333
[GRILS gasp]

500
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,875
"Hey! What are you thinking,

501
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,208
barging in like that
without bothering to knock?"

502
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,208
Misaka Misaka yells,
reaching for a towel

503
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,208
attempting to
preserve her modesty.

504
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,958
There's a lock on
the door for a reason.

505
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,375
Yeah, sorry about that.
I'm used to living on my own,

506
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,000
so I don't usually
lock the door.

507
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,208
You might want to go ahead
and cover yourself up, too.

508
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,750
"You don't seem
to mind very much that

509

a boy just saw you naked,"

observing your
attitudes with confusion.

Hm. I don't really
see what there is

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,375
to make a big deal about.

Nudity is natural.

says Misaka Misaka,
completing the incident report.

00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,833
"If it is a formal
incident report,

523
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,333
that means it has already
gone out over the network,

524
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,125
so there appears
to be no clear purpose

525
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,416
for repeating it
verbally," says Misaka,

526
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
stating what she
thinks is obvious.

527
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,541
"Venting isn't as effective
unless it's done verbally,"

528
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,541
replies Misaka Misaka,
literally shaking with rage.

00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,541
"I see, and getting

not seem to have

"If Misaka had not
happened by, you might have

534
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,208
observes Misaka seriously,

535
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,916

laughing on the inside.

Hey. Where did the

[BOTH] Hm?

542
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,000
That's a good question.

[MISAKA 10032] "Are you talking
about these?" asks Misaka,

as the question

"All of the other
Misakas have those

the only one without a pair,"

00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,666
says Misaka Misaka, looking
enviously at your headgear.

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,583
"Those Misakas
are those Misakas,

says Misaka, hoping you'll
give up without arguing.

"No fair! Misaka really,
really, really wants

wheedles Misaka Misaka,
