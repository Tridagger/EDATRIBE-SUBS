00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,958
[STIYL] Please, Archbishop!

2
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,666
I have asked before.
Call me not by that name.

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,958
[LAURA] It does not suit.

4
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,500
Fine but, shouldn't you
have more guards with you?

5
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:45,833
If you want to talk to me,

6
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:49,000
can't we do it at
St. George's Cathedral?

7
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,791
[LAURA] No, I think not.
I have no desire to be

8
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,125
confined within
that dusty old minster.

9
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:57,125
We can talk whilst
we take in the air.

10
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,166
[STIYL] Well... I suppose
that will have to do.

11
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,708
Are you always such
a dour fellow, Stiyl?

12
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,916
Why should a brief
constitutional on a pleasant

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,583
afternoon unsettle
you to such a degree?

14
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,250
If it's alright, Laura Stuart,

15
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:11,250
maybe I could
ask you a question?

16
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,333
No need to be so
formal. What is it?

17
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,083
Fine, then. Is
there any reason you

18
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,333
speak in such a
ridiculously archaic way?

19
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:23,708
Oh, I... Well...
Is it truly strange?

20
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,583
I even checked with
a local to be certain

21
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:27,125
my speech was acceptable!

22
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:29,958
Who exactly was this
local you spoke with?

23
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,958
'Twas a gentleman named
Motoharu Tsuchimikado.

24
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,625
That guy is
neither a gentleman

25
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,875
nor a good example
of a "local."

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,333
A communications
talisman?

27
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,708
[LAURA] It should help.

28
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,625
Now, what do you know
about "The Book of the Law"?

29
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,416
[STIYL] For starters,
it's a grimoire, and if I

30
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,458
remember right, it was
written by Edward Alexander.

31
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,166
The original text
is currently said

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,458
to be held in Vatican Library.

33
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:04,000
However, it is believed
that no one can decipher it.

34
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,625
[LAURA] Not even the
Index Librorum Prohibitorum,

35
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,708
who has memorized
so many others.

36
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,750
[LAURA] But what if somebody
who could decipher

37
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,500
"The Book of the
Law" came forward?

38
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,083
Please tell me you're kidding!

39
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,375
[crowd gasps]

40
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,083
Shh!

41
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,166
[LAURA] The person who
can decipher the grimoire is

42
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,791
a Roman Catholic sister by
the name of Orsola Aquinas.

43
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,666
[STIYL] Are you saying
"The Book of the Law" has

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,541
become an instrument
in the power struggle?

45
00:02:28,625 --> 00:02:32,500
[LAURA] Thankfully, no.
For the time being, at least.

46
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,208
[LAURA] "The Book of the Law"
and Orsola Aquinas

47
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,375
have both reportedly
been spirited away.

48
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,666
[LAURA] Shall we
go inside to discuss

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,791
the matter in greater detail?

I don't care how many

Toma never plays with me

I'm sure there are
reasons he doesn't have

00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,666
as much time to spend
with you as you want.

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,500
It's not like he goes
to school and does homework

63
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,958
because that's what
he enjoys doing.

or doing homework!

66
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,166
Hm. The vocational
training I chose makes me

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,125
an exception to the rule.
The fundamentals of

68
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:01,166
[MAIKA] a maid's studies
are practical, after all.

69
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,541
Hey, I know! I'll
become a maid, too!

00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,125

visit Toma at school

cute maid's uniform.

72
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,291
Becoming a maid isn't
something to take lightly!

73
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,250
It's too difficult a
profession for a girl

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,583
with zero
housekeeping skills.

75
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,625
Okay, then Toma
can become a maid.

00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:24,458
Then he'll have time to visit
me in his maid's uniform!

77

If I were you, I
would avoid mentioning

particular idea to him.

A sporting competition

87

The main purpose of the

more interaction between
espers on a larger scale.

89
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,250
It's the one day of the

[KAMIJO] Due to
unfortunate circumstances,

I had my memory
wiped out a while ago.

wiped out, in fact,

that I don't even remember
an event as big as this one.

Huh?

00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,583
Are you listening to me?
I'm talking abduction!

103
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,458
A guy just showed
up and took her away?

104
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,041
Yeah, and then the
kidnapper gave me this

105
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,750
to give you upon your return.

106
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:10,166
"Dear Toma Kamijo.
If you value her life,

[KAMIJO] Alright. Can you tell
me what this creep looked like?

112
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,583
[MAIKA] Uh. Well, first
of all, he was tall.

113
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,666
Like, taller than five-ten.
His hair was deep red,

114
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,666
and of all things, he had a
barcode under his right eye.

115
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,791
[MAIKA] There was a
cigarette in his mouth

116
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,625
and lots of
piercings in his ears.

117
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,291
Oh, then there's
nothing to worry about.

118
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,875
This particular
kidnapper is someone

119
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,666
Index and I already know.

120
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,083
[MAIKA] You know the kidnapper?

121
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,333
Oh, I see. Is it a
case of love gone wrong?

122
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:46,208
Uh... no. It's, uh, it's
complicated, that's all.

123
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,166
[BOTH] Hm?

124
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,750
An exit pass.
Well, that's helpful.

125
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,500
[STIYL] That about sums up the
situation. You get all of that?

126
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,916
Mmm. "The Book of the Law"

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,041
has been stolen
from the Vatican.

128
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,083
[INDEX] The only person
who can decipher it,

129
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:07,708
a nun named Orsola Aquinas,
has disappeared too.

130
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,208
And it seems that the
Amakusa Church is responsible.

131
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:17,541
[STIYL] Vatican security is no
joke. How did they get it out?

132
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:20,125
It happened in transit while
the Roman Orthodox Church

133
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,125
was relocating "The
Book of the Law" to Japan.

134
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:24,916
Are they complete morons?

dangerous as that! And, what?

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,416
Now the Catholics are looking
to the English Puritan Church

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,000
for assistance with
their own stupid blunder?

138
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:37,000
[LAURA] Not so. Something has
actually come up on our end.

139
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,458
[STIYL] And that is?

140
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,208
We're currently unable
to reach Kaori Kanzaki.

141
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,583

head of the Amakusa Church.

If she finds out that
the Amakusa are at odds

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,583
with the Roman
Orthodox Church...

144
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,166
Let's just say
I do not want her

145
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,125
to interfere in this matter.

146

[LAURA] Use any methods
you deem necessary.

147
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,958
Kanzaki is a saint--
one of fewer than

148
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,916
twenty in the world.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,791
Are you saying that you
expect me to fight her?

150
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,458
[LAURA] If the
situation calls for it.

151
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,750
There is much work to do.

152
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,125
Go and get in touch
with Academy City.

153
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:23,125
Oh, and Stiyl... I would
like for you to take this.

154
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,333
Hm.

155
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:28,666
And this is...?

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,541
I suppose you could
call it a modest gift from

157
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,833
the English Puritan
Church to Orsola. Now...

It would be good to have a
specialist, don't you think?

160
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,791
I don't get why you're
dragging Toma into this.

161
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,250
Yeah, me either.
It's not exactly like

163
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,166

at least tell me why

164
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,666
we're going to the
Amakusa's headquarters?

165
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,375
[STIYL] Actually,
the situation's changed.

166
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,708

[KAMIJO] He had
to pick this spot?

00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,958
Outside of Academy City, I
don't know where anything is.

172
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,666
[sigh]

173
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,541
That looks like a nun.

174
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,833
[KAMIJO] I wonder if there's
any chance this sister

175
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,708
is a friend of Index's.

176
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,291
[WOMAN] Pardon me.

177
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,708
What? But of course.

178
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,750
[WOMAN] I wonder
if you could help me.

179
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,250
Is this the bus
I should be taking

180
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,083
if I'm going to Academy City?

181
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,000
[KAMIJO] Academy City, huh?

182
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:48,166
Sorry, but no bus is
going to take you there.

183
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,708
Really?

184
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,208
All modes of transportation
into the city, including buses,

185
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,000
have been discontinued.
But there is a pedestrian gate

186
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,583
[KAMIJO] right over
there that you can use. Uh.

187
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,125
[WOMAN] Thank you for
taking the time to assist me.

188
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,666
I do appreciate it.

189
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,583
[KAMIJO] I just said
not to get on the bus!

190
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:09,625
[WOMAN] Oh, right,
so you did. Thank you.

191
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,333
Like I told you,
you have to walk through

192
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,041
that gate over there.
You got it now?

193
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,333
[WOMAN] Please forgive me.

194
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,750
I am very sorry
to have bothered you.

195
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:20,041
Yeah. Uh... eh?

196
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,500
[KAMIJO] Hey, nun!

197
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,958
Were you just smiling and
pretending to listen to me?

198
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,000
[sighs]

199
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,291
It looks as if
something has upset you.

200
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,750
May I help in any way?

201
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,833
Oh, it's nothing.

202
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,541
Pardon the familiarity

203
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,541
and I hope you'll forgive
me for saying so,

204
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,291
but you're
sweating quite a lot.

205
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,833
Thank you. I'm fine!

206
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:48,000
But, uh, just out of curiosity,

207
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,208
why are you going
to Academy City?

208
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,833
[WOMAN] Ah... Oh, well...
it's a rather long story.

209
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,500
There are some people
chasing me, you see.

210
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,166
Why would they do that?

211
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,708
[GIRL It's all
a mess! All of it!

212
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,750
We can't even be sure of
our intelligence right now.

213
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,125
[GIRL] We don't know if
"The Book of the Law" is secure.

214
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,625
I'm sorry, I should
give you my name.

215
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,500
Agnese Sanctis. A sister of
the Roman Orthodox Church.

216
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,791
A pleasure. So,
can you update us

217
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:23,291
on the situation
with the Amakusa?

218
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,500
Sorry, no. You've
hit upon yet another gap

219
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,375
in the information
that we have available.

220
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,000
[INDEX] The Amakusa Church
is known for their secrecy.

221
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,000
Their distinctive feature
is that they don't use

222
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,541
incantations or magical arrays.
All of their rituals and

223
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:40,791
processes are concealed
within normal behaviors.

224
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,291
[INDEX] So even the most
discerning magician would have

225
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:46,250
a difficult time
identifying who they are.

226
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,750
Uh-huh. They're definitely
an annoying group.

227
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,875
Yay! It's Toma!

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,041
[AGNESE] With Orsola Aquinas?

229
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,208
[KAMIJO]
What were you thinking?

230
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,791
Was there a reason for
pretending to kidnap her?

231
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,625
Oh, my. Have I upset
you? Here's the thing.

232
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,500
We needed to find
somebody who was missing,

233
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,541
and we thought you might
be able to help us out.

234
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,750
Find someone?

235
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,666
[STIYL] Don't worry
about it now, though.

236
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,625
If you'll just hand over
the sister you've got there,

237
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,583
we can call it a done deal.

238
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,750
Wha--?

239
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,708
Hand over the nun.
You see, as it happens,

240
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,916
[STIYL] the woman
accompanying you

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,791
is our missing person, Orsola.

242
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,625
So, yeah. Good
work and all that.

243
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,500
We're done here.
You're free to go.

244
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,666
Wha--Uh...

245
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,958
So, um... Do I get
some kind of reward for

246
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,875
dragging myself all the
way down here in the hot sun?

247
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:44,458
[STIYL] I already told you
you did a good job, right?

248
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,708
So, what? You want me to
buy you a snow cone now, too?

249
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,125
[KAMIJO]
I've had enough of this.

250
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,500
I've done my best to at
least try and keep the peace,

251
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,208
despite the fact that we
rub each other the wrong way.

252
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,166
But this is it!
I'm done playing nice!

253
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,500
Uh...

254
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:02,333
Wow. What an incredibly
pathetic cry for attention.

255
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:04,166
Sorry, but I can't
do anything about your

256
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,125
lonely little life. Even
if I cared enough to try.

257
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,458
Now, please release
Orsola into our custody.

258
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,958
You did say that
someone was chasing you;

259
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:14,666
maybe it's
not a bad idea.

260
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,208
You're shaking. Is
something the matter?

261
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,458
[MALE VOICE] Hate to interrupt.
But I really can't allow you

262
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,208
to hand the sister
over to these people.

263
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,250
That's right, Orsola Aquinas.

264
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,000
You will not be returning
to the bosom of

265
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:29,208
the Roman Orthodox Church, but
coming with me to live a more

266
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,375
meaningful and productive
life among the Amakusa.

267
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,958
Amakusa's here?

268
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,833
[KAMIJO] Orsola!

269
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,833
[INDEX] No, you
can't go after her!

270
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,125
In my hand, I hold the fire.

271
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,583
Its form is that of a
sword, and its purpose is to--

272
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,750
[STIYL] Looks like I'm
too late for that to work.

273
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,958
Alright, out with it!

274
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,458
Explain to me what's
going on here. Everything!

275
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,291
[STIYL] An explanation?

276
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:07,000
That's something
I wish I had right now.

277
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,833
[INDEX] "The Book of the Law."
It's a grimoire written in a

278
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,500
code that supposedly no
one in the world can break.

279
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,541
It's said that if
it ever was deciphered,

280
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,000
the person who managed it would
be granted absolute power.

281
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,125
[KAMIJO] You're kidding,
right? I mean, after all,

282
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,833
it's just a book.
How powerful can it be?

283
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,458
[STIYL] Something
else is said about it.

284
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,583
If the book is decoded,
it will also mean

285
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,083
the end of the Church of
the Cross' religious rule.

286
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,375
So why not just
burn the thing then?

287
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,750
Grimoires aren't normal
books so they don't burn.

288
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:43,041
Just to seal them requires
an immense amount of power.

289
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:49,500
[AGNESE breathing heavy]

290
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,791
Oh, uh. I'm sorry.
I wanted to explain

291
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,875
our analysis of
the situation. If you--

292
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,708
[screaming]

293
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,291
Uh-ahhh!

294
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,875
Be careful!

295
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,666
[thud]

296
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,958
Ugh. Uh...

297
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,791
Uh.

298
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:12,041
Uh. Uh...

299
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,125
Uh.

300
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,583
[screams]

301
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,125
Hey, stop it!
What are you doing?

302
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,625
Get away! This is wrong!

303
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,416
[INDEX] Toma! I don't think
she needs your help anymore.

304
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,250
Maybe you should get up!

305
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,500
Quit screwing around.
We have things to do.

306
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,041
[KAMIJO] Uh...!

307
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,875
[AGNESE] What we know for
certain right now is this.

308
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,958
Orsola Aquinas is in
the hands of the Amakusa.

309
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:35,708
According to our latest
estimation, the number of

310
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,791
Amakusa Church members involved
in this is less than fifty.

311
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,208
There is also
the possibility that

312
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,875
they are no longer underground.

313
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,791
So basically, what you're
trying to say is that

314
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,333
we don't know very much?

315
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,375
All we have to work
with are magical traces

316
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,958
and what we know of
the group's tendencies.

317
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,916
[INDEX] The Amakusa specialize
in hiding and fleeing.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,083
It's what they do. It won't
be easy to catch them.

319
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,208
That's true, but I
think even they will have

320
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,125
a difficult time
breaking out of our net.

321
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,000
Do you know their
transfer technique?

322
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,583
[INDEX]
"Microcosmic Pilgrimage."

323
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,625
[INDEX] It's a process they can
only use inside this country.

324
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,875
Essentially, there are
forty-seven specialized vortices

325
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,833
across Japan and the
Amakusa practitioners can

326
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,125
freely come and
go between them.

327
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,041
If they manage to send
her through a vortex,

328
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,333
it's all over.

329
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,416
[AGNESE] So why are
we sitting around here?

330
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,583
Because at the moment,
there's no reason to hurry.

331
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,166
[AGNESE] Huh?

332
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,208
[INDEX] Microcosmic Pilgrimages
are reliant upon the movement

333
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,333
of the stars. Which
means that there are only

334
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,833
certain times the Amakusa
can use the vortices.

335
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,708
The transport they
likely have planned for Orsola

336
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,291
won't be available to them
until just after midnight,

337
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:42,291
so that gives us about four
and a half hours to work with.

338
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,541
One more thing.

339
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,875
Toma, may I borrow
