she doesn't seem

to know that herself.

kid wearing a nun's habit

175

show up there yet?

176
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,083
Yes, she did.
Would you care to explain

177
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,916

your proxy calculator?

planning to take this?

home, unharmed.

[FROG DOCTOR] You'll never
succeed. I mean it.

Stop and think this
through for a moment.

You've got too many objectives
for one person to achieve.

There's simply no way
you can do it all.

Don't tell me what
I can and can't handle.

--I know what kind of hell

00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,458
Which is why I have
no problem saying this.

194

Don't take on too much.
If you do, you're only

195

yourself up for more failure.

As long as she's still alive,
I'll be able to heal her,

do your part, I can't do mine.

Then I'd recommend sitting
still and being quiet.

[ACCELERATOR] There, a

Now I just need to
wash away my scent

We're getting

The only question
now is how many.

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,416
That is unfortunate.
What do you think could have

239
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,708
possibly kept her out
so late this evening?

240
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,166
Ah! Wait, I might
have an idea.

241
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,666
It's possible that she has
a date with a troglodyte.

242
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,708
This is absolutely awful!

advantage of the evening rain

soon, I'll be forced to act.

won't work with you.

exactly know how

yourself right now?

342
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,250
That's enough!

343
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,833
Heh, heh.

344
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,125
Getting all wound up about it
isn't going to do you any good.

345
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,958
You're aware of everything going
on in Academy City, aren't you?

346
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,541
[VENTO] You have no
idea how valuable you are.

347
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,083
My top priority here
is to kill you.

348
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,875
Everything else is
just icing on the cake.

349
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:08,500
Even the List of
Prohibited Books is

350
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,666
of secondary importance.
There is no doubt you're

351
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,625
an enemy of the
Roman Orthodox Church.

352
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:17,583
And we use whatever means
necessary to defeat our enemies.

353
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,333
That includes wiping
out your city.

354
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,583
Or your entire country, for
that matter. Here, take a look.

355
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,291
As you can see, it was
signed by the pope himself.

356
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,708
What are you talking about?

357
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,833
[VENTO] I'm gonna have to
spell it out for you, huh?

358
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:31,291
All right, then. Maybe it'll
become clearer to you

359
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,166
once I kill every
person in here.

360
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,166
Don't do it!

361
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,791
And, away we go!

[UIHARU] Dinner's here, Shirai!
I didn't know what you wanted,

376
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,208
so I got a couple options.

377
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,791
[KUROKO] It should be me!
That dirty, rotten troglodyte

378
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:40,500
is out there right now, enjoying
the evening with my Sissy.

379
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,833
Oh! I almost forgot! It's
time for "Sudden Variety."

380
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,208
What channel is it on, again?

381
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,583
[KUROKO] Who cares?!

382
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,708
We've just received word of
a disturbance created by

383
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,875
an intruder here
in Academy City.

384
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,791
It is not yet clear if
there is a connection,

385
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,250
but we have also
received reports of

386
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,416
widespread damage in the area.

387
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,750
Ah! We now have footage.

388
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,500
Have we gotten any
reports tonight that might

389
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,458
correspond to the
video we just saw?

390
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,916
If one person was able
to completely overpower

391
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,708
Antiskill single handedly.
That tells us something about

392
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:13,166
how dangerous this
intruder must be.

393
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,750
[KUROKO] If it does
get out of hand,

394
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,541
I'm sure Antiskill will request
that we come and back them up.

395
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,458
But until then, let's get as
much paperwork done as possible.

396
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,416
Huh? Uiharu?

Heh. Just in time!
I won't die after all!

403
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,333
[ROD] You'd better play
nice with Hound Dog,

404
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,291
or you can say goodbye
to that little girl!

You don't have to--

Aahhh!

00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,750
You! Step away from him
and put your hands up!

Things are looking
worse by the minute.

413

So that's it, huh? This is how
the Roman Orthodox Church

414
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,833
[TSUCHIMIKADO] is planning
to bring down Academy City?

everybody and then
