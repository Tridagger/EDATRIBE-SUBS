516
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,625
[WOMAN] And I'm not entirely
satisfied with your tone.

517
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,625
That level of insubordination
borders on blasphemy.

518
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:50,708
Do you know to whom
you are speaking?

519
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,291
Sure old man;
you're the Pope.

520
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,333
And do you know how much I care?

521
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:56,125
Make one move to
threaten me and it'll be

522
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,708
the last thing
you'll ever do.

523
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,416
The Right Seat of God.

524
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,583
You people don't
respect anybody, do you?

525
00:25:03,666 --> 00:25:05,625
[WOMAN] I'm just gonna need
you to look this over real quick

526
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:06,958
and then sign it.

527
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,583
[POPE] Should I
assume that's an order?

528
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:11,666
[gasps] Hold on!
This document says...

529
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,958
Oh, it's nothing you weren't
thinking of ordering yourself

530
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,250
when the time
was right. [chuckles]

531
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:20,708
Hmm...

532
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,458
[KAMIJO] Academy City
calmly enters in to autumn.

533
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,041
Everything seems peaceful, but
I still have a promise to keep.

534
00:25:33,125 --> 00:25:35,125
What have I gotten myself into?

535
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,000
Next time, "Penalty Game."

536
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:40,250
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
