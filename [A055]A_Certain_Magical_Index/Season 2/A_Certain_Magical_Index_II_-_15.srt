What are you two doing on

Oh, well. We just happened to
end up on this ship by chance.

[ORSOLA] You said the
"Queen of the Adriatic Sea."

00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,416
Is that the name
given to this fleet of

extraordinary ice ships?

8
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:00,250
No, it is called
the Queen's Fleet,

00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,958
and the ship we're on is
one of the escort vessels.

So, do you feel like telling
us what you're doing here?

Searching for intruders,
as I was instructed to.

And what do you know?

15
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,333
I found some very
interesting intruders, indeed.

work this to my advantage.

We aren't involved with

If you're going to
keep yammering like that,

I'll be forced
to sound the alarm.

20
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,375
I would advise staying
on my good side if you

you have for letting us escape?

Well, it's a patrol fleet.

It was built to keep

In return for

They will take steps to keep
them from breaking out again.

69

And that most likely
means they'll be processed

70
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,375
so they can no longer
use their spell.

I want you to get them away
from here before that happens.

That is the price
for my silence,

and if you reach them in time,
you can use their escape spell.

Do you think
that will work?

00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,166
If the spell has already
been used before,

81
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,875
won't the guards

worry about you.

Additionally, I'll
head to the flag ship

[AGNESE] What the overseers
here are most worried about

I'm something of a

that possibility.
And that comes with perks.

96
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,833
[AGNESE] For example, I have
the authority to walk freely

97
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,916
aboard the ship. I am
also exempt from all labor.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,833
It's surprisingly
comfortable living here.

00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,041
Unfortunately,
Sisters Lucia and Angelene

100
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,416
don't have it as easy as I do.

101
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,250
They should've gotten away
when they had the chance.

102
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,583
It would have
been better that way.

103
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,583
If you do get out
of here in one piece,

104
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,958
you'll probably
want to stay away

from the Roman Orthodox Church.

106
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,875

how good our chances
of escape will be,

outnumbered we are.

That's strange coming from

That's one of Itsuwa's charms.

355
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,750
[KAMIJO] I'm curious. Can you
give us a bit more background

356
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,458
on the Queen of
the Adriatic Sea?

357
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,500
It's a long story, but we can
try and summarize it for you.

358
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,041
Venice and the
Roman Orthodox Church

359
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,541
weren't always on good terms.

360
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,500
So the Church decided that
it would be best to come up

361
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,833
with a way to obliterate
Venice in a single strike.

362
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,833
And thus, the Queen
of the Adriatic was born.

363
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:42,083
"Obliterate," huh?
How does it work?

364
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,250
Like a bomb or something?

365
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,708
This weapon
doesn't just destroy.

366
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,666
It's been specially
designed to steal all of

367
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,833
the city's culture
and history, as well.

368
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,333
That's extreme.

369
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,250
[ANGELENE] I can't imagine
that Sister Agnese knows about

370
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,916
any of this, though.
I'm certain she doesn't.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,416
If she did, she would try
to do something about it.

372
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,041
[TATEMIYA] So basically,
we need to go back

373
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,541
and rescue Agnese Sanctis.
Preferably before she can

374
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,791
be used to start
up some crazy weapon.

375
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,208
Well. That's easier said
than done, don't you think?

376
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,000
Difficult or not,
we have to do it.

377
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,500
Unless we find
a way to save her,

378
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,916
Sister Agnese's
mind will be shattered.

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,666
Do you expect us to
stand by and do nothing?

380
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,791
We have to help! As
long as I've known her,

381
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,833
Sister Agnese has
been there for me.

382
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,250
Now she's in need, and there
is no way I'm going to fail her!

383
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,583
That's great. Don't
suppose you have a plan?

384
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,541
We might be able to
use our own magic to stop

385
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,500
the fleet before they
can get any farther.

386
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,833
You think that's all there
is to dealing with the enemy?

387
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:34,666
Making sure they can't move?

388
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,958

[TATEMIYA] Hm?

392
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,708
[KAMIJO] We've been looking
at things the wrong way.

393
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,833
The question we should be
asking ourselves now isn't

394
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,375
"Why should we rescue her?"

395
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,416
Because we know the
answer to that already.

396
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,416
[KAMIJO] Agnese selflessly
gave up her own chance

397
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,916
to escape the ice fleet.

398

A sacrifice she
made for her friends.

399
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,791
If we don't do something her
mind is going to be destroyed,

400
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,541
and she'll just become
another one of their victims.

401
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,250
[KAMIJO] The question is
"How can we not rescue her?"

402
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,625
We'd be preventing the
destruction of Venice, right?

403
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,041
Think about it.
There's only one answer.

404
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,458
Is the Amakusa Church in
on this mission or not?

405
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,833
'Cause I'll do it
by myself if I have to!
