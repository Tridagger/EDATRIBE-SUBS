expecting the same from me,

175
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,958
because you'll be
so disappointed.

176
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,791
I should feel a sense
of duty? Man, is that rich.

177
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,291
I don't have any room
to spare for you up here.

178
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,208
Do you know how many of
you damn white-coated

179
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:42,083
researchers have screwed
around with my body?

180
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,791
Even I stopped keeping track!

181
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,916
I'm not wasting precious
brain cells remembering

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
every moment of the
experiments that were

183
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,541
done by all of you crack pots.

184
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,416
[AMATA] You are one of
the most vexing little punks

185
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,458
I've ever had to deal with.
Ending your miserable life

186
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:57,125
isn't going to be a chore
for me; it'll be a pleasure.

187
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,541
I'll actually be correcting
the egregious mistake

188
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,500
I made by not killing you before
when you were under my control.

189
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,625
I should have put you
down then. Oh well.

190
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,833
[AMATA] I can make up for
it now... with interest!

191
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:11,916
[ACCELERATOR]
What does this idiot think

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,583
that's gonna do to me?

193
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,791
So, how do I want to deal--

194
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,250
[AMATA grunts]

195
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
Uh!

196
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,666
[ACCELERATOR] My reflection.
It didn't work!

197
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,291
[AMATA] Do I have
your attention now?

198
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,666
Maybe you'll want to
take a moment to reflect

199
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,875
on the role I played
in developing the power

200
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,291
[AMATA] you've come
to depend upon so much.

201
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,458
Well, kid, is your
memory coming back?

202
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,416
Huh?

203
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,666
That's not like you.

204
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,083
[AMATA] Well, don't worry,
we'll take good care of her.

205
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,916
I'm going to beat you until
you're a stain on the ground,

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,166
but we'll keep the girl company.

207
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,541
Does that make
you feel better?

208
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,166
I know how sensitive you are.

209
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,166
[grunts]

210
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,250
[ACCELERATOR] Shut your damn
mouth. Don't you mock me.

211
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,791
You dirty bastard!

212
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,333
[AMATA] Sorry, kid.
That's not gonna do it.

213
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:21,375
[laughing]

214
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,833
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

215
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,166
You're an esper. Is that it?

216
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,750
You developed an esper
power in yourself.

217
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,375
[AMATA] What?

218
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,083
[laughs]

219
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,791
Oh, no.
That's not it at all.

220
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:46,208
Do you really think I
would experiment on myself

221
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,916
like I do on you lab rats?

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,541
I don't have to resort to
using that kind of power.

223
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:54,416
[AMATA] I can defeat you easily
enough without debasing myself.

224
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,625
These little guys'll be
enough to finish you off.

225
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,958
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

226
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,250
[screams]

227
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,958
I don't think so!

228
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,083
You're the one going down
tonight, you son of a bitch!

229
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,625
[AMATA]
One mistake after another.

230
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,416
You thought my gloves
contained the secret

231
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,750
to my power, didn't you?

232
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,000
Hate to tell you,
but you got it wrong!

233
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,875
[AMATA laughs]

234
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,291
[ACCELERATOR retches]

235
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,666
Are you still convinced
you're the strongest man here?

236
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,583
You piece of crap!

237
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,541
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

238
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,750
Your reflection isn't some kind
of immutable wall, you know.

239
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,041
In reality, it only
alters the vectors

240
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,041
of power sent at it from
the other direction.

241
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,250
That makes outsmarting
it pretty simple.

242
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,458
[AMATA] All I have to
do is yank back my fist

243
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,083
right before a direct hit.

244
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,166
Sometimes winning a
fight's all about knowing

245
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,750
when to pull a punch.

246
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,125
[AMATA] Basically, I just have
to stop short of hitting you,

247
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,666
and your reflection
does my work for me.

248
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,333
You get it now, my
accidental masochist?

249
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,416
Is that clear enough yet
for you, or would you like

250
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,333
some further explanation?

251
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,958
Think about that wind
you stirred up earlier.

252
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,291
At its most basic level,

253
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,625
your ability is the product
of vector formulas.

254
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:07,541
Meaning, I can render you
defenseless by disrupting them.

255
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
Jamming your power's easy.

256
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,375
I just have to call on
special sound waves.

257
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,125
[AMATA] I know everything
about you. Your character flaws,

258
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:18,291
your formulas, even your
own Personal Reality.

259
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,125
I made your power
into what it is.

260
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,208
I know you better than
you know yourself.

261
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,916
Now tell me, Accelerator,

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,541
do you understand the reason
we used her and not you?

263
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,708
[AMATA] I'm talking
about Project Radio Noise.

264
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,625
For our template we used
Railgun, the third-ranked.

265
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,458
Why wasn't it you,
when you're ranked first?

266
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:40,291
There's something there.
Some hidden bit of information.

267
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,833
Something you don't have
the first idea about.

268
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,708
Screw you, bastard.

269
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,541
Profound as always, I see.

270
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,958
Look, she seems pretty
thrilled about it herself.

271
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,958
[groans]

272
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,000
[AMATA] A successful recovery,
I guess you could say.

273
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,416
At least, I think so.

274
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,458
We were supposed to take
her alive, but looking at her

275
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,541
I'm not so sure we managed
that part of it now.

276
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:06,375
[AMATA] No way am I writing
up the mission report for this.

277
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,666
[ACCELERATOR] She's still
alive. She has to be.

278
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,708
I'd know if she were dead.

279
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:15,166
My sister's proxy calculations
would be affected.

280
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,791
I don't know where
they're taking her,

281
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:21,458
but... if I don't do something,
I doubt I'll ever see her again.

282
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,250
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

283
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,708
Last Order!

284
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,916
[HOUND DOGS groan]

285
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,666
[AMATA] Tch.

286
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,708
[ACCELERATOR retches]

287
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,750
[AMATA] Well, that was
a little melodramatic.

288
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:44,041
You could really stand to
work on your manners kid.

289
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,291
You know, most people don't like
to be sent flying like that.

290
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:50,583
Great, and who exactly is
supposed to track her down now?

291
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,708
'Cause it sure
isn't going to be me.

292
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,708
[HOUND DOG F] Orders, sir?

293
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,333
Eh, let me think a second.

294
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,125
Split yourselves
into three squads.

295
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,875
One of the squads will
go after the girl.

296
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,250
I want the other
two to stay with me.

297
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,500
[HOUND DOG F] But sir,

298
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,916
our first priority is
to recover Last Order.

299
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
[AMATA] Oh, yeah? Is that so?
You're the new guy, right?

300
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:10,291
You were only recently
assigned to Hound Dog.

301
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:11,416
[HOUND DOG F] Um, I...

302
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,041
At ease, man, it's okay.

303
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,458
It's not like I'm
doing a background check

304
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,166
here or anything.

305
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
However, you don't
seem to know the rules,

306
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,500
so let me educate you.

307
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,833
You guys matter about
as much as pond scum.

308
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,875
That's how much I care
about your opinions.

309
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,166
The other thing about scum--

310
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,166
no one gives a crap
about what happens to it.

311
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
[AMATA] So interfere with
my mission if that's what

312
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,208
you really wanna do,
but killing you isn't

313
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,833
gonna make me lose any sleep.

314
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,375
Do we understand each other?

315
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,666
Your life is worth
less than nothing.

316
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,041
Well, speak up, man! Do you
understand what I'm saying?

317
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,500
[HOUND DOG F] Uh.

318
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,500
[AMATA] All right!
I'm glad that's clear.

319
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,375
Take a squad and search
the rivers and reservoirs,

320
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,375
and any other large
bodies of water.

321
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:50,750
He wouldn't have blown
the kid sky high unless

322
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,791
he'd already calculated a
safe place for her to land.

323
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,375
[HOUND DOG F] What should
we do about the esper boy?

324
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:56,500
Take him back with us?

325
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,916
No, go ahead and kill him.

326
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,916
There's no reason to
take him into custody.

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,208
Looking at him just reminds
me of the mistake I made

328
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,875
in not doing away
with him sooner.

329
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,833
He's nothing but a moody,
self-absorbed little brat.

330
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:10,125
Let's do the world a favor and
eliminate him here and now.

331
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:10,916
[ACCELERATOR] Shut up.

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,333
[AMATA] Huh?

333
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,791
You don't get it, do you?

334
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,750
And you're not gonna.
Not as long as you live.

335
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,875
Yeah? That's a shame.

336
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:21,333
[AMATA] Well, I hope
you don't mind those being

337
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:24,666
your last words, 'cause
now's the part where you die.

338
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,375
[ACCELERATOR] Damn it. Somebody.

339
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,708
Someone please show up.

340
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,291
I don't care who you are.

341
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,083
I don't even care if
you want to trample me

342
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,916
and laugh while you do it.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,875
But somebody, anybody
at all... save the kid.

344
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,125
[INDEX] Excuse me.
What's going on over there?

345
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,250
[KAMIJO panting]

346
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,125
Ah, Index, why do
you always do this?

347
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,708
One second you're
there, and the next

348
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,708
you've disappeared
all over again.

349
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,625
I don't understand why you
can't be more considerate.

350
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,875
[INDEX] When I couldn't find
you earlier, the nice boy with

351
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,208
the white hair
bought me a hamburger

352
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,791
and he didn't even know
the first thing about me.

353
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,333
I hope you meet
each other someday.

354
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
You could learn a thing or
two from him about manners.

355
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,958
Yeah, whatever. I'm sure
this Prince Charming

356
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,625
was real impressed by your
manners, too. Speaking of.

357
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,208
I don't suppose you
remembered to thank him

358
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:19,791
for buying you food?

359
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,375
[INDEX] Yes! Unlike you, I care
about other people's feelings!

360
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,708
What's the matter?

361
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,833
I did forget something.
He let me borrow these.

362
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:27,875
Wasn't that nice?

363
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,166
Yeah, that's just
a packet of tissues.

364
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,166
True! But it says
here that this is

365
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,625
a "convenient product for
everyday use," so he could

366
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,375
need one any moment now,
couldn't he? I have to go.

367
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,208
I'm sure he would like these
back as soon as possible.

368
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,500
That's the kind of thing
people don't want back.

369
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,916
Hey!

370
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,208
[KAMIJO] Here we go. I feel like
I'm always running after her.

371
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,750
[KAMIJO] Oh, great.
And it's raining.

372
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,500
She didn't have an
umbrella with her.

373
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,125
She must be getting
soaked to the bone.

374
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,666
[KAMIJO] There're more Antiskill
out than there normally are.

375
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,541
I hope I can find Index quickly
before there's any trouble.

378
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,333
Excuse me sir, are you okay?

379
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,500
Can you hear me? Officer?

380
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,583
[bodies thud]

381
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,791
[whispering] Whoa.

382
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:33,250
[KAMIJO] What's going on here?

383
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,625
At least it doesn't seem
to be life-threatening.

384
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,291
This many. I wonder what the
hell happened to all of them.

385
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:45,250
[radio static]

386
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,125
[ANTISKILL A]
In the metro area. Repeat.

387
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:50,583
Gate destruction confirmed.
Intruders in the metro area.

388
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:53,791
We're under attack, but the
assailants are unkn-- Ahh!

389
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,583
Intruders nearby?
I need to hurry!

390
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,041
[sobs]

391
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,000
[gasps] It's you!

392
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,041
"I need your help!"

393
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,166
"Hurry, come with me!

394
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,833
There's something
that we have to do!"

395
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,458
pleads Misaka Misaka,
begging with all her heart.

396
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,416
[WOMAN laughs]

397
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,666
[WOMAN] Hi! You there, Aleister?

398
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,791
[WOMAN] I know you make a
habit of secretly listening in

399
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,916
on communications, so there's
no point in playing coy.

400
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,916
Seriously, this would
go a whole lot faster

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,625
if you would say
something already.

402
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,500
[radio static]

403
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,375
[ALEISTER]
Very well. Let's chat.

404
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,958
Ha, ha. I just completed a
mission that involved disgracing

405
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,750
three members of
the governing board.

406
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,791
I expect you'll be wanting
to retaliate soon.

407
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,000
[ALEISTER] They can be replaced
as many times as necessary.

408
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,791
Huh. I had thought
for sure that doing away

409
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,458
[WOMAN] with your puppets
on the board would finally

410
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,250
motivate you to take some
action. It seems like I may have

411
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,375
misread the situation,
however. Oh, well.

412
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,708
You do know to whom you
are speaking, don't you?

413
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,625
[ALEISTER] I'm afraid not.

414
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,250
The Right Seat of God.

415
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,708
[WOMAN]
If you want to play dumb,

416
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,375
that's completely fine as well.

417
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,458
I just don't want you to
have any regrets later.

418
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,541
[ALEISTER]
Don't you think you may be

419
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,333
underestimating this city?

420
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,875
[WOMAN] I think that you
are overestimating it.

421
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,375
Which is really quite sad.

422
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,625
Antiskill and Judgment.
Your two shields.

423
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,875
You've ended up with your
head in a noose because

424
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,791
you relied upon those toothless
outfits to protect you.

425
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,750
Without them, you're finished.

426
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:40,375
And they'll hardly
be a challenge.

427
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,666
[ALEISTER] If you and your
organization truly believe

428
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,500
that is all it will
take to bring down

429
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:48,583
Academy City's defense network,
you are sadly mistaken.

430
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,583
It's becoming obvious
you have no idea

431
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,916
what this city's true form is.

432
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,583
Oh, yeah?

433
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,958
[ALEISTER] Whether you like it
or not, you aren't the only one

434
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,791
with a trick or two
up your sleeve.

435
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,500
Of course, I don't imagine
you're going to have

436
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,791
the chance to use
any of those tricks.

437
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,166
[WOMAN] Say what you want.

438
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,333
I will crush anything or
anyone who stands in my way.

439
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:12,500
That has been written in stone
from the moment I was born.

440
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,916
You say you don't know me?

441
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,416
Well, I am Vento of the Front.

442
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,833
I am the deadliest weapon

443
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:20,166
among the Roman Orthodox
Church's two billion faithful.

444
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,958
Nothing can stand before me
when I decide to destroy it.

445
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,000
That includes your
precious Academy City,

446
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,750
and the List of
Prohibited Books,

447
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,583
and Imagine Breaker, as well.

448
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,750
You will all fall before me.

449
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,458
[ALEISTER] Interesting.
It looks like I'll finally have

450
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,500
the chance to use one of
those tricks I've been saving.

451
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,208
[ALEISTER] It may be too soon,
but we'll try it out.

452
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,375
After all, it's these
unexpected events that provide

453
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,000
for the greatest amusement.

454
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,666
Call Hound Dog. Amata Kihara.

455
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,208

the AIM diffusion field.

00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,333
It is a bit earlier
than we expected,

459
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:05,083
but we will crush them easily
enough using Fuse Kazakiri.

460
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:08,583
Once you have successfully
retrieved 20001,

461
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,541
bring her to the
designated location.

462
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,958
[ALEISTER] Do it swiftly
but courteously.

463
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,500
[AMATA] Roger that.

464
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,500
[ALEISTER] Now then.

465
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:22,416
I have been looking forward
to this for quite a while.

466
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,916
