1
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,958
[TSUCHIMIKADO] Three is for
heaven, four is for earth,

2
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,083
and twelve represents
the entire world.

3
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:40,166
You attach meaning to specific
numbers like that, don't you?

4
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,791
The practice of
numerological divination.

5
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,458
It's a very useful system,
but it didn't start

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,333
with the church of the cross.

7
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,958
In fact, the ancient Greeks used
it back in Pythagoras' day.

8
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,333
Which would make
that date BCE.

9
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,625
[TSUCHIMIKADO] That's a bit
earlier in history than you guys

10
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,041
usually like to dabble.

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,541
[screech]

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,291
There's no point getting
involved in a drawn-out battle.

13
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,500
It's quite a shame, really.

14
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:23,416
A finely-wrought
spell like this.

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,541
It nearly breaks my
heart to destroy it.

16
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,750
[grunts]


17
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:10,250
[ACCELERATOR] I'm screwed if
I have to fight too many times.

18
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,000
[ACCELERATOR] I don't have
even four solid minutes of

19
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,375
ability mode left on this thing.

20
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
[ACCELERATOR] I plan on
using them well, though.

21
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,625
Whatever else,
I'm gonna save the kid.

22
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,916
[MAN] The whole building is
clear. There's nobody around.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,250
It's all here in the report.

24
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,125
It's because we're
under a terrorist threat.

25
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:41,166
They evacuated the staff and
the patients temporarily;

26
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,375
all of 'em.

27
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:43,833
Which means they're
onto us, then.

28
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,125
Yeah, not good for us.

29
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:50,416
[phone ringing]

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,916
What d'you think?
Could it be a trap?

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,708
Doubt it. I haven't
spotted any wires

32
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,125
or infrared anywhere.

33
00:03:55,208 --> 00:04:03,041
[phone ringing]

34
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,125
[FROG DOCTOR] About time.
It took you long enough.

35
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,333
Heaven Canceller?

36
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,041
[FROG DOCTOR] We're in a hurry,
so I'll keep this brief.

37
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,416
Leave Kihara behind and get
yourselves out of there.

38
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,333
If you don't go, your
lives will be in danger.

39
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,291
Leave now? Are you serious?

40
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,791
[FROG DOCTOR] Accelerator is
headed in your direction.

41
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,291
[sighs]

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,416
[FROG DOCTOR] Trust me when
I say he's not holding back.

43
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,000
You should steer clear of
him if you value your life.

44
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,791
It's that simple.

45
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,625
Heh. You're overreacting.

46
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,791
[FROG DOCTOR] Very well.
Try to stay alive.

47
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,166
If you're still breathing,
I can save you.

48
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,041
[HOUND DOG screams]

49
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,208
[laughs]

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,666
[coughs]

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,666
[FEMALE NEWSCASTER] We are
currently receiving reports from

52
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,083
all over the country of people
suddenly losing consciousness.

53
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:55,000
Law enforcement
officers say they are

54
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,208
identifying the cause
as swiftly as they can.

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,250
The phenomenon does not appear
to be limited to our country...

56
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,250
It appears to be spreading
to other countries as well.

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,875
[VENTO] All we really
needed was to have

58
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,750
Academy City under our control.

59
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:14,916
[phone buzzes]

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,708
Last Order's calling?

61
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,750
No, it must be Kihara.

62
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,125
[KAMIJO] Oh, good! I didn't
think I was gonna reach anyone.

63
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,000
[ACCELERATOR] I've heard this
voice somewhere before.

64
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,708
[KAMIJO] I've been going through
and calling all the numbers

65
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,875
in Last Order's cell phone.

66
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,500
You're the only one
who answered so far.

67
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,250
You probably don't
know the situation,

68
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,541
but to put it plainly,
she and I could really

69
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,666
use some help right about now.

70
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,166
[KAMIJO] Last Order's in danger.

71
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,000
What exactly
is the situation?

72
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,583
[ACCELERATOR] You had to split
up at the restaurant, huh?

73
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,625
I can take care of all
this from here on out.

74
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,541
You're all done.
Just get rid of that phone

75
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,458
and go back to your
regularly scheduled life.

76
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,000
Sorry, but that's
not happening.

77
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,583
I'll help save her.
Just tell me what to do.

78
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,500
Okay, fine. You know that huge
bridge in School District 7?

79
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,625
Last Order and I set that
as our rendezvous point

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,208
in case
anything happened.

81
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,958
If she's still on the run,
that's the first place

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,666
she'll be headed.

83
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
Okay. I'll go there!

84
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,125
Something is going
on in Academy City.

85
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,833
There have been some
strange intruders

86
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,291
coming in from the outside.

87
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,458
Meanwhile, people here

88
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,875
are dropping like flies,
Antiskill included.

89
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,458
This attack seems fairly
indiscriminate so far.

90
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,833
So watch your back, okay?

91
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,416
Tch. Just keeps
getting better.

92
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,625
[KAMIJO] I'm sorry about this.
I never should have let her

93
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,041
go out there on her own.

94
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,083
Well, you're not
the only one.

95
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,250
I just meant to leave the
kid alone for five minutes,

96
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,666
and look what happened.

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,208
[HOUND DOG A] We've lost
contact with multiple squads.

98
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,583
[AMATA] Which means...

99
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,791
Either they ran
away or they're dead.

100
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,083
Whatever the case, I'll be
collecting all their hearts

101
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,916
when we're done here.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,375
[AMATA] Have you recovered
the group we sent out as decoys

103
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,291
when that woman got in our way?

104
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,583
[HOUND DOG A] Yes.

105
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:53,166
We're not completely sure
what happened, sir.

106
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Their oxygen levels had
dropped extremely low.

107
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,166
Sounds like some kind
of induced asphyxia.

108
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
[sighs]

109
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,166
That woman's responsible.

110
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,333
Damn her! If she's
the reason our boys

111
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,791
are out cold, we'll
teach her a less--

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,666
[AMATA] Huh?

113
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,541
[HOUND DOGS chatter]

114
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,625
[AMATA] Her again, but how
is she locating her targets?

115
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,208
Not with science. Is it magic?

116
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,666
Listen up, Hound Dogs.
Whatever else is going on,

117
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,166
our plans haven't changed.
Is the Testament rig ready?

118
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,625
[HOUND DOG B] Yes, sir.

119
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,291
[HOUND DOG B] Right here.

120
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,541
[ACCELERATOR pained exhale]

121
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,708
I've seen that before.
It belongs to her.

122
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:47,625
[phone buzzes]

123
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,750
[AMATA] Hey, Accelerator!
How're things going?

124
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,625
[laughs]

125
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,791
[ACCELERATOR] I'm a little busy.
Was there something you wanted?

126
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,583
[AMATA] Well,
I was just wondering

127
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,166
if you'd found the present
I left behind for you.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,333
If not, you should
keep your eyes open.

129
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,541
It's a small bit of fabric
from a child's shirt.

130
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,583
On a totally different subject,

131
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,125
Testament is really
something else, huh?

132
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,666
It just isn't normal to cram

133
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,208
a virus right into a
person's head, you know?

134
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,375
[laughs]

135
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,000
[ACCELERATOR]
So, what kind of reaction

136
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,666
are you expecting from me?

137
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,083
[AMATA] Huh?

138
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,541
Am I supposed to start shaking
and laugh a crazy laugh?

139
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,583
Or what?

140
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:26,750
[AMATA] You should be careful.

141
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,375
I'm the one holding
all the cards.

142
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,250
The kid's life is in my hands.

143
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,666
Heh! So why haven't you
gotten around to killing her,

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,750
I wonder? Were you
given an order

145
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,416
from the people who hired you?

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,250
Was it that standard line about
not damaging the merchandise?

147
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,291
I know you're not always
good at following directions.

148
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,916
Your bosses must
be hardcore.

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Can't believe they've got
you shaking in your boots

150
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,833
at the thought of hurting
a little kid like her.

151
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,541
[AMATA] She will die.

152
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:53,791
[ACCELERATOR] Not yet she won't.
I know that bastard.

153
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,708
After everything I've said
to him, he should have

154
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,625
at least taken one of
her eyes out already,

155
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:00,666
and that's if he
was in a good mood.

156
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,583
Since he hasn't, that
can mean only one thing.

157
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:08,291
Well, well. Amata Kihara's
actually under someone's thumb.

158
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,208
A backer powerful
enough to keep even

159
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,791
that dog on his leash?

160
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,083
In Academy City, that
leaves one possibility.

161
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,166
It must be the
governing board.

162
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,875
If I look into them--
Heh, heh, heh!

163
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,583
That's what I'm talking about.

164
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm finally making some
headway now! Ha, ha, ha!

165
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:30,708
Fine. You wanna
screw with me?

166
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,125
Then I'll screw
with you right back!

167
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,708
[grunts]

168
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,291
[yells]

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,625
[gasps]

170
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:07,583
[yells]

171
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,333
[ALEISTER] Hm. There seems
to be some kind of commotion

172
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,416
going on out front.

173
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,125

00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,375
If any magic is invoked within
the limits of Academy City,

177
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,416
the magician wielding it will
lose control and self-destruct.

did you say your name was?

can detect but not identify,

talking about, boy?

think they're messing with,

freaked her out so much?

[KAMIJO] What does that mean?

333
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,875
[INDEX] Its potency comes from
one very strong emotion.

The person who feels it can
take out multiple targets,

regardless of location or
range. It's very powerful.

336

When you fought her, did
you get any indication of

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,833
what she might
have been feeling?

338
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,208
Did she seem to be projecting
one particular emotion

339
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,041
to the exclusion
of all others?

340
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,541
Let me think.
A particular emotion.

You mean that's it?
So then her anger is

343
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,875
the key to making
her magic function?

344
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,958
[INDEX] Yeah. As for
the people who have been

345
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,875
knocked unconscious,
I don't think they'll be able

346
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,791
to recover until the magician
decides that Divine Retribution

347
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,083
is no longer needed.

348
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,333
And what about the way
Kazakiri's angel works?

349
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,708
Do you think that she's gonna
make it through this okay?

350
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,375
I really can't be sure.
Some of the magic does feel

351
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,000
familiar to me. But then
she's also doing some stuff

352
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,291
that I've never seen before.

353
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,166
I don't know what to
make of it. I feel lost.

354
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,166
There is one thing, though.
I don't know how much

355
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,041
it really tells us,
but the angel over there

356
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,375
and the core
that's directing it

357
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,791
[INDEX] are in two
different places altogether.

358
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,166
It tells us she's still on
our side, and that's enough.

359
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,666
[phone rings]

360
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,791
[INDEX] What's going on now?
Who are you calling?

361
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,875
[KAMIJO] Damn! No answer.

362
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,625
Is there anybody
besides Miss Komoe

363
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,041
who would understand this?

364
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,583
[phone rings]

365
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,625
Hey, Misaka?

366
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,041
[MIKOTO] Uh--Kinda busy here!

367
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,958
I think I may have an idea
about how to stop the angel.

368
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,791
I'm probably gonna need
your help with it, though.

369
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:24,791
[gunfire over phone]

370
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:25,666
Hey, what's going
on over there?

371
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,416
You didn't get shot, did you?

372
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,833
[MIKOTO] Not yet. You know,
talking on the phone while

373
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,416
I'm fighting doesn't
work so well.

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,416
Do you think we could chat
about this another time?

375
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,041
[KAMIJO] No. All right, Index.

376
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,291
If there's anything you don't
understand, then just ask her.

377
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,333
Huh?

378
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,625
[AMATA] Ha-ha!
Awesome light show.

379
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,625
I wonder what the hell it is.

380
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,416
Damn that Aleister.
What is he thinking?

381
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,208
I always knew he was
insane, but seriously.

382
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,416
Where does he get off
calling himself a scientist

383
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,125
when his methods are
so very unscientific?

384
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,541
You guys know what I'm saying?

385
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,083
[AMATA] He's messing with
things outside his scope!

386
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,541
Hmm?

387
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,833
[HOUND DOG B grunts]

388
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,666
Heh, heh, heh.
I found you, Kihara!

389
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,708
[HOUND DOG D grunts]

390
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,375
Whoopsie. That aim
could use some work.

391
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,000
If you're going to kill me,

392
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,958
[AMATA] you'll have to
try a lot harder than that.

393
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,666
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

394
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,125
[HOUND DOG F] Uh!

395
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,166
[HOUND DOG G] Don't move!

396
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,375
[ACCELERATOR grunts]

397
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,666
[HOUND DOG G whimpers]

398
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,125
[HOUND DOG G yells]

399
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,833
Well, bravo!

400
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,958
I think I just fell in love
a little bit, Accelerator!

401
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,958
Okay, enough. I'm done
screwing around now.

402
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:48,333
Die, you dirty son of a bitch!

403
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,041
[KAMIJO] Kazakiri.

404
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,708
Kazakiri!

405
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,458
I'm coming!

406
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,833
I'll help y--[grunts]

407
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,291
[KAMIJO] Damn it!

408
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
[VENTO] Well, well,
look at this.

409
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,250
Two despicable sinners
together in one place.

410
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,916
I guess like really
calls to like.

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,041
I was planning to save
you for some other time,

412
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,541
yet here you are again.

413
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,500
Just couldn't stand waiting
any longer, could you?

414
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:36,875
[VENTO laughs]

415
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,083
I get it. You figure if
you're the next one to die,

416
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,416
you won't have to bear witness
to more sorrow and misery.

417
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,083
I won't let you hurt Kazakiri!

418
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,625
[VENTO] Then I'm afraid
we're at an impasse.

419
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,541
Because as a member of
the Right Seat of God,

420
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,333
I cannot turn a blind eye
to that monstrosity.

421
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,333
That thing is
blasphemy personified;

422
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,708
sacrilege on two legs!

423
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,416
Its very existence
is an affront

424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,791
[VENTO] to all loyal
followers of the cross!

425
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,666
Shut up! That's enough!

426
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,958
[VENTO] Oh, calm down. I'll
show some mercy and kill you.

427
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,625
You and that fallen angel
you care so much about.

428
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,833
[KAMIJO] You won't touch
a hair on her head!

429
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,791
She's been through
enough already.

430
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
I won't let her fall into
the hands of someone

431
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,166
who thinks she's a monster!

432
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,208
You want to come after her,
you'll have to get through me.

433
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,416
[KAMIJO] Do you understand?

434
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,041
For the last time, stay
the hell away from my friend!

435
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:59,833
[KAMIJO] The fight for the city
intensifies on every front.

436
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:02,083
Will Index be able to find
an answer in the chaos

437
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,166
created by magic and science?

438
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,666
Next time, "The Divine
Retribution Spell."

439
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,375
When science and magic
cross paths, a story is born.
