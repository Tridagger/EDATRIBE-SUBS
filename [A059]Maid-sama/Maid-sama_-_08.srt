1
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:38,264
If you think you can get away
with calling our students
"insects," you're wrong!

2
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,701
I demand an apology!

3
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,070
Misaki Ayuzawa, would you
please do me the honor

4
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,472
of joining the
Miyabigaoka Student Council?

5
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,210
I will personally
ensure that you have
everything you need.

6
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,179
Please consider my offer.

7
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,450
Now you know what it means
to be the "dominant" one.

8
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,586
I don't ever want to
see you again.

9
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,121
Just leave me alone.

10
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,809
You're from...
Miyabigaoka, right?

11
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:28,682
Indeed. I am Maki,
Vice President of
the Student Council.

12
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,050
Can I help you?

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,853
Might I have a word
with you, Miss Ayuzawa?

14
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:34,921
Uh...

15
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,592
Gentlemen.

16
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,726
Sir!

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,598
Please accept these.

18
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,167
They are small tokens
of our appreciation.

19
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,470
No, please don't,
I couldn't possibly accept
such expensive gifts.

20
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:56,442
It is Mr. Igarashi's most
heartfelt wish that you transfer
to Miyabigaoka High School.

21
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,845
I'm not going to change my mind
because of a few gifts.

22
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,948
I'm sorry you came
all the way over here,
but please take these with you.

23
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:06,520
But these cakes were made
especially for you in my
family's very own shop.

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,655
What a shame to
see them go to waste.

25
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,690
Oh...

26
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,091
Please rest assured.

27
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,261
Mr. Igarashi has no intention of
"buying" you with these gifts.

28
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,698
Please accept them freely
and without reservation.

29
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,099
Uh...

30
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,202
Mr. Igarashi wishes
to work closely with you

31
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,105
in order to improve
Miyabigaoka High School.

32
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,240
That is his sole desire.

33
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,144
I'm home.

34
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,346
Oh. Welcome back, Suzuna.

35
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,949
Oh look.
Unfamiliar uniforms.

36
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,519
Are these more of the
Ayuzawa Cram School weirdos?

37
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:42,556
No, that's not it! Just go
to your room or something!

38
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,124
[SUZUNA]
I'll make go make some tea.

39
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,594
Please excuse her!
She's a little unusual...

40
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,996
If you do decide to
transfer to Miyabigaoka,

41
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,599
our president has said that
your sister would receive

42
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,568
automatic admission into
our school as well.

43
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,870
Uh, that's a nice offer,
but that's impossible.

44
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:02,776
The influence that the Igarashi
Conglomerate has over
Miyabigaoka is absolute.

45
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:07,313
For your sister's sake and
your own, please consider
our proposition carefully.

46
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,317
This shall only stand
for another three days.

47
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,655
We look forward to
your response.

48
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,123
But that's...

49
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,126
Mr. Igarashi shall
await you at Miyabigaoka,

50
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,729
to hear your final decision.

51
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,572
What's wrong, Misaki?
You're spacing out.

52
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,839
Uh...

53
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,541
Don't tell me!
Were you thinking about Tora?!

54
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,241
Who?

55
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,743
The Igarashi heir,

56
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,913
Miyabigaoka's Student Council
President, Tora Igarashi!

57
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:43,449
Misaki, you're not gonna leave
us for Miyabigaoka, are you?!

58
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,285
[MISAKI]
Of course I'm not.

59
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,020
You can't just abandon
me and Shizuko!

60
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,557
We rely on you way too much!
What would we do without you?!

61
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,994
Sakura! Please refrain from
such careless comments!

62
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,631
Misaki's future is of far
greater importance than our
transitory feelings!

63
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,399
Although we would
miss her dearly,

64
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,967
It would be selfish of us to
hold her back from going to

65
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,969
the school of her dreams and
realizing her true potential.

66
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,871
Misaki's future?

67
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,041
What if she transferred
and romance blossomed
be her and Tora?!

68
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,911
She could be Tora's wife!
Mrs. Igarashi!

69
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:15,015
She'd be living the
big life, courtesy of
the Igarashi Conglomerate!

70
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,721
[IWAKURA]
It'd be a lot better than if
she stayed here, right?

71
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,923
[KAMAKARI]
I mean, everyone
wants to go there.

72
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,826
It's an ultra‐elite private
school, we all know that.

73
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,228
No one turns something
like that down.

74
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,763
There's no reason
she should.

75
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,832
Well, on the bright side,
if she did leave,

76
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,868
we could go back to doing
whatever we wanted like before.

77
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,270
Ow!

78
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,938
Huh?

79
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,040
Why?!

80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,575
I better not hear another word
like that outta your mouths!

81
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,176
That huuurt!
What'd you do that for?!

82
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,246
Even when we got in trouble
with those Miyabigaoka guys,

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,981
she believed in us,
and stood up for us!

84
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,284
Do you idiots even
understand how much
she cares about all of us?

85
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,719
Well, do you?!

86
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,091
Yeah, of course we do, man.

87
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,628
But if she says she wants to
transfer to Miyabigaoka...

88
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,665
Then it wouldn't be
right to stop her.

89
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,035
I was out for awhile,
but I'm back!

90
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,370
You turned into ash.

91
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,506
Now to take care of all this
backed up work...

92
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,742
Oh! Mr. Usui! Ah!

93
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,746
How many times do I
have to tell you?

94
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,115
Don't come into the Student
Council room unless you
need something.

95
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,017
Yukimura's terrified.

96
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,552
I DO need something.

97
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,321
What are you gonna do
about Miyabigaoka?

98
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,658
I am Seika High's
Student Council President!

99
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,028
If I left, the school
would go back to the
way it was before...

100
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,067
Still, it might be nice
to finally get away from
a stalker like you.

101
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,539
She's transferring to
Miyabigaoka?!
What's going on?

102
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,942
Did something happen
while I was gone?

103
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:53,780
Huh? Where's Mom?

104
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,619
The hospital called.
They needed her to come in
for another night shift.

105
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,754
She's pushing herself
way too hard.

106
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:04,224
She's a single mom trying
to raise two daughters
without any help.

107
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,693
There're going to be times
where she's going to
have to push herself.

108
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,862
Yes, I know, but...

109
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,063
Dinner is ready.

110
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,800
Whoa, What's with this feast?!

111
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,036
Did those Miyabigaoka
guys stop by again?!

112
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,172
No, they didn't.
I made all of this by myself.

113
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,243
Bean curd croquettes, bean curd
salad, bean curd imitation crab,

114
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:27,447
bean curd imitation
roast chicken, and
bean curd imitation sashimi.

115
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,816
That's ALL bean curd?
I don't believe it!

116
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,519
It is. Bean curd is cheap
but packed with nutrients.

117
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:36,056
Since we don't have a lot of
money, we have to be more
creative with our food.

118
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:39,025
I'm sorry for making things
hard on you too, Suzuna.

119
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,260
It's not your fault.

120
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,629
It's Dad's fault,
for running off on us.

121
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,498
Anyway, cooking
like this is fun.

122
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,499
Thanks for the meal.

123
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,134
Let's eat!

124
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,506
This is great.

125
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:55,308
Hey, Suzuna...

126
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,511
Would you like to go
to Miyabigaoka?

127
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,513
Why? Isn't that school
only for rich, smart kids?

128
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,247
It's not like I'd
be able to get in anyway.

129
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,383
But what if you could go?

130
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,719
Hmm... If we had
that kind of money...

131
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,488
I'd rather spend it on
REAL crab. Why do you ask?

132
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,958
Oh, I was just
curious, I guess.

133
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,797
It's hard to believe
this is all just bean curd.

134
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,765
And for dessert, we have
those expensive cakes

135
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,333
the Ayuzawa Cram School brought.

136
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,905
I already told you‐
they weren't the
Ayuzawa Cram School!

137
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,141
(Music playing)

138
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:24,297
Geeeez. Where did
Misaki run off to?

139
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,734
I doubt Misaki would want to
go to something like that
in the first place...

140
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,702
Huh?

141
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,070
Truthfully,
I don't want to either.

142
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,705
C'mon, I know if you
see them once,

143
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,507
you'll definitely
be hooked for sure!

144
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:34,708
Lookie, lookie!

145
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,977
Oh! Aren't they dreamy?!

146
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,479
They wear more makeup than I do.

147
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,247
"You times mishi?"

148
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,517
No, it's "Yumemishi!" Hehe.

149
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,885
You misread that
on purpose, didn't you!

150
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,620
No, I just really
didn't care.

151
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,722
I'm gonna go ahead
and call her!

152
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:49,990
Hello, Misaki?

153
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,124
[MISAKI]
Sakura?

154
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,759
Where are you?

155
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,061
Uh... I'm at Miyabigaoka.

156
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,663
Huh?

157
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:00,333
What are you doing there?
What's going on, Misaki?

158
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,437
Sakura... sorry, but I'll
have to call you back later.

159
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,639
Wait, Misaki‐

160
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:27,027
(Phone ringing)

161
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,328
Oh, Misaki?

162
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,964
The person you are trying
to trach is not available‐

163
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,733
What did she say?

164
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,400
It's no good.
I can't get through.

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,471
She's at Miyabigaoka
right now, isn't she?

166
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,874
Just what does she think
she's doing?

167
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,845
Why does she try to do
everything all by herself?

168
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,882
Don't worry.
I'll think of something.

169
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,384
It would be selfish of us to
hold her back from going to

170
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,019
the school of her dreams and
realizing her true potential.

171
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,355
She could be Tora's wife!
Mrs. Igarashi!

172
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,158
She'd be living the big life,
courtesy of the
Igarashi Conglomerate!

173
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:02,963
Don't worry. I'm sure
Misaki will be able to
handle things just fine.

174
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,765
You were right,
Sakura.

175
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,366
We DO rely on her too much.

176
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,603
So much, that we've forgotten
to ask her how she felt.

177
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:13,473
It's no wonder she couldn't
talk to us about
anything important.

178
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,941
So you're fine
with her leaving?

179
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,110
If she really transferred
to Miyabigaoka,

180
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,379
are you saying
you wouldn't be sad?

181
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,748
Sakura...
Huh?

182
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,517
If we want to get Misaki back,

183
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:25,485
then let's march
right over to Miyabigaoka

184
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,120
and bring her
back ourselves!

185
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,689
Yeah!

186
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,459
(Students chatter)

187
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,828
A pleasure to see you.

188
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,229
Is your mother doing well?

189
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:39,065
Yes. Where will you be
vacationing next?

190
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:42,969
[MISAKI]
I didn't really notice
the last time we were here,

191
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:48,308
but Miyabigaoka is like a
completely different world.

192
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:52,713
Sir, Misaki Ayuzawa of
Seika High School
has arrived.

193
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,447
Is that so?

194
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,217
Then I'll give her
a proper greeting.

195
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,418
This is a first!

196
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,888
That you've been so enamored
with a single girl?

197
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:07,360
I see, you think no woman
could ever be enough to
satisfy me, do you, Maki?

198
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:16,002
For the longest time, I thought
the same thing myself...

199
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,074
Hehe...

200
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:47,033
Miss Ayuzawa. I'm delighted that
you've decided to officially
honor us with your presence.

201
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,069
President Igarashi...

202
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,205
I'm see you've come to
discuss your acceptance
of my previous offer.

203
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,907
Actually...

204
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,442
Actually, about‐

205
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,644
Uh, whoa!

206
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,813
Uh?

207
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,484
[SHIROKAWA]
Why isn't Misa here
today of all days?!

208
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,786
Even though today is...

209
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,521
Shiroyan's birthday!

210
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,355
I wanted her to
congratulate me!

211
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,493
Ikkun, Kurotatsu...
I can't go on...

212
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:14,528
Shiroyan!

213
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,662
Pull yourself together!

214
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,663
(Crying)

215
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,964
Hey! Shiroyan!

216
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,700
Hey, man, c'mon...

217
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,468
[HONOKA]
Excuse us, Masters.

218
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,104
We may not be Misa, but...

219
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,140
...do you mind if we offer our
congratulations instead?

220
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,109
And we made you
something special!

221
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,578
We baked this original
Maid Latte birthday cake

222
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,713
just for you, Masters!

223
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,480
And not to worry!

224
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,118
This is free of charge for you,
our most loyal customers!

225
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,387
We're so happy.

226
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,490
But it has "Three Idiots"
written on it.

227
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,926
I feel confused...

228
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,394
If it's free,
who cares?!

229
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,531
Excuse me.

230
00:13:50,631 --> 00:13:52,132
Huh?

231
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,735
Sorry, but Shizuko has
something she wants to say!

232
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:59,105
Is there no one here who will
go with us to Miyabigaoka
to retrieve Misaki?

233
00:13:59,205 --> 00:13:59,906
Huh?

234
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,474
At this very moment,

235
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,544
our President is at
Miyabigaoka all by herself.

236
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:05,178
She is?!

237
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,314
If she truly does intend to
transfer to Miyabigaoka,
so be it.

238
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,018
But if we do nothing to stop
her, are we not truly at fault?

239
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,722
It may be selfish of me
to ask this, but I...

240
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,990
I don't want Misaki to leave,

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,059
I want her to stay here
at Seika with us!

242
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,994
All of you do too, don't you?!

243
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:25,031
You're right!
I can't imagine another
president besides Miss Ayuzawa!

244
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,432
Let's go get her!

245
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,834
Yeah, that's right.

246
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:28,802
Okay...

247
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,704
Let's go!

248
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:31,605
You can count us in, too.

249
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,839
Yeah.

250
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,708
Then let's go, everyone!

251
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,176
Yeah!

252
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,846
That's a rich school for you.

253
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,850
Having showers right next to
the student council room
is definitely not normal.

254
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,318
More importantly...

255
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,922
Why did this have to happen
to me in the first place!

256
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,629
It's gone! But I could've
sworn I put it right here.

257
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,397
Was it a different locker?

258
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,232
It's not here either.

259
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,033
There it is!

260
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,468
Gah! What is this?!

261
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,770
(Knock at door)

262
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,305
[IGARASHI]
Miss Ayuzawa!
Are you all right?

263
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,908
Um, I can't seem to find
my school uniform anywhere.

264
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,843
Oh, yes. I didn't want
the stain to set,

265
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,913
so I had one of our girls
take it to the cleaner for you.
It'll be ready soon.

266
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:16,116
That's great, but,
what am I supposed to
wear in the meantime?

267
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,653
What's that?
We already prepared
a replacement for you.

268
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,722
THIS is the replacement?!

269
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:23,624
What's the matter,
Miss Ayuzawa?

270
00:15:23,724 --> 00:15:25,091
Uh, nothing, it's just‐

271
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,727
don't you think this is
a little too revealing?

272
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,128
What's that,
Miss Ayuzawa?

273
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:30,330
You accidentally burned
yourself in the shower?

274
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,497
HUH?!

275
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,034
And now, in an attempt
to conceal your injury,

276
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,301
you're being modest
to avoid discovery?

277
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,170
Uh, no, that's not
the problem.

278
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,205
Wait‐ now you're
saying you slipped and
sprained your ankle?

279
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,041
No, that's not it either‐

280
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,509
Okay‐ but you're
saying you've definitely
injured yourself

281
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,645
in some horrible fashion?
Are you even listening‐?

282
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:45,812
I'm coming in.

283
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,614
HUH?! Wait just a minute!

284
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,252
I‐I‐I'm okay!
I'm not injured at all!

285
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,055
Are you sure?
You seem rather flustered.

286
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,790
No, it's because the clothes
you gave me are embarassing!

287
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,592
You don't have to
lie about it.

288
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,993
It's not a lie!

289
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,028
Then show me.
Or I'm coming in.

290
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,897
O‐okay, I'll just put
these on real quick,

291
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,265
so just give me
a minute, okay?!

292
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,333
I'll give you
10 seconds.

293
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,135
Ten... Nine...

294
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:13,774
Eight... Seven...
Six... Five...

295
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:17,477
Four... Three...
He's counting down?!
What's his problem?!

296
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:19,713
Two... One...

297
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,248
And zero.

298
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:27,087
Give me my uniform right now!

299
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,323
(Laughing)

300
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,092
See?! I told you!
It looks weird!

301
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,760
And it's WAY
too revealing!

302
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,261
I think it suits you
pretty well‐

303
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,731
And you didn't have any
trouble getting it on, either!

304
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:40,066
I did it reflexively!

305
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,502
Anyway, I don't care
if it's dirty,

306
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:43,203
just hurry and
give my clothes back!

307
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,671
That would be a waste.

308
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:48,108
Besides, that outfit really
does look quite fetching.

309
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,177
In fact, it looks
rather natural on you.

310
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,113
Uh...

311
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,981
Maybe because...

312
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:57,183
it's what your used to?

313
00:16:57,918 --> 00:16:59,152
(Gasp)

314
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,054
How did he...?!

315
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,891
A woman who'd wear somethin'
like this to work

316
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,327
is lookin' for the wrong
sorta attention.

317
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,296
And you've really
caught my eye.

318
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,466
(Gasp)

319
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,236
Forget about it.

320
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,840
My guys are holdin' things
down outside.

321
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,843
Let's get things started...

322
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,310
Get your ass over here.

323
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,513
So this is who
you REALLY are.

324
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,949
I'll admit it,
you had me fooled.

325
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,483
I figured as much.

326
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,452
You don't seem like the
sharpest tool in the shed.

327
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:33,954
This guy's a
freakin' jerk!

328
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,488
To be honest,
I'm really disappointed

329
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,491
you of all people fell for
my lil' act so easily.

330
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:43,396
I thought you had more substance
to ya. Guess I was wrong.

331
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,331
You're a babe,
a student council president,

332
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,601
and a maid
all rolled into one.

333
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,071
I'm excited to see how you're
gonna fit in at Miyabigaoka,
Miss President.

334
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,906
Wait a minute!
You've got this all wrong!

335
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:55,008
Guess I've got no choice.

336
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,143
This'll do, right?!

337
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,813
If it isn't enough for ya,

338
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,082
then you gotta do somethin'
more interesting.

339
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,717
"More interesting"?

340
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,620
Being the heir to the Igarashi
Conglomerate has its perks.

341
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,490
I can get whatever girl
I want, whenever I want.

342
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,892
Uh...

343
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:16,162
But I'm getting' sick of
them meek, obedient types.

344
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,165
I was hopin' for a bit more
outta YOU, though.

345
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,936
But in the end you were
just in it for the money, too.

346
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,470
You're just like
the rest of'em.

347
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:29,576
Meanin' as far as girls go,
you're completely worthless.

348
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:32,478
Hmph. You're one
pathetic excuse for a man.

349
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,747
Huh?

350
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,882
Have you always looked down
on people like this?

351
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,085
If you honestly believe
that everyone around you
is "worthless,"

352
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,622
then that's your
own fault, isn't it?

353
00:18:41,722 --> 00:18:45,692
There's not a single
person in this world
who's worthless!

354
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:52,599
The reason I came here today
was to tell you one thing,
and one thing only:

355
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,968
I refuse your invitation
to Miyabigaoka!

356
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:00,574
I have no intention of giving up
my position as Seika's
Student Council President!

357
00:19:01,742 --> 00:19:03,376
(Evil chuckle)

358
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,714
You really are...
an interestin' girl, aren't ya?

359
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,183
(Struggling)

360
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,585
Nice try.

361
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,521
You may do aikido,
but I do judo.

362
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,823
My groundwork is
my specialty.

363
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:19,726
Ah! No... Stop!

364
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,605
U... sui...!

365
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,176
Yeah. I think that's enough.

366
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,278
(Gasp)

367
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,047
What about my guys...?

368
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,617
They wouldn't let me in,
so I had to be a little mean.

369
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:45,986
(Groaning)

370
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,954
Sorry 'bout that!

371
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:51,424
Still, it looks like
you're the one who's
being really mean.

372
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,527
Right, you
perverted man‐child?

373
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,029
You've got some balls
talkin' to me like that.

374
00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:00,867
Whatever.
Unfortunately, you're
going to have to find
someone else to harass.

375
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:06,172
You can't just touch her
whenever you want.

376
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,274
So keep your hands
to yourself.

377
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,776
Look who's talking!

378
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,680
Well, that's that.
Shall we go, Miss President?

379
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,315
Hey, wait!

380
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,721
Mr. Igarashi...

381
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,590
If you have anything to discuss,
I will speak with you
at your convenience...

382
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,727
as Student Council President
of Seika High.

383
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,665
Huh...

384
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:36,870
Usui! What are
you doing here?

385
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,574
I came to save a
certain someone from
a bad situation. Also...

386
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,276
You called for me
didn't you?

387
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:45,211
Wh‐what are you talking about?!

388
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,948
D‐don't be stupid‐
of course I didn't!

389
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,754
I have no intention of
giving up my position

390
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:56,557
as Seika's Student
Council President!

391
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,894
Even so...
good job back there.

392
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,863
(Gasp)

393
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,500
Here we go again.

394
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,271
Usui...

395
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,474
Uh... Thank you. Again.

396
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,882
Oh. I just happened
to pick these up...

397
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,851
Would you like a fancy
Miyabigaoka uniform

398
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,254
or the same old Seika High
one you're use to?
Well, which one?

399
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,056
Just gimme my old one!

400
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,825
Yet she took both anyway!

401
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,064
Huh?

402
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,268
Miss President!

403
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,037
Master!

404
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,343
What're you guys doing...?

405
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:51,845
Misaki...

406
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:53,213
Misaki!

407
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,849
I flat‐out refused
their offer to transfer.

408
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:57,450
I'm not going anywhere.

409
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,686
Ah, thank goodness!

410
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,721
Welcome back!

411
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:01,755
Master!

412
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:03,824
[THREE IDIOTS]
What's Usui doing here?!

413
00:22:03,924 --> 00:22:05,859
(Misaki laughing)

414
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:16,036
She really is an
interesting woman, isn't she.

415
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:18,104
(Evil chuckle)

416
00:23:50,797 --> 00:23:53,967
[USUI]
Miss President, I was the
only one whose name you
called in that scene.

417
00:23:54,067 --> 00:23:56,703
[MISAKI]
Shut it, Usui!
You were just hearing things!

418
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,238
[USUI]
Well, I heard it
pretty clearly...

419
00:23:58,338 --> 00:23:59,740
[MISAKI]
Where the heck were you anyway?

420
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,207
There's no way you could've
heard me talk that softly.

421
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,909
[USUI]
There, you see?

422
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:05,579
[MISAKI]
Huh? Sakura and Yukimura?
Why are you dressed like that?

423
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,881
[SAKURA]
I reckon we'll have some
mighty fine weather today.

424
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:10,216
[YUKIMURA]
Reckon I brought back
a big ol' peach!

425
00:24:10,316 --> 00:24:11,585
[SAKURA]
Ah! I love peaches!

426
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,253
[MISAKI]
I am a native of these parts...

427
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:15,522
[SAKURA]
Reckon we'll be sittin' down
to eat us some peach!

428
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,823
[MISAKI]
Looks like I'll
have to bring

429
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,793
some friends to
slay these demons!
