00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:43,069
[Usui, narrating]
Once upon a time, there lived
an old man and an old woman.

2
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,371
Reckon we'll be havin'
some good weather today!

3
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:49,743
[Usui, narrating]
One day, Old Woman Sakura
went down to the river
to wash laundry,

4
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:54,414
and Old Man Yukimura,
rather than going to the
forest to gather firewood,

5
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,750
Huh?
was made to help.

6
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,286
[Usui, narrating]
Just then, a giant peach
came floating down the river.

7
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,722
Wouldja lookie here!

8
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,923
W‐wait up!

9
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:06,827
Aah! I love me
some peaches!

10
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,129
[Usui, narrating]
The old man and the old woman
carried the peach home...

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,430
Glint!

12
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,099
[Usui, narrating]
and prepared to eat it.

13
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,000
(Slice)

14
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,435
Just then...

15
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,173
Ahh! Oh!

16
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,442
[Usui, narrating]
out from the peach, came:

17
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,611
Ta‐daa!

18
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:34,487
I‐I shall go forward and
slay the demons! Yes, indeed!

19
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,156
Uhh...

20
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,861
D‐Dear, look! A person came
outta that there peach!

21
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,630
Hey, this ain't no time
for face‐stuffin'!

22
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,299
Lately, a band of demons has
been stealing away young maidens

23
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,969
and terrorizing villages
left and right, have they not?

24
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,940
[SAKURA]
Oh, my. The peach done born a
splendid young boy. Munch munch.

25
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,245
I guess it's up to me to
slay these wicked demons!
Yes, indeed!

26
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,881
[SAKURA]
Now now, Momotaro.

27
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,651
It's nothin' you need to be
getting' all worked up over.

28
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,186
O‐oh really?

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,423
"Momotaro"?
Dear, you already
thought up a name for him?

30
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,159
I must now go forth
and defeat the demons.

31
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,228
Ooh, aren't you
a handsome one.

32
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,531
Here, reckon you should
take these with you.

33
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,366
We made you
plenty of dumplings,
so be sure to eat up!

34
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,168
Thank you very much,
old woman.

35
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,037
Bye! Take care!

36
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,873
Do yer best, y'hear?!

37
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,275
What was that all about?

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,078
Who knows. Let's go eat
some more peach.

39
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:36,983
[Usui, narrating]
And so, Momotaro set off
to defeat the demons...

40
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,288
[Usui, narrating]
and came upon a dog,
a monkey, and a pheasant.

41
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,757
Why did this happen to us?!

42
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,291
It's your fault, Dog!
You let that guy trick you!

43
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,960
He tricked YOU,
too, Monkey!

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,895
It's Pheasant's fault for not
noticing in the first place!

45
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,532
Hey, I'm the one who
said it was suspicious
in the first place!

46
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,668
What are you idiots
doing up there?

47
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,470
Huh? You there! Stranger!

48
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,639
HELP US!

49
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,941
A bad man tricked us and
now he's gonna kill us!

50
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,276
(Sigh)

51
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,380
[Usui, narrating]
The three said that if
Momotaro helped them,

52
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,417
they would do
anything he wished.

53
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,386
[Usui, narrating]
But... they tried to
steal his dumplings,

54
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,589
so he beat the crap out of them.

55
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,360
[Usui]
That's why I tied them up
in the first place.

56
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,134
Ah! It's him!
It's the bad man!

57
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,469
We're gonna die!

58
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,337
Who might you be?

59
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,074
I am Usui.

60
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:38,411
I'm the leader of the
Three Idiot Circus.
Those are my men.

61
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,881
There's no way
that's true!

62
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,186
Uh... I went to the trouble
of forming a circus,

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,354
but those three are
completely useless.

64
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,191
So I was thinking I should
just eat them instead.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,559
I see.

66
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,360
Well, if you're killing
them for food,

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,529
I guess that's reasonable.

68
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,763
It's not reasonable at all!

69
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,331
All they ever do is practice,

70
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,900
and because of that,
we're out of food...

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,768
You call that "practice"?!
All you do is hit us with a whip

72
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,937
and cackle like you're
having the time of your life!

73
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,839
Now then...
AH!

74
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,207
Who wants to go first?

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,842
I'm not tasty at all!

76
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:09,910
This guy's delicious!

77
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,311
I'm telling you,
THIS guy is!

78
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,213
Yeah, this guy's the
tastiest of us all!

79
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,414
Don't put me in, damnit!

80
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,716
Wait a moment.

81
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,483
You're going to
save us after all?!

82
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,753
I want to ask you one thing
before you get eaten.

83
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,487
You're not gonna
help us at all...

84
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:24,190
Do you know where the demons
that plague this land live?

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,959
We don't know at all...

86
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,561
I see.

87
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,564
Usui, I suggest putting all
three into a nice, hot stew.

88
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,132
I guess I'll be
on my way then.

89
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,835
[THREE IDIOTS]
Ah! Wait, wait, wait!

90
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:39,305
We don't know where the demons
are, but we know a village
where they were seen recently!

91
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,607
Uh?

92
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,408
It's a village with
a lotta youngsters.

93
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,177
One day the demons
suddenly showed up

94
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,648
and apparently the next
morning all the girls
had up and vanished.

95
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,415
Where might I find
this village?!

96
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,452
We won't tell you
unless you help us.

97
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,621
(Sigh)

98
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,157
Usui...

99
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,892
Very well.

100
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,995
But in exchange...

101
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,997
Give me those dumplings.

102
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,700
[Usui, narrating]
Thus, Momotaro set out,

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,335
accompanied by a dog,
a monkey, a pheasant

104
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,405
and the blatantly suspicious
leader of a circus troupe,
to find the demons.

105
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,908
[KUROSAKI]
What about OUR share
of the dumplings?

106
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,142
I ate it all.

107
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,310
NO WAY!

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,980
B‐but still,
this is kinda fun, huh?

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,383
A party led by a brave warrior,
setting out to defeat
a terrible enemy...

110
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,919
A "party"?

111
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,154
What do you think this is?!
A holiday vacation?!

112
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,157
We're not going on this journey
so you party animals
can have a good time!

113
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,659
[SARASHINA]
Not that kinda "party"!

114
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,829
I mean the five of us together
as a group, with a name!

115
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,900
I suppose a name
would be helpful...

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,101
How about...

117
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,836
The Party to Defeat the Demons!

118
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,571
Or "The Demon‐Defeating Party"
for short!

119
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,306
A fine name, is it not?

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,042
No objections?
Well then, let us continue!

121
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,484
Is this it...?

122
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,855
So this is where those
poor girls were kidnapped.

123
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,725
The village is
in shambles...

124
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,694
it looks like it's been
completely abandoned.

125
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,731
I'm tellin ya,
that one's all mine!

126
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,198
Tryin' to steal now,
are ya?

127
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,467
That's from my field and
you know it, you damn thief!

128
00:07:14,568 --> 00:07:16,737
NUH‐UH!
This one's from MY field!

129
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,674
Uh, excuse me, sirs...

130
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:21,775
The hell do you want‐

131
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,076
Got it!

132
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:25,946
Get back here, you!

133
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:29,149
Are things like this
because of... the demons?

134
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,685
That stinks!

135
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,286
AH!

136
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,788
Where the heck's he going?!

137
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,390
He said, "it stinks" or
something and suddenly took off.

138
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,960
He is a dog after all‐
his nose is sensitive.

139
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,564
If y'all can't even
handle a smell like that,

140
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:46,667
then you'd better hurry
and get outta this village
while you still can.

141
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,502
Tell us what happened here!

142
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:52,038
This village ain't a place
that normal people
can live in no more

143
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,542
it's gotten too bad
for... Ughhhh

144
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:00,046
Hey! What's wrong?
Are you all‐!

145
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,583
Ah. Looks like he just
couldn't take it anymore...

146
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:05,085
Somebody please tell us
what's going on!

147
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,452
It's cuz of the women.

148
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,321
When they disappeared
things went downhill fast.

149
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,057
With no one around to take care
of the washin' or cleanin',

150
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,226
things started getting'
really out of hand.

151
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,228
We don't know how to do
any of that crap,

152
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,032
so we've more or less
gone into survival mode.

153
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,035
It's turned into
a total war zone!

154
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:25,506
Actually, it's kinda
fun not having any
rules to follow.

155
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,574
We can do whatever we want!

156
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,211
Do you really think the women
will be happy when they return

157
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,847
to find that this place has
turned into a total pig‐sty?!

158
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,016
It's not like they're
actually coming back right?

159
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:38,051
Those guys that
took'em are DEMONS.

160
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,520
We don't stand
a chance.

161
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,420
Right?

162
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,387
I know, right?

163
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,889
Quit screwing around!

164
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,158
We're gonna save your women
whether you like it or not!

165
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,662
Now hurry and tell us
where the demons are, damnit!

166
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,098
Sure is peaceful, huh?

167
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,540
So "Demon Island" is on the
other side of this ocean, huh?

168
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,675
I don't see anything
but the horizon.

169
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,844
Can we really trust
those villagers?

170
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,712
They REALLY didn't
wanna help us!

171
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,848
It's like they didn't
even care if we died!

172
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,284
It seemed like they were
just trying to hurry
and get rid of us.

173
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:12,953
Let's not go.

174
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,788
Yeah, let's at least
wait another day or two.

175
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,523
We might find some
more reliable info
at a different village.

176
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,724
All right.
Huh?

177
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,825
[MISAKI]
Let's move out!

178
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,661
He just won't listen!

179
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,995
Check out
this turtle!

180
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,697
Let's flip it
on its back!

181
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,398
Ha, ha!
Take that!

182
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:27,200
Hey! Cut that out!

183
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,035
What're you doing?!

184
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,370
Run away!

185
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,572
He saved that turtle!

186
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,507
Wait, I've heard
about this before!

187
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,108
Heard about what, Monkey?

188
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,711
I heard it from a guy who
heard it from another guy!

189
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:40,814
If you help a turtle out
it'll reward your kindness by
letting you ride on its shell

190
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,318
to the bottom of the ocean
to party at the Dragon King's
underwater palace.

191
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,353
What's the Dragon King's
palace like?

192
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,389
It's an awesome place
where a sexy princess

193
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,892
gives you all the
fresh seafood you can eat!

194
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,394
Tuna, flounder, crab‐
you name it!

195
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,297
And she gives you a really
special souvenir when you leave!

196
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,633
Really?! Do you think
that turtle will take us?!

197
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,101
But there's a catch!

198
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,637
You absolutely can't
open the gift at all!

199
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,305
If you get too nosy
and try and open it...

200
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,774
smoke will come out and
before you know it...

201
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,811
Poof! You'll be transformed
into a wrinkly old man

202
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,813
with a long beard
and everything!

203
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:14,581
What the heck kinda
reward is that?

204
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,282
Are you sure that turtle
is saying thanks?!

205
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,785
Wait, I've got it!
All you have to do is
not open the box, right?

206
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,589
Exactly. If you don't
open the box, you get
to eat delicious food

207
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,559
and spend some quality
time with a royal babe!

208
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,993
Hey, you idiots.

209
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,195
What do you think you're
whispering about over there?

210
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,430
Oh!

211
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,265
N‐nothing at all!

212
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,134
We were just discussing how
we were gonna ride this turtle

213
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,302
on over to Demon Island
to scout ahead.

214
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,605
We're gonna make sure those
villagers' story checks out!

215
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,406
See you later!

216
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:44,911
I think they're trying
to make this into a
different story.

217
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,681
Does it really matter?

218
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:54,921
(Splash)

219
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,122
[SHIROKAWA]
I can't breathe!

220
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,824
[SARASHINA]
You tryin' to kill me?!

221
00:10:57,924 --> 00:10:59,392
[KUROSAKI]
I can't swim!

222
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,696
[SHIROKAWA]
Are you sure this boat's okay?!

223
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,397
[KUROSAKI]
What if we get
shipwrecked or somethin'?

224
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,099
We don't have
any food to eat!

225
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,668
Then I guess we'll just have
to eat the three of you.

226
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:08,769
Ah!

227
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,203
I knew it!

228
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,372
Pheasant! Hurry up and
go find Demon Island

229
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,640
before we get eaten!

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,041
Roger!

231
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,881
[SHIROKAWA]
I don't see any land...

232
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,749
[SARASHINA]
And the stupid pheasant
hasn't come back yet.

233
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,450
He obviously
abandoned you.

234
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,385
Huh?

235
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:26,720
Our bond is unbreakable!

236
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,188
You were ready to
sell each other out

237
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,023
when it looked like
you'd be eaten.

238
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,325
No, it can't be!
He left us!

239
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,462
He forgot all about us
and saved himself!

240
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm hungry.

241
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,702
Me, too.

242
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,136
Oh.

243
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:47,373
Looks like I had
one left after all.

244
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,208
It's mine!

245
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,242
Let go!

246
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,080
Huh?

247
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,916
Aaagh!

248
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,459
Which one of these did you drop?

249
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,662
Was it this single,
tiny dumpling?

250
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:13,499
Or was it this stack of entry
cards for a sweepstakes to win
a year's supply of dumplings?

251
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,838
Or perhaps it was...
this winning entry card for a
Hokkaido Bounty of the Sea set

252
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,007
containing the highest quality
crab, sea urchin, salmon roe,
and scallops?

253
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,547
Uh... just the
normal dumpling.

254
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,983
I see. Yes.
You are indeed truthful.

255
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,652
For your honesty,
I shall instead give you

256
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,388
this winning entry card for the
Hokkaido Bounty of the Sea Set.

257
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,592
Where's a post office?

258
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:42,195
A village by the sea, about 30
miles north‐northwest of here.

259
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,764
When will we get it?

260
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:45,131
The drawing will be held
in one month,

261
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,101
and the winner
notified by mail...

262
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,974
She ran off.

263
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,042
Give us back that dumpling!

264
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,844
What in tarnation
are y'all eatin'?

265
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,080
Ah! Hey there,
Old Lady Shizuko!

266
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,849
We're havin' ourselves
some peach!

267
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,474
President... you asleep?

268
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:32,513
I you want to sleep,
I can stay awake for you...

269
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,448
So, no then...

270
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,250
Don't touch me.

271
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,752
Keep your distance.

272
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,320
The four of us may be
travelling together,

273
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,023
but I don't trust any of you
farther than I can throw you.

274
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,326
Especially YOU, Usui.
You're WAY too suspicious!

275
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,595
I'm not falling for that
circus leader act!

276
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:52,465
Okay then.
Do whatever you
want, I guess.

277
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,301
[KUROSAKI]
Heeeey! Heeeey!

278
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,103
Ah. Isn't that
the pheasant?

279
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:57,971
Hey!

280
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,541
Ah! He came back for us!

281
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:02,643
Help me! Help me!

282
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:06,479
Huh? It looks like he's
got some kinda rope
around him or something.

283
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,050
OH!

284
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:12,586
Help me!

285
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:19,425
Help me!
They're gonna kill me!
Help me! Help me!

286
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:23,363
Oh look! He must've fallen
and been taken by that
lovely ship.

287
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,431
That was awfully
thoughtful of them.

288
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,168
[IGARASHI]
Well, well. Are those
your "friends" down there

289
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,236
in that piss‐poor
lookin' boat?

290
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,371
What a letdown.

291
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,439
Well since you don't
have nothin' to steal

292
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,143
I guess we're gonna have to find
another way to keep ourselves
entertained.

293
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,712
Oh!

294
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,447
How about...
You beg for your lives!

295
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,718
You stupid bird!
Why'd you get
captured by pirates?!

296
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:45,852
And you lead them
right to us!

297
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,320
Traitors!

298
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,194
Another turtle?!

299
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,361
Is that the same one as before?

300
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,096
Does that mean...?

301
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,664
We're getting a reward?!

302
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:04,470
If you promise not to
peek inside, I'll give
you a present, okay?

303
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,072
O‐okay!

304
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,477
No we can't look!

305
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,580
I bet it's another trick
to see if we're honest!

306
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,450
Is it just me or does it
seem like the story's
getting messed up again?

307
00:15:17,551 --> 00:15:19,119
Does it really matter?

308
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,655
Huh?

309
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,465
I wonder what she's doing...

310
00:15:33,534 --> 00:15:35,636
There's some strange guy
sleepin' in there!

311
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:36,469
Who the heck is he?!

312
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,905
Get outta here!

313
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,541
You bastards think you
can just ignore me

314
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,176
for some crappy mini‐story?
Well ignore THIS!

315
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,411
Goodness gracious,
that's a whole lotta peach.

316
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,580
Ain't it though?

317
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,049
Reckon we got lots more.
So go on and eat up!

318
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,984
N‐no more, please.

319
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,520
I've had enough of this.

320
00:15:57,758 --> 00:16:01,161
Well. Cut my bullet
clean in half, didn't ya?

321
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,634
Interesting.
How 'bout you come up here?

322
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:11,271
C'mon! Don't keep me waitin'!

323
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,345
Guess I've got no choice, huh?

324
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,849
(Scared)

325
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,484
Wait, wait, don't
use that thing!
Where the heck did
that even come from?!

326
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:27,120
You should probably
cover your ears.

327
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,089
Huh?

328
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,830
[CREWMAN]
Ah! The ship's on fire!

329
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,864
Uh...

330
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,533
(Crew screaming)

331
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,935
[Kurosaki]
AHHH! IT'S HOT!
Somebody help me already!

332
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,804
[Usui]
I think we'd better
clear some distance.

333
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:45,506
[MISAKI]
Good idea.

334
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,275
Hmph. Those guys sure
are interesting.

335
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,718
Oh... Thank you.

336
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,353
It's no problem.

337
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:06,760
Still...
It's already morning, huh?
I'm so tired.

338
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,295
(Yawn)

339
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh. Look.

340
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,503
Hm?

341
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,372
Looks like we've finally
reached our destination.

342
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:21,775
Demon Island!

343
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,281
Hey! Do we really stand a
chance against these guys?

344
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,617
We didn't even bring any
weapons with us, man!

345
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,187
Oh! I know exactly what to do
in a situation like this!

346
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,956
Run away and
never come back?

347
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:38,024
Ta‐daa!

348
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:39,359
A piece of straw?

349
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,861
With this we'll be able
to trade around

350
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,195
for a bunch of
different things.

351
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,597
If we trade it enough times

352
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:45,498
we'll end up with a
super powerful weapon!

353
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,700
Really?!

354
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,635
All right! Do you have
anything to trade, Pheasant?

355
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,670
Yeah!

356
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,171
Ta‐daa!

357
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:52,739
Okay! And you, Dog!

358
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,740
Yeah!

359
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,208
Ta‐daa!

360
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,043
All right,
anything else?

361
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,112
The only weapon we need...

362
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,781
is THIS right here!

363
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,182
We'll take them head‐on!

364
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,818
President, President.
Have a look at this.

365
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:06,987
I get it.

366
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,522
If we disguise ourselves
with these,

367
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,223
we'll be able to infiltrate
the demon hideout

368
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,858
and catch them off‐guard.

369
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,427
Anyway, sneaking in instead
of storming the place

370
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:16,997
will also put the women
in much less danger.

371
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,433
Of course, this could just be
some sort of enemy trap.

372
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:22,769
But this is our only
option, so let's go!

373
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,170
Then the three of us...

374
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,972
We'll go check things out
in our realistic forms.

375
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,841
We'll blend in to
our surroundings.

376
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,244
Woof woof.
Screech screech.
Ooo aaa.

377
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,780
[KUROSAKI]
And if it looks
like we're screwed,
we'll sneak out of here.

378
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,481
[SHIROKAWA]
How's it look?

379
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:39,920
Huh?

380
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,722
Th‐this is...!

381
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,356
Huh?

382
00:18:48,028 --> 00:18:50,296
[SHIROKAWA]
It's paradise!

383
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:54,500
It's a maid harem!

384
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,840
Don't forget what we're
here for, you three idiots!

385
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,107
Huh?

386
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,676
Let's hurry and get
these girls to safety

387
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:03,877
before the demons find us!

388
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,078
Huh? What's going on?

389
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,547
I guess she's
a new girl?

390
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,314
[THREE IDIOTS]
S‐so that means...

391
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:12,085
You're really a GIRL?!

392
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,620
I'm leaving
these fools here.

393
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,089
Damnit, where the hell
did Usui run off to?

394
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,224
I'm right here.

395
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,800
Welcome back home...
Master Usui.

396
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,570
Uh...

397
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,875
Uh...

398
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,849
Usui... You...

399
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,184
What trickery is this?!

400
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,953
Hm? Did I not mention
I was a demon?

401
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,990
But I really am the leader
of Three Idiots Circus.

402
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,658
Shut up! I don't care
about that crap!

403
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,028
It was you who kidnapped these
young maidens, wasn't it?

404
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:58,331
Prepare to die,
you perverted demon!

405
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,134
Hold it right there, missy‐
you've got it all wrong.

406
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:02,035
Huh?

407
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:03,169
We weren't kidnapped‐

408
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,071
we came here
because we wanted to!

409
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,439
HUH?!

410
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,108
We just couldn't bear
to spend another minute

411
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,375
in that filthy village.

412
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,545
All the guys were pigs.
It sucked.

413
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,414
[HONOKA
When Mr. Usui showed up
we knew we had to follow him.

414
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:16,382
[SATSUKI]
This island is like
a dream come true!

415
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,519
[SUBARU]
It's cozy AND
well‐maintained!

416
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,521
[ERIKA]
Yeah, we're way happier here.

417
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,289
Basically, these women have
completely taken over my home,

418
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,891
and I can't get rid of them.

419
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,561
Oh, poor, poor, pitiful me.

420
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,931
So...

421
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,902
Why don't we date,
Miss President?

422
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,972
Let's leave this island
and go someplace fun.

423
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,541
How bout it?

424
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,108
Wh...

425
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,244
Why would I date
someone like you‐

426
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,780
Ooh!
Cutesy flowers!

427
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,181
"Why"?

428
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,716
Because...

429
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,520
Because when I'm
with you I feel alive.

430
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,921
Ah...

431
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,591
[Usui, narrating]
Thus, the two of them
became lovers, and‐

432
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,927
H‐hey hold on a minute!
You've got it all wrong!

433
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,296
Th‐this guy's just
some perverted freak,
I wouldn't go out with him.

434
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,900
Also, that outfit's
rather revealing.
Are you trying to seduce me?

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,434
I'm not!

436
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:10,136
I didn't want it to be in the
way so I cut the hem short.

437
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,305
Hey, cut that out!
Let go of me!

438
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:13,540
[Usui, narrating]
And the two of them set off
on a new adventure.

439
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,609
But that's another story.

440
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,278
The end.

441
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:26,219
Quit it...
don't touch me...
pervert!

442
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,788
Mr. Usui...

443
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:30,657
what exactly have you
been making her listen to?

444
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,826
She sounds like she's
having a nightmare...

445
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:36,863
A special bedtime story
made by me.

446
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,331
[Usui, narrating]
Incidentally, The Three Idiots

447
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,433
ended up becoming
food after all.

448
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:42,402
But that, too, is another story.

449
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:45,005
We get treated like food
right up till the very end?

450
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:46,072
I don't wanna get eaten!

451
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:47,407
What a cruel way to go!

452
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,942
[Usui, narrating]
Fine, then The Three Idiots

453
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,745
ended up making it out
alive and in one piece.

454
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,881
(Bark)

455
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,283
[Usui, narrating]
The dog became the pet
of Old Man Hanasaka

456
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,219
and was renamed "Pochi."

457
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,088
But...

458
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,692
[Usui, narrating]
The pheasant ate some of
the old woman's starch...

459
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,327
(Evil laugh)

460
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:11,932
[Usui, narrating]
And the monkey tricked a crab
to steal its rice ball...

461
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,402
Don't kill us!

462
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,872
[Usui, narrating]
The end, I guess.

463
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:53,634
[MISAKI]
I really don't like having my
dreams controlled by YOU, Usui.

464
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,769
[USUI]
But, ma'am, you're the
adventurous type.

465
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,170
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

466
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,405
[MISAKI]
When have I ever said
I'm adventurous?!

467
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,207
[SAKURA]
Misaki! Listen, listen!

468
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:04,545
[MISAKI]
What is it, Sakura?
You're more hyped up than usual.

469
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,179
[SAKURA]
There's this SUPER dreamy band!

470
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,548
You think so too,
right, Shizuko?!

471
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,315
[SHIZUKO]
No. I have no interest
whatsoever.

472
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,251
[SAKURA]
Let's throw an awesome party!

473
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,720
[SHIZUKO]
It looks like we'll be spending
time with the band members.

474
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,589
[MISAKI]
What was that? The band members?

475
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:18,625
[USUI]
Yeah, the band members.
Didn't you know?
