1
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,333
[YUKIMURA]
My name is Shouichirou Yukimura.
And this...

2
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,603
[YUKIMURA]
...is my younger sister, Ruri.

3
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:48,074
[YUKIMURA]
Her dream is to find her prince
charming and marry him to become
a beautiful princess.

4
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,511
(RURI giggles)

5
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,718
Hey, are you even
listening to me, Kanou?

6
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:01,154
Yeah, you were saying that
someone has been picking on
you again, Yukimura.

7
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,191
[YUKIMURA] Recently things
have just been getting worse
and worse.
[KANOU] With who exactly?

8
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,828
[YUKIMURA] (sigh)
[RURI] You'll never catch me!
[BOY A] Hey, wait up!

9
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:10,330
[YUKIMURA] Actually, my younger
sis‐ Ah! Ow...
[BOY A] I said wait, Yukimura!

10
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,367
[KANOU] Yukimura?
[GIRL A] We're supposed to be
playing Princess, but this is
just Tag!

11
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,002
[BOY B]
Ruri, wait!

12
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:16,903
[YUKIMURA]
Ruri!

13
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,004
[RURI]
Huh?

14
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,072
[BOY A]
You know him?

15
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,406
[BOY B]
Who is that?

16
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,142
[YUKIMURA]
Hi there, everyone. I'm Ruri's‐

17
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,944
[RURI]
He's some boy from the
neighborhood.

18
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,178
(YUKIMURA sighs)

19
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,814
[RURI]
Sorry, but I have to
go home now.

20
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,282
[GIRL A]
Aw? But how come?

21
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,051
[BOY B]
What about the Princess Game?

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,619
[RURI]
We can play some more tomorrow.

23
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,688
(YUKIMURA dead inside)
[RURI] Bye‐bye. See you later!

24
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,389
[KIDS]
Bye‐bye!

25
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,361
[YUKIMURA]
I'm not "some boy," I'm you're
big brother! (crying)

26
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,630
[RURI]
That's cuz I was playing the
Princess Game.

27
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,568
A princess's big brother has
gotta be more like a prince, or
else it'll ruin the whole game!

28
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,402
[YUKIMURA]
(sobbing) How can you say that?!

29
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,573
[MISAKI]
Huh? What are you doing?
Who's that little girl?

30
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:57,678
[KANOU]
Um... it would appear she's
Yukimura's younger sister.

31
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,047
(lovestruck)

32
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:06,419
[MISAKI]
His sister? She's so cute! She
looks just like you, Yukimura!

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,288
[RURI] ...rince...
[YUKIMURA] Huh?

34
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,455
[RURI]
You're Ruri's...

35
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,457
[RURI]
Prince charming!

36
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,062
It's settled! I'm gonna marry
this prince and be his bride!

37
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,864
[ALL]
(shocked) Hah?!

38
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,034
[MISAKI] So... she wants to go
on a date with Usui?
[USUI] Lick, lick...

39
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,236
[YUKIMURA]
She begged me all last night.

40
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,873
Are you an idiot?! What kind of
brother would hand his younger
sister to a pervert like this?!

41
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,811
[YUKIMURA] Ehhh?!
[MISAKI] And why are you eating
in the student council room?!
Snacks are prohibited!

42
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,345
[USUI]
What? It's just candy.

43
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,615
You gave it to me yesterday
at Maid Latte, remember‐?

44
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,182
[MISAKI]
No one asked you about that!

45
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,918
[MISAKI]
In any case, I
absolutely forbid it!

46
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,854
[YUKIMURA]
But Miss President! Last night
...my sister...

47
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:43,023
called me "awesome" for
the very first time!

48
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,292
(YUKIMURA happy giggles)
[RURI] Big Brother, you're
the best! You're so awesome!

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,730
[YUKIMURA]
She said being friends with
a prince like that made me
awesome.

50
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,298
[YUKIMURA] So please...?
[MISAKI] The first time...? Ah?!

51
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,100
[YUKIMURA]
Please, Mr. Usui,
I'm begging you!

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,970
Ruri will finally accept me
as her big brother! PLEASE!
You have to!

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,773
[YUKIMURA]
I remember when Ruri was little
we spoiled her rotten!

54
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:02,876
My family's treated her like
a princess since she was born!

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,313
Whenever we played together,
she was always the princess and
I was always her prince!

56
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,951
[YUKIMURA]
But now that she's older she
doesn't want me to be her prince
anymore.

57
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,854
[MISAKI]
Well... I'm not sure you can
really do anything about that...

58
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,923
[YUKIMURA]
Don't say that! I have to do
something to win her back!

59
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,224
[USUI]
You spoil her too much.

60
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,593
[YUKIMURA]
I know, but please!

61
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,394
[YUKIMURA]
This might help me
regain my honor

62
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,797
not only as a big brother,
but as a man!

63
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,898
[YUKIMURA]
That's why...!

64
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,299
[YUKIMURA]
I'M BEGGING YOU!

65
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,635
[MISAKI]
Yukimura... You really...!

66
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,436
[USUI]
I have a bad feeling about this.

67
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,239
[MISAKI]
Yukimura! I had no idea how
strongly you felt!

68
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,376
To think you could get so
emotional for the sake of your
little sister!

69
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,645
[YUKIMURA] Miss President!
[MISAKI] I'm so moved!

70
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:42,282
[MISAKI]
All right! We'll work our
hardest to get back your status
as older brother!

71
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,652
[YUKIMURA] Thank you
very much, ma'am!
[MISAKI] You hear that Usui?

72
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,021
[MISAKI]
It's all up to you, Prince
Charming! Do your best!

73
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:52,693
Didn't you just call me a
"pervert" like 5 minutes ago?

74
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:56,129
[MISAKI]
That's right‐ you want your
sister to rely on you more than
anyone else, right, Yukimura?

75
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,965
[YUKIMURA] Yes, ma'am!
[MISAKI] Okay, then
give it your all!

76
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,601
[YUKIMURA]
Yes, Miss President!

77
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,671
[USUI]
Like I could ever say "no."

78
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,509
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
The day of the date. Wheee...

79
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,478
[YUKIMURA]
Are you sure it's okay for us to
leave her on her own till Mr.
Usui gets here?

80
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,347
[MISAKI]
Just calm down, Yukimura.

81
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,751
We have to try to stay hidden or
else we'll just get in Usui's
way, right?

82
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,553
[YUKIMURA]
Oh, yeah, that's right.

83
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,121
[YUKIMURA]
I'm sorry about this, Kanou.

84
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,156
We were supposed to go do
something, but now we're just...

85
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,726
[KANOU] It's fine.
[MISAKI] What were you
two going to do, anyway?

86
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,062
(RURI humming to herself)

87
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,336
[RURI] Prince Takumi!
[MISAKI & KANOU]
"Prince Takumi"?!

88
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:39,640
[YUKIMURA]
Sorry, she's been calling
him that ever since she
learned his name.

89
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,708
[MISAKI]
Those clothes are so
embarrassing...

90
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,645
[YUKIMURA]
Really? I think he looks like a
real prince!

91
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,747
[MISAKI]
Just who did he borrow
those from?

92
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,684
[AOI] From me of course.
Got a problem with that?
[MISAKI] Aoi?!

93
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:52,418
[YUKIMURA]
Is this gentleman a friend of
yours, ma'am?

94
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,621
[MISAKI] Uh, yeah, that's right!
[YUKIMURA] Uh?

95
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,958
[MISAKI] What are
you doing here?!
[AOI] I told you I ran into that
guy at the shop yesterday.

96
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,694
[SATSUKI] Eeek! Eeek! What are
you talking about?!
[AOI] He told me he needed a
"costume fit for a prince."

97
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,796
[SATSUKI]
Usui, thanks again for coming in
to work today!

98
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,498
[AOI]
So I had no choice but to make
him the ULTIMATE prince costume!

99
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,702
[AOI]
I even had to sacrifice one of
my days off‐ it was a huge pain,
really.

100
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,370
[MISAKI]
Yeah, you look real broken up
about it...

101
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,872
[RURI]
Yaay!

102
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,840
[RURI]
Prince Takumi! Prince Takumi!

103
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,276
Prince Takumi! Prince Takumi!
Prince Takumi!

104
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,245
Prince Takumi! Prince Takumi...
(giggles)

105
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,516
[RURI] Uh?
[MISAKI] He face‐palmed her!

106
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,986
[USUI]
What do you wish to do today,
Princess?

107
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,420
[RURI]
Hm... Flowers!

108
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,856
I decree we go where
there's lotsa flowers!

109
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,859
[MISAKI'S GHOST]
"I decree" sure makes her sound
like a princess, huh?

110
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,095
[MISAKI]
He took her to the
botanical gardens?

111
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:39,586
[AOI]
That guy sure took on one
huge pain in the butt of
an assignment.

112
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:40,520
[AOI]
Huh?

113
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,522
[AOI]
He's looking over here.

114
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,094
[KANOU]
Did anyone else notice that
there are flowers springing up
out of nowhere?

115
00:06:48,194 --> 00:06:49,462
[YUKIMURA]
Don't worry I saw it, too.

116
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,331
[AOI]
What the heck is he doing?

117
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,433
[AOI]
He's REALLY looking
in this direction.

118
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,368
[MISAKI]
Yeah... he's REALLY looking.

119
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:58,137
[AOI]
Are you jealous that you're not
the one on a date with him
instead?

120
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:01,441
[AOI] Jeez, you guys really are
an idiot couple aren't you?
[MISAKI] No, we're not a
couple!

121
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,142
[AOI]
Well, HE obviously wants to be.

122
00:07:03,242 --> 00:07:04,377
[MISAKI]
No, you've got it wrong!

123
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,778
[RURI]
Prince Takumi!

124
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,880
[RURI]
I'm over here! Uh!

125
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:12,184
[MISAKI] She fell
right on her face!
[KANOU & YUKIMURA] (shocked) Ah!

126
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:14,587
[YUKIMURA]
Aah! R‐Ruri!

127
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,122
[MISAKI]
Calm down, Yukimura.

128
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,224
[AOI]
Oh, she got up.

129
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,360
[RURI]
(holding back tears)

130
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,532
[MISAKI] Oh no, she looks
like she's gonna cry!
[YUKIMURA] Poor, Ruri!

131
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,668
[RURI]
I‐I'm a princess...

132
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:31,738
...So I can't cry no
matter what happens

133
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:34,307
[USUI]
I see.

134
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:36,142
[ALL] (surprised)

135
00:07:36,242 --> 00:07:40,647
[AOI] Somehow... I didn't expect
him to do that at all.
[RURI] (happy laugh)

136
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:42,248
[MISAKI] Uh‐huh...

137
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:46,285
[YUKIMURA]
I bet she'd be happy... if she
had an older brother like that.

138
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:48,421
[MISAKI]
Yukimura...

139
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,657
[YUKIMURA]
He's cool and strong...

140
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:52,592
[YUKIMURA]
I can't really blame her...

141
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:57,129
that's the kind of brother
any girl would love to have,
not like me.

142
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,499
[MISAKI]
Yukimura...

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,336
[GIRL A]
Look over there! Are they
filming something?

144
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:05,405
[GIRL B]
That girl looks like
his little sister.

145
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:09,208
[GIRL A]
She's so lucky to have a big
brother like that!

146
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:10,977
[MISAKI] Change of plans!
[KANOU] We had a plan?

147
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:14,481
Listen up! Initially, we
expected things to go
something like this:

148
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,383
[MISAKI]
But... At this rate, if we don't
do something

149
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,918
Usui will steal the title of
"big brother" altogether!
[USUI] (evil laugh)

150
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,220
[YUKIMURA] I knew it!
[MISAKI] Here's what we do!
[KANOU] Is this really
necessary...?

151
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,323
[AOI] What're they trying to
keep a secret for?
[MISAKI] whisper, whisper...

152
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,325
[KANOU]
(thug growl)

153
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:26,659
Perfect! He looks like a bad guy
(YUKIMURA scared)

154
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,961
straight out of a movie!
Lookin' good, Kanou!

155
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,398
[AOI]
Hmph! Of course he does‐
I'm the one who dressed him.

156
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:33,165
[MISAKI]
Fantastic! Aoi, you're a genius!

157
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,267
[KANOU]
I can't do something like this‐
it'll never work

158
00:08:35,368 --> 00:08:37,304
[MISAKI]
You'll be fine, Kanou.
I believe in you!

159
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:38,671
[MISAKI]
Alright‐ here's the plan.

160
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,172
[MISAKI]
Kanou shows up and picks a
fight.

161
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:42,208
Ruri's in trouble!
Usui gets scared.

162
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,945
And Yukimura, the true
hero, bravely steps in
to save the day.

163
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:47,580
[MISAKI]
I call it...

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,382
[AOI]
Hurry up and go pick
a fight with him!

165
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,083
[KANOU]
What am I supposed to say?

166
00:08:51,183 --> 00:08:53,520
[MISAKI]
"If ya don't wanna die, do what
I tell ya."

167
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,724
[MISAKI]
Something like that should work.
Usui should recognize it's you
right away,

168
00:08:57,824 --> 00:09:01,461
so just wait for the signal,
and let Yukimura do his thing.

169
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:03,730
[KANOU]
Hey, you there.

170
00:09:05,765 --> 00:09:10,036
[PEDESTRIANS] (intrigued)
[KANOU] I‐If ya... If...
(nervous)

171
00:09:10,136 --> 00:09:11,203
[RURI] Huh? If?

172
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,238
[KANOU] I can't do it!

173
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:13,506
[YUKIMURA]
Come back, Kanou!

174
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:14,941
[MISAKI]
I guess it was too much for him.

175
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,543
[AOI]
In that case,
I have a backup plan.

176
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,345
[MISAKI]
Great! What is it?

177
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:20,246
And all the maid ladies wear
cute uniforms

178
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:21,714
with frilly skirts
and white aprons!

179
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:24,484
[RURI]
The dishes and cups are so
pretty and fancy.

180
00:09:24,584 --> 00:09:27,520
It's just like having a tea
party like a real princess!

181
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,558
[YUKIMURA]
I wonder if Ruri's taking him to
that expensive café she likes so
much...

182
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,293
[AOI]
Sorry for the wait.

183
00:09:33,393 --> 00:09:35,562
[YUKIMURA]
Uh? M‐Miss President?!

184
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:39,532
[YUKIMURA]
Why are you dressed like that?

185
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,601
[KANOU]
Now YOU look like a character
out of a movie.

186
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:44,404
[AOI] What do you think
I brought this camera for?
[GIRL A] Ohh... They're filming.

187
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:48,207
[AOI] And I happen to have
just found the perfect
extras for the shoot.
[KANOU] Extras?

188
00:09:48,308 --> 00:09:52,078
[AOI] Oh crap‐ hide!
[SUZUNA] They say it's luckier
to mail entry cards from THIS
mailbox.

189
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:54,514
[AOI] Phew, that
was way too close.
[YUKIMURA] What was?

190
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:57,517
[AOI] Hide!
[SATSUKI] This beautiful
weather gets me all happy
inside!

191
00:09:57,617 --> 00:10:00,953
[SATSUKI]
Still, the ennui brought on by
rainy days also has a certain
kind of cuteness, too.

192
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:03,823
[AOI] There's more!
[SAKURA] Hey what d'you say we
run into that one store again?

193
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:07,159
[SHIZUKO]
We've been there 3 times in the
last week‐ is there something
you want to buy?

194
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,563
[SAKURA]
No I just like to visit the same
store over and over again‐ it
makes shopping more fun!

195
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:11,964
[SHIZUKO]
Is that so...

196
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:13,800
[AOI]
(sigh) Looks like we're safe
now.

197
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,768
[YUKIMURA]
Um, wanna tell us what
that was all about?

198
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,805
[AOI]
Nothing really‐ just trying to
avoid a repeat of last time.

199
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:20,540
[ICHIROU]
Look everyone,
it's our Master!

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,941
[JIROU]
Filming something again?

201
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,576
[SHIROU]
Anything with which we can out?

202
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:25,144
[MISAKI]
Uh, no, that's all right,
thanks.

203
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:26,779
[INUYAMA BROTHERS]
Is that so? In that case,
farewell!

204
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,048
[AOI]
So, uh... what was
I saying again?

205
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:32,352
[YUKIMURA] You were
explaining the new plan.
[KANOU] And about
these "extras."

206
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:34,987
[AOI] Oh yeah‐ First, we get
out of here and there'll
be a run‐in with our extras,

207
00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:36,956
and then YOU guys will...
[TRIO] Hey, dammit! You
pickin' a fight, pal?

208
00:10:37,056 --> 00:10:38,858
[SHIROKAWA]
We saw a frilly‐frilly Misa!

209
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,560
[SARASHINA]
Frilly‐frilly Misa asked us to
do this PERSONALLY!

210
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,028
[KUROSAKI]
How's this for a scary face?!

211
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,163
[AOI]
Ah! I told them not to come out
too soon!

212
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:47,734
Those Three Idiots get dumber
every time I see them! So
much for my script!

213
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:50,670
[MISAKI] So that's the plan. I'm
counting on you.
[TRIO] Aye aye, sir!

214
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,805
[TRIO] Whoa!
[AOI] Hurry, Misakichi,
you've gotta do something!

215
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:55,742
[MISAKI] Huh?! What do you want
me to do?
[AOI] Usui tossed them aside
like nothing!

216
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:58,911
[AOI] Now they're going into a
store! Hurry up already,
Misakichi!
[MISAKI] Fine dammit,

217
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:04,851
[MISAKI]
How cruel, Prince Takumi! I am
your fiancé, but here you are in
the arms of another woman!

218
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:08,220
[MISAKI]
Why must you always do this to
me, your fiancé?

219
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:11,858
When you tire of this princess,
you will simply cast her aside,
too, won't you?!

220
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:16,128
[USUI]
(laugh) That's right. Once I'm
finished, I'll toss her like a
prize I won at an arcade game.

221
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:18,130
[MISAKI]
What the heck is that?!
Take this more seriously!

222
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,567
[USUI] Huuuuh? Alright, fine.
In that case...

223
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:24,437
[USUI]
I'm sorry, Princess Misaki. To
think I've been blind to your
love this entire time...!

224
00:11:24,537 --> 00:11:28,107
[USUI] Please forgive me. This
was the only way I could be sure
of your affections.
[MISAKI] Hu‐ Eh!

225
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:30,743
[AOI] Hey, you're up!
[YUKIMURA] Huh? You‐you mean
it's my turn?

226
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:35,348
[MISAKI] Hey, Usui!
[USUI] There is no need to
worry. You, Princess Misaki, are
the only one I love.

227
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,649
[YUKIMURA]
That's enough of that!

228
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:38,217
[RURI] For crying out loud!
[YUKIMURA] Ah?

229
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,219
Why do you always have to get in
the way, stupid brother?!

230
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,889
[YUKIMURA] She found me out!
[RURI] I'm supposed to be a
princess!

231
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:45,257
[RURI]
I hate you, Big Brother!

232
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:46,593
[YUKIMURA]
Ruri!

233
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,927
[BUTLER]
Welcome to our shop.

234
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,029
Slow down, young lady!
[MAID] Ah!

235
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,600
[RURI]
Huh?!

236
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,802
(RURI bracing herself)

237
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,109
[BUTLER]
Is everyone all right?

238
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,277
[MISAKI]
I‐I'm so sorry for the
disturbance.

239
00:12:05,378 --> 00:12:06,813
[YUKIMURA]
Ruri! Are you okay?

240
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,816
You're not hurt are you?
Did you hit your head?!

241
00:12:10,517 --> 00:12:11,784
[RURI]
I'm okay...

242
00:12:11,884 --> 00:12:13,653
[YUKIMURA]
Oh thank goodness.

243
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,489
[BUTLER]
Kids these days! Thinking you
can stir up a ruckus in our
shop!

244
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,159
[YUKIMURA]
Ah! Let's go apologize to
them properly. Brother will
go with you.

245
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,995
[RURI] No! I didn't
do anything wrong.
[YUKIMURA] Uh!

246
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:29,569
[RURI]
You and the all the others were
being mean to me. I was supposed
to be a princess today.

247
00:12:29,669 --> 00:12:33,640
Uh‐huh, that's right. I'm a
princess, so I don't have to
say sorry for anything!

248
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,041
[YUKIMURA]
That's enough, Ruri!

249
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,709
(RURI gasps)

250
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,616
[YUKIMURA]
That's not the kind of thing a
princess is supposed to say, now
is it?

251
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:46,753
[YUKIMURA]
You'll never find a
prince like that.

252
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,321
[YUKIMURA]
Ruri...

253
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,923
[RURI]
I'm sorry!

254
00:12:56,296 --> 00:12:59,198
[RURI]
I'm sorryyyy!

255
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:05,137
[MISAKI]
I'm really sorry, Ruri. We
weren't trying to be mean I
promise.

256
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:08,541
[USUI]
Yeah, you put on a real show
this time didn't you?

257
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:09,876
[YUKIMURA]
Ruri...

258
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:12,379
[RURI]
It's okay. Looks
like I'm not ready

259
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:16,349
to be a princess yet. Besides...

260
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,286
[RURI]
It looks like Prince Takumi
already has a princess of his
own.

261
00:13:21,388 --> 00:13:22,655
[RURI]
Let's go home, Big Brother.

262
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:24,256
[YUKIMURA] Mm. Ah!

263
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,961
[YUKIMURA]
Today my princess became a
little bit more grown up...

264
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:34,033
But it seems like she's still
got a long way to go before she
finds a prince of her own.

265
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:54,220
[AOI] Hmmm... Like I thought,
mounting the camera like this
isn't a enough to get
everything.

266
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,689
[AOI]
Looks like the only way to
capture all of my cuteness is by
getting a cameraman.

267
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,058
[MAN A] Hey, what're you doin'
over here all by yourself,
cutie? That sure is one fancy
dress.

268
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:01,694
[AOI] Also, someone to do
lighting and throw a few petals
would be great...

269
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:03,963
[MAN B]
Whoa. She's even cuter up close
and personal.

270
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,633
[MAN A]
Hey, what do you say we all go
have some fun somewh‐

271
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,868
[YUKIMURA] Th‐That's
enough of that!
[AOI] Hm?

272
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:13,205
[AOI, voiceover]
Aoi Hyoudou, 14 years old.
An Internet idol whose beauty
has no comparison.

273
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,508
[YUKIMURA]
L‐look‐ you're scaring that poor
girl!

274
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:18,311
[KANOU]
You feel the desperate urge to
go to the toilet‐ hurry up and
get out of here.

275
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:22,081
[AOI, voiceover]
Appearances aside, Aoi
is actually a boy.

276
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:25,818
[YUKIMURA]
(sigh) Thank goodness!
They gave up and went away.

277
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:30,757
[YUKIMURA] Are you all right?
You don't have to be scared
anymore! They sure did run off
in a hurry, didn't they?

278
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:34,794
[KANOU] I think they went
to the bathroom.
[AOI, thinking]
Who are these wretched

279
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,564
[AOI, thinking]
Oh yeah! It's those geeky guys
who were with Misakichi before.

280
00:14:37,664 --> 00:14:40,867
[AOI, thinking]
I wasn't dressed like this
last time. Guess they don't
recognize me.

281
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:44,671
[AOI]
Say, I have one teensy
favor to ask you... Heh.

282
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:49,476
[AOI]
Yes, that's perfect. Do an
overhead shot‐ I look prettiest
at that angle!

283
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:53,413
[YUKIMURA]
But when you say we're doing
a "promotional video"...
what's that?

284
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:57,317
[AOI]
I'm the famous Internet idol,
Aoi! For someone as famous as
myself a promo is a must!

285
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,719
[YUKIMURA]
Is an Internet celebrity
like a real celebrity?

286
00:14:59,819 --> 00:15:01,253
[KANOU]
No, in reality they're normal
people

287
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,055
who go online and simply claim
to be celebrities. Huh?!

288
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:05,224
[AOI]
I can hear you, you know!

289
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,428
If you type "pure cuteness" into
any major search engine I rank
first every time!

290
00:15:08,528 --> 00:15:12,532
I've used my perfectly polished
cuteness SPARKLE like a diamond
among rocks! (giggling)

291
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:15,735
[AOI] Just thinking
about it makes me happy!
[YUKIMURA] That girl's
kind of incredible.

292
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:18,305
[KANOU]
Indeed.

293
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:20,840
[SATSUKI]
Oh, I'm so glad I came
to the flea market today!

294
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,445
I've been looking all over
for a new garbage can to go
in the kitchen... and this
was so cheap!

295
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:30,983
[SUZUNA]
Wow... People sell all sorts
of things at flea markets.
I'm really surprised.

296
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,320
[SAKURA] There!
[SHIZUKO] Uh oh! Take this!

297
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,721
[AOI]
(irritated)

298
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:35,922
[AOI]
What the heck is this?!

299
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,123
[YUKIMURA]
It's a flea market.

300
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,891
I know it's a flea
market, you moron!

301
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,494
But why are they doing this
crap today of all days?! Huh?

302
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:44,564
[SUZUNA] Welcome‐ need help?
[SATSUKI] I think I'll just take
a break right over here!
[AOI] And it looks like things

303
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,699
[SAKURA] How fun!
[INUYAMA BROTHERS]
Five of the same, please.

304
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,669
[AOI]
(irritated) I wanted to get
a shot with the river in the
background!

305
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,104
[AOI] I can't do
any filming at all!
[YUKIMURA] "River"?
[KANOU] I think she

306
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:53,973
[AOI] Ah!
[KANOU & YUKIMURA] Huh?
[TRIO] Uh?

307
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:55,875
[SARASHINA] Aoi!
[KUROSAKI] What are you
doing here?!

308
00:15:55,975 --> 00:15:57,810
[AOI]
Ugh what are YOU
three doing here?

309
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,246
[KUROSAKI]
Should we tell'em we're trying
to earn money to go to Maid
Latte?

310
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:03,082
[SARASHINA]
I don't know about saying all
that in front of the vice
president.

311
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:05,184
[SHIROKAWA]
Why do those guys get to hang
out with Aoi?

312
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:09,155
[AOI] At this rate, my first DVD
is gonna be completely ruined!
[TRIO] DVD?!

313
00:16:09,255 --> 00:16:11,558
[SHIROKAWA] Isn't
that awesome, Ikkun?
[SARASHINA] It sure is Shiroyan!

314
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,993
[KUROSAKI] Would it be sexy?
[SARASHINA] Shut up,
you stupid pervert!

315
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:19,366
[SARASHINA]
Hey? How did we end up
holding a camera?

316
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:23,235
[AOI]
I'd like you to... film EVERY
single part of me, okay?

317
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:25,472
[TRIO]
(gushing) We'll film it!
We'll definitely film it!

318
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:29,108
[AOI, thinking]
I'm a genius‐ fanboys like them
couldn't possibly turn me down.

319
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,178
[AOI]
More flower petals!
And there's not enough light!

320
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,182
[SARASHINA]
Okay, now it's perfect! Here
goes, Aoi! Action!

321
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,250
(AOI giggling)

322
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:40,853
(AOI giggling)

323
00:16:42,822 --> 00:16:44,524
[AOI]
Mmmm...

324
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,995
[AOI]
It's still missing something.

325
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,397
[SHIROKAWA]
Should we use more petals?

326
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:52,164
[KUROSAKI]
But we don't have
any more petals.

327
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:54,367
[AOI] Then just go pick them
all up again.
[BOTH] Huh!?

328
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:58,471
B‐but I stayed up all night
making those flower petals with
my own two hands...!

329
00:16:58,571 --> 00:17:01,808
[SHIROKAWA]
Man is a pitiful creature
indeed, huh, Kurotatsu.

330
00:17:01,908 --> 00:17:04,944
[KUROSAKI]
Actually, WE'RE the ones who are
the pitiful creatures, Shiroyan.

331
00:17:05,044 --> 00:17:07,414
[AOI]
Hey‐ you over there.
Bring me a stuffed animal.

332
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:12,485
[YUKIMURA] Huh?
[AOI] A stuffed animal‐ and
make it a cute one. You have
something like that, don't you?

333
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:14,687
[AOI]
Hurry up‐ I want to use it for
my shoot.

334
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:17,490
[YUKIMURA] Huh? You mean me? I
don't know about that...
my little sister has some

335
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,293
[YUKIMURA] but she'll mad
if I just take them...
[RURI] Big Brother don't touch
these or I'll hate you forever!

336
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:23,363
[YUKIMURA] What should
I do, Kanou?!
[KANOU] Why don't YOU just be
the stuffed animal instead?

337
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:29,135
[YUKIMURA] What?! What are you
talking about, Kanou?!
[KANOU] All you'd have to do is
wear a teddy bear costume and it

338
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:33,906
[TRIO]
One‐two! One‐two! We collected
them all!

339
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:35,875
[KUROSAKI]
And there's no dog crap either!

340
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,344
[AOI]
I'm sorry for the wait.

341
00:17:37,444 --> 00:17:39,712
I changed into my maid
outfit‐ what do you think?

342
00:17:39,812 --> 00:17:41,514
[KANOU & YUKIMURA] (shocked)
[TRIO] (excited)

343
00:17:41,614 --> 00:17:43,583
[SHIROKAWA] Aoi as a maid?!
[SARASHINA] It's like a
dream come true!

344
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:46,185
Let's get one thing straight‐
I'm not JUST a "maid".

345
00:17:46,285 --> 00:17:49,021
From now on you'll call me
"MISS Maid"‐ You guys got that!?

346
00:17:49,121 --> 00:17:51,924
[KUROSAKI]
Miss Maid, you say...
That sounds kind of hot.

347
00:17:52,024 --> 00:17:53,293
[SHIROKAWA]
Huh? But wait a sec...

348
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:54,994
[SARASHINA]
Yeah, sure enough...

349
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:56,696
[TRIO] "Miss Maid" makes
you think of our‐

350
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,465
[MISAKI]
Masters... would you like some
candy or the whip today?

351
00:17:58,565 --> 00:18:00,367
[AOI]
What the heck are you
freaks imagining?!

352
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:01,868
You're grossing me out!

353
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,504
[SARASHINA]
Wow! We sure got
some great shots!

354
00:18:04,604 --> 00:18:06,406
[SHIROKAWA]
Why are we picking
these up again?

355
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,140
[KUROSAKI]
We've been seduced by the power
of the maid outfit.

356
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,310
[KANOU]
Yukimura, you seem to be
enjoying yourself.

357
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,712
[YUKIMURA]
Because everyone else seems like
they're having a lot of fun,
too.

358
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:15,615
[SHIROKAWA]
Okay! Time to take this shoot in
a whole new direction!

359
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,850
[KUROSAKI]
Oh nice! You mean like a
striptease or somethin'?

360
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,252
[SHIROKAWA]
No you dumbass! I mean we have
to give it more action and
adventure!

361
00:18:20,353 --> 00:18:22,422
[AOI]
Hey! What do you
think you're doing‐?!

362
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:25,825
[SARASHINA] FOOLS! You guys
don't understand Aoi at all!
[SHIROKAWA] Ikkun!

363
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:29,662
[SARASHINA]
Listen up! Aoi is not simply an
internet idol‐ she is an oasis
for the hearts of all men,

364
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:32,765
a pure‐hearted fairy whose
innocence is the saving
grace of humanity!

365
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:35,635
[SARASHINA] She doesn't
need any action!
[KUROSAKI & SHIROKAWA]
What was that?!

366
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,405
[KUROSAKI]
Just because you're a nerd
doesn't mean you have to be a
snob, too!

367
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:41,273
[SARASHINA] Uh, well I...
[SHIROKAWA] If you don't like
our ideas then why don't you
come up with something!

368
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:44,110
[SARASHINA]
Well, we could dress Aoi as a
goddess and show her frolicking
with fairies...

369
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,014
[SHIROKAWA] Where the hell are
we supposed to find fairies?
[YUKIMURA] What if someone
cosplayed as one?

370
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:50,717
[KANOU] Wouldn't it be best if
you were the one who did it?
[YUKIMURA] Huh?

371
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:53,353
[KUROSAKI] Whoa! Good idea‐
that'd be freaking hilarious!
[SHIROKAWA] It can't be funny,
can it?

372
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:55,999
[SARASHINA]
I already told you guys that
Aoi's not that kind of idol‐!

373
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:58,035
[AOI] Heh! (laughing)
[ALL] Huh?

374
00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:01,004
I can't believe you guys are
getting worked up over something
so stupid!

375
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:04,074
[YUKIMURA]
Miss Aoi... Your expression is
so fresh‐looking!

376
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,609
[AOI] Uh?
[KUROSAKI] Yeah,
it's fresh for sure!

377
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:09,046
[SHIROKAWA] The
freshest of the fresh!
[SARASHINA] My heart
was a‐flutter!

378
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:11,414
[AOI]
What are you morons even talking
about?! I'm "cute", not "fresh"!

379
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,650
[YUKIMURA]
But just now you were even cuter
than normal.

380
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,020
When you laughed it was like
your whole face lit up‐ you
looked adorable!

381
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,823
[AOI]
Uh?! Don't be ridiculous. I was
just caught off guard by your
stupidity, that's all!

382
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:24,961
[ALL] Uh...
[AOI] There's no way that I,
Aoi, could have fun with the
likes of YOU, is there?!

383
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:26,829
[TRIO] (sobbing)
[YUKIMURA] That's so mean...!

384
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:28,665
[AOI]
I knew it‐ getting
anything good filmed

385
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:30,667
is impossible with
a bunch of amateurs.

386
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,703
[AOI]
I graced you with my presence
because I didn't have much of a
choice,

387
00:19:33,803 --> 00:19:35,905
but it looks like it
was a total waste.

388
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,540
[AOI] Ah‐ah!
[YUKIMURA] Miss Aoi!

389
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,609
[SARASHINA]
What the hell's his problem?!

390
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,744
[AOI]
(gasp)

391
00:19:42,945 --> 00:19:44,347
[ALL]
Huh?! Aoi!

392
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,383
[AOI]
(reaching) Aahhh!

393
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:57,027
[MISAKI]
(relieved) Thank goodness,
I made it just in time.

394
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,029
[MISAKI] Are you all right?
[AOI] (stunned)

395
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,663
[YUKIMURA]
Huh? Miss President?

396
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:02,199
[MISAKI]
Huh?

397
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,134
[YUKIMURA]
You were chasing after a
purse snatcher?!

398
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,469
[KANOU]
Then the man who
bumped Aoi earlier...

399
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,506
[MISAKI]
Yep, that was him. I got the bag
back to its owner,

400
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,408
but that guy still
managed to get away.

401
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:14,744
[MISAKI]
Still, it's strange to see all
of you together. What were you
doing?

402
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:17,914
[YUKIMURA] F‐Filming...
[MISAKI] Oh, so you were
helping Aoi out, right?

403
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:22,219
[YUKIMURA] Miss President, are
you a friend of Aoi's?
[MISAKI] Uh, yeah, I guess you
could say that.

404
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,822
[YUKIMURA] Good thing Aoi didn't
get hurt, huh, Kanou?
[MISAKI, thinking] Looks like
they haven't noticed who he is.

405
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:29,226
[KANOU]
Still, to me it appeared that
Aoi attempted to jump forward
herself‐

406
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,628
not because that man
pushed her from behind...

407
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:33,463
[MISAKI]
But why...?

408
00:20:33,563 --> 00:20:36,866
[MISAKI]
I know! Maybe she was about to
drop something important to her.

409
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,568
[AOI] Huh? Unh.

410
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:41,238
[KANOU]
Or maybe she ended up dropping
it anyway or something.

411
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,540
[YUKIMURA] Then we gotta help
her go look for it!
[TRIO] We'll look, too!

412
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,842
[AOI]
You've got it all wrong!
Just forget about it already!

413
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:49,446
[MISAKI]
Don't be like that, Aoi.
They're just trying to help
you cuz they're worried.

414
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,414
[MISAKI]
If you act like that, your
friends are going to‐

415
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:54,651
They're not my friends, okay!
Besides they already hate me
anyway!

416
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:55,952
[ALL] Huh?

417
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,820
[MISAKI] Is that true, you guys?
[ALL] Uh‐un.

418
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,124
[AOI]
How could you NOT hate me!
Especially after I said such
rude things.

419
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:03,226
[SHIROKAWA]
But when did you
say something rude?

420
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,695
[AOI] I called you annoying and
idiots and creepy, remember?!
[ALL] Oh...

421
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:07,797
[KUROSAKI]
Hey, that's what we call each
other all the time.

422
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:10,333
[AOI]
Yeah but it's different
when you're with your
friends, isn't it?!

423
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,669
[SARASHINA] Huh?
It's no big deal.
[SHIROKAWA] Because
we're the type of guys‐

424
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,572
[KUROSAKI]
Who prefer people who don't pull
their punches‐ 'cause that's how
we are.

425
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,608
[KUROSAKI]
'Sides you weren't wrong about
Shiroyan‐ he's an idiot to the
core!

426
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,478
[SHIROKAWA]
And Kurotatsu's creepiness
is second‐to‐none!

427
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,913
[BOTH] Grr...
[SARASHINA] (amused laughter)
Ah, those two are such a
handful.

428
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:26,349
[SHIROKAWA]
Where do you get off actin' like
you're the only normal one?!

429
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,518
[KUROSAKI]
Yeah, you're WAY creepier,
you friggin' fanboy nerd!

430
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,753
[SARASHINA]
Hey, that really hurt my
feelings, you know!

431
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:31,954
[TRIO]
(brawling)

432
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:33,456
[YUKIMURA]
Stop, you guys...

433
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:35,092
[MISAKI]
Enough!

434
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,694
[SARASHINA]
That felt nice, Misa...

435
00:21:37,794 --> 00:21:38,861
[SHIROKAWA]
It's been so long...

436
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:40,063
[KUROSAKI]
Yeah, too long...

437
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,032
Well, I can definitely
understand why

438
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:44,767
you'd call guys like those
annoying and creepy, Aoi.

439
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,303
(AOI giggles)

440
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,007
I can't believe it...

441
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:52,342
[AOI] (giggles)
[TRIO] (happy)

442
00:21:52,442 --> 00:21:56,213
[YUKIMURA]
Oh! We have to hurry and look
for what she dropped before it
gets dark!

443
00:22:05,155 --> 00:22:06,589
[USUI]
Four gigs...?

444
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,260
[AOI]
I've never met people like this.

445
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:14,864
[AOI] Guess there's no other
choice. I'll allow you to
become my servants.

446
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:17,134
[YUKIMURA] Servants?
[KANOU] No thank you.
[SARASHINA] Servants, huh?

447
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,969
[SHIROKAWA] How exciting.
[KUROSAKI] How erotic!

448
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:52,295
[RURI]
This is Ruri Yukimura.

449
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:54,497
[RURI]
It's hard to find a prince like
Prince Takumi, isn't it?

450
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:57,800
[AOI]
I felt sorry for him, so I
dressed your brother up more
like a prince.

451
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,236
[YUKIMURA]
What do you think, Ruri?

452
00:23:59,336 --> 00:24:01,104
[RURI]
Hmm. You look like a weird
prince.

453
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:02,639
[YUKIMURA]
(sobbing)

454
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:04,941
[AOI]
Yeah, you do look a lot weirder
than I intended.

455
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,544
[YUKIMURA]
(sobbing)

456
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,812
[AOI]
Anyway, making rice balls
sure is hard...

457
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,248
[USUI] Miss President?
[MISAKI] Ulp!

458
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:12,549
[USUI]
What are you making?

459
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:14,284
[MISAKI]
Uh. Don't look! No
peeking, okay!

460
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,686
[SAKURA]
Misaki! It's a bakery delivery!

461
00:24:16,786 --> 00:24:19,256
[MISAKI]
Here come the bread crusts!
