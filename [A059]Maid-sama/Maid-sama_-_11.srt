00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:37,864
<react>

2
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,568
[MINAKO] Oh, wait!

3
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,469
[MINAKO] C'mon, quit trying to
get away.

4
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,439
[USUI] There's one over here,
too.

5
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,108
[MINAKO] Oh my, you're right.

6
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,343
Thank you for being so kind.

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:50,844
<react>

8
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,255
[MINAKO] I'm sorry for having to
trouble you like this...

9
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:03,189
[USUI] It's fine.

10
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,558
[MINAKO] Your uniform...

11
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,827
You're a Seika student, aren't
you?

12
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,763
[MINAKO] I'm glad! Even though
the school has a bad reputation,

13
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,265
it does have its good students.
[USUI] Ah...

14
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:15,301
Actually, my daughter
happens to go there, too.

15
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,670
[MINAKO] But she's so focused on
her schoolwork

16
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,940
that she doesn't seem to
make a lot of friends,

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,341
especially with boys.

18
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,009
[MINAKO] I used to worry about
her all the time.

19
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,477
I wasn't sure if she'd really be

20
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,547
able to enjoy high school to the
fullest.

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,115
And when she's not at school,
she's either studying or
working.

22
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,352
Aren't normal high school girls
supposed to have fun and fall in
love?

23
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,187
They get all dolled up and
go on dates and things?

24
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,222
[USUI] Uh... Yeah I guess.

25
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,593
[MINAKO] I guess I'm the one to
blame, though,

26
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:42,563
I haven't exactly made her life
easy...

27
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,264
[MINAKO] But now I feel much
more relieved.

28
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,733
I'm really glad I ran into you.

29
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,770
Because you seem like a very
kind young man.

30
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:55,075
Recently, she does seem like
she's become more like a normal
high school girl.

31
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,211
[MINAKO] I'm sure it's because
she's made friends with someone
nice like you.

32
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,749
[USUI] Um... has anyone ever
referred to your daughter as
"unreserved"?

33
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,817
Oh?

34
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,185
[MINAKO] Why yes, all the time.

35
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,820
You're quite perceptive.

36
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,226
[MINAKO] Thank you again.
you've really been a big help.

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,327
[USUI] I had a feeling this was
gonna happen,

38
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,029
but I can't believe I was right.

39
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,598
[MINAKO] Please, come on in!

40
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,866
[USUI] I'll be on my way then...

41
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,401
[MINAKO] Oh, please wait!

42
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,970
At least let me make
you some tea.

43
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,677
<screaming>

44
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,513
[SUZUNA] Mom, did you fall in
the hole again?

45
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,816
[SUZUNA] Oh. Did you come to fix
the floor?

46
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,853
[SUZUNA] Please help yourself.

47
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,555
[MINAKO] Sorry for all the
trouble I've put you through‐

48
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,356
I even had to ask you to fix our
floor!

49
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,691
[USUI] It's fine.

50
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,260
[SUZUNA] Still, he did such a
good job

51
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,930
that now that's the safest spot
in the entire house.

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,666
[MINAKO] True enough. Won't you
have one, Usui?

53
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,767
[USUI] Yeah.

54
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,602
[SUZUNA] But Mom, you have to be
more careful

55
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,539
and watch your step so we don't
make any more holes.

56
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,273
[MINAKO] Yes, it's gotten pretty
dangerous, hasn't it?

57
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,307
[MISAKI] I'm home!

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,643
[MISAKI] Huh?

59
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,213
[MISAKI] Someone replaced the
floor boards...

60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,882
[MISAKI] Who fixed up the
hallway all nice and...

61
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,283
[MISAKI] Gah!
[MINAKO] Welcome back, Misaki.

62
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,351
[SUZUNA] Welcome back, Sis.

63
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,586
[USUI] Welcome back, Ayuzawa.

64
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,088
[MISAKI] Usui?! Why are you in
my house?

65
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,289
[USUI] Crunch, crunch, crunch.

66
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,458
[USUI] It's kind of a long
story.

67
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,660
[MISAKI] Just spit it out
already!

68
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,327
[MINAKO] Oh, my! What
coincidence‐

69
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,396
so the two of you happen to be
friends after all.

70
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,131
[SUZUNA] I think you've got it
wrong, Mom.

71
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,501
[MINAKO] I invited him to come
in for a bit.

72
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:31,371
[MINAKO] He helped me carry my
apples after they spilled out
all over the road.

73
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,340
[MINAKO] He even fixed the holes
in the hallway for us.

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,009
[MISAKI] You're plotting
something aren't you?

75
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,679
[USUI] Oh no, you caught me.

76
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,414
[SUZUNA] Sis, you really...
don't trust guys at all, do you?

77
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,382
[MISAKI] What?!

78
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,050
Yes, that certainly seems

79
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,552
to be the case, doesn't it?

80
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,387
[SUZUNA] After all, it's hard to
trust another man

81
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,922
when your father runs out on you
like ours did.

82
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,824
[MISAKI] Don't just casually say
something like that

83
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,027
in front of a stranger!
And you, that's nothing
to laugh about!

84
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,428
Enough, just get outta here.

85
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:56,530
[USUI] Sorry for the bother.

86
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,332
Oh, Usui, you're leaving
already?

87
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,234
[SUZUNA] See you next time.

88
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,705
[MISAKI] Hurry up now! Come on!

89
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,841
[SAKURA] Huuuh? Hey wait a
second. Was that Misaki and
Usui?

90
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,577
[SHIZUKO] Yes, I believe it was.
[SAKURA] Am I going crazy

91
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,045
or did they just come out of
Misaki's house together?!

92
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,380
[SHIZUKO] Furthermore, if my
eyes did not deceive me,

93
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,649
they were also holding hands.

94
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,283
[SAKURA] We've gotta follow
them!

95
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,519
[SHIZUKO] Unfortunately...

96
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,987
It would appear we've
already lost them.

97
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,089
[SAKURA] Aw, they got away...

98
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,230
[MISAKI] I dragged Usui along
and now we ended up here...

99
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,565
[USUI] Picking up those apples
from the road

100
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,600
and "accidentally" bumping into
your mom...

101
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,837
[USUI] You think I planned that
whole thing, don't you?

102
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:40,173
[MISAKI] It's true that my mom's
pretty gullible, but even so...

103
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,575
[MISAKI] You're not the type of
guy

104
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,944
that'd take advantage of someone
like that.

105
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,480
[MISAKI] Thank you. For giving
my mom a hand.

106
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,585
[USUI] You're quite welcome.

107
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,386
[LITTLE GIRL A] Here, it's a
chocolate.

108
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,387
[LITTLE GIRL B] Nuh‐uh!

109
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,455
[USUI] Still, the atmosphere

110
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,957
in your house is refreshing.

111
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,291
[MISAKI] What does that mean?

112
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,795
[USUI] It's helped me
understand some things.

113
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,897
[MISAKI] H‐hey, what's that
smirk about?!

114
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,832
[MISAKI] Don't think this means
you've got something you can use
against me.

115
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,735
[MISAKI] I'm not ashamed that my
dad disappeared without a trace

116
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,604
or that our house is in
shambles!

117
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:14,474
[USUI] That's not what I meant.
What's with those apple slices?

118
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,476
Do you always peel them in the
shape of a rabbit,

119
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,111
or do you only do it for special
guests?

120
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,314
[MISAKI] Mom's always made those
like that since we were kids‐

121
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,916
they were Suzuna's favorite
snack.

122
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,885
[USUI] I also saw where your
heights were marked on the wall.

123
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:25,886
[MISAKI] You saw that?!

124
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,353
[USUI] I bet you were a cute
kid, too.

125
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,289
Probably even cuter than you are
now.

126
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,324
<embarassed>

127
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,762
[USUI] I want so many more
secrets, ones about you that
only I know.

128
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,565
[MISAKI] One secret is more than
enough!

129
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,501
And don't ever come by my house
again‐ got it?!

130
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,035
You're banned from the premises!

131
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,737
[USUI] Whaaat?

132
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,773
[SAKURA] Misaki! Good morninggg!

133
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,041
[SHIZUKO] Good morning, Misaki.

134
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,543
[MISAKI] Oh, good morning.

135
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,177
[SAKURA] Misaki, I swear!

136
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,246
You didn't have to hide it from
us!

137
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,581
[MISAKI] Huh? What are you
talking about?

138
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,449
[SAKURA] Don't play dumb with
me, silly!

139
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,220
We totally saw you and Usui
walking out of your house
together yesterday.

140
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,788
[SHIZUKO] And you were holding
hands.

141
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,790
[SAKURA] VERY tightly!
[MISAKI] You guys saw that?!

142
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,360
[SAKURA] If you're going out,
you're going out. You should've
told us!

143
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,730
[SAKURA] We're friends, right?
Hmph!

144
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,633
[MISAKI] H‐hold on a second!
You've got the wrong idea!

145
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,168
[MISAKI] Usui ran into my mom
and helped her out, so she
invited him INSIDE my house,

146
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:20,440
[MISAKI] so I was holding his
hand while I was trying to drag
him back out, that's all!

147
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,442
[SHIZUKO] Oh, so that's what it
was.

148
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,577
[SAKURA] What a letdown!

149
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,678
I was so excited about it

150
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,946
that I was up all night long!

151
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,247
[SHIZUKO] It's rather
disappointing.

152
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,849
[SAKURA] So then, you've never

153
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,817
gone over to Usui's or anything
either?

154
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,386
[MISAKI] Nope. I don't even know
his address.

155
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,921
Actually, I don't WANT to know.

156
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,590
[SAKURA] Too bad, I thought you
guys

157
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,324
would make such a good
couple, too...

158
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,993
[SHIZUKO] Now now, it's still
possible

159
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,162
that things will take
an unexpected turn.

160
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:44,965
[SAKURA] Yeah, there's still
hope!

161
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:47,834
[SAKURA] But y'know, Usui is
kind of a mystery, huh?

162
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,036
What if he goes to an average
school like Seika

163
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,872
in an attempt to cover up his
secret identity

164
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,474
as the heir to a vast fortune or
something like that?

165
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,510
[MISAKI] No, I can't picture
that at all.

166
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,078
[SAKURA] And every day after
school,

167
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,881
he goes and swims a few laps at
a high‐class sports club,

168
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,983
then goes and gets
fitted in a high‐class,
custom‐tailored suit,

169
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,651
then wears it straight
out of the store

170
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,587
to eat a full‐course
meal at a high‐class restaurant!

171
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,489
[SHIZUKO] I think someone's
allowing her imagination

172
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,057
to get a little too
carried away.

173
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,926
[SAKURA] No, I'm not! It could
totally be true!

174
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:17,798
[MISAKI] After school,
Usui just goes to Maid Latte
every day...

175
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,633
[MISAKI] Nah, there's no way.

176
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,003
[SAKURA] Hey, why don't we all
go see Usui's house?
[MISAKI] Huh? What for?

177
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,506
[SAKURA] Now I definitely
wanna know what his story is...

178
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,608
[SAKURA] Like what he does when
he's not at school!

179
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,909
You wanna know too, right
Misaki?

180
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,544
[MISAKI] Uh, no,
I'm not really interested.

181
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,012
But first we have to

182
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,880
find a way to get ahold
of his address.

183
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,582
But the school won't just hand
over his contact information

184
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,217
because of the Personal
Information Protection Act or

185
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,919
whatever, so we'll have to hack
into the school's computer and

186
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,721
dive into their secret files and
get it ourselves, all

187
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,455
secret‐like. Shizuko, you're
good with computers, aren't you?

188
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:43,524
Hack into the mainframe!

189
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,758
That would be a heinous offense.

190
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,459
[SAKURA] Guess that's out.

191
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,728
Well how about we just ask him
directly?

192
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,062
[SAKURA] Go ask him, Misaki.

193
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,164
[MISAKI] I'm telling you,
I'm not interested!

194
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:04,244
[MISAKI] You know, I am kinda
curious about what Usui's family
is like...

195
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,046
[USUI] Usui's mom.

196
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,748
[USUI] Usui's dad.

197
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,683
[USUI] Usui's younger sister.

198
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,751
[USUI] Usui's baby brother.

199
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:11,685
[USUI] Takumi is so grateful to‐

200
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,653
[MISAKI] It's no good!

201
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,087
I can't imagine it at all!

202
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:17,624
Maybe he really is an
alien from another planet.

203
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,360
That would explain a lot.

204
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,628
[MISAKI] Master, do your best!

205
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,864
Why am I even giving it
this much thought?

206
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:26,900
It must be because of what
Sakura said earlier.

207
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,035
[MISAKI] Oh, my phone.

208
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,171
[MISAKI] Wow, speaking of here
she is.

209
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,607
[MISAKI] Yeah, this is Ayuzawa.
You there Sakura?

210
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,475
[SAKURA] Misaki! We need you to
come here, and fast!

211
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,410
[MISAKI] What's going on?

212
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,613
[SAKURA] Shizuko and I are
tailing Usui.

213
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,582
[MISAKI] No way! Are you
seriously tailing him?!

214
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,851
[SAKURA] He just walked into
some maid coffee shop in the
neighboring town.

215
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,753
[MISAKI] What's he doing in the
neighboring town?

216
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,589
[MISAKI] Wait, THIS is the
neighboring town...

217
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,390
[SAKURA] The shop's name is,
let's see...

218
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,592
[SHIZUKO] Maid Latte!

219
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,659
<maximum shockage>

220
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,094
[SAKURA] Yeah, it's Maid Latte.

221
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,829
Definitely Maid Latte.
Have you heard of it, Misaki?

222
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,900
[SAKURA] Hello? Misaki? Can you
hear me?

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,202
[SAKURA] Hello? Misaki? Are you
still there‐

224
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,077
[MISAKI] Yup, he's here all
right.

225
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,680
[MISAKI] And those Three Idiots,
too.

226
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,682
[MISAKI] What should I do?

227
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,484
I haven't told either of them
that I work here...

228
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,855
[MISAKI] I'd have to explain why
Usui and those others guys are
here, too...

229
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,558
That would just suck!

230
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,692
[SATSUKI] Huh? Watcha doin',
Misa?

231
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,993
<startled yell>

232
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,929
[SATSUKI] Oh, no! You're
sweating like crazy!

233
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,096
Are you not feeling well today?

234
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,632
[MISAKI] No, it's all right!
This is‐

235
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,534
[SATSUKI] Pushing yourself too
hard like this

236
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,735
is a bad habit of yours, Misa.

237
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,870
Go home and get
plenty of rest today.

238
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,673
[SATSUKI] We have plenty of
coverage so don't worry about
that.

239
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,641
[MISAKI] Okay...

240
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,809
[TRIO] Heave ho! Heave ho!

241
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,078
[SHIROKAWA] The day we've worked
so hard for has finally come!

242
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,213
[SARASHINA] Yeah! Today we're no
longer three broke guys

243
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,816
forced to share a single
Cutesy‐Cutesy Rice Omelette.

244
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,818
[KUROSAKI] We went all out
and ordered the whole menu!

245
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,954
[SHIROKAWA] I bet Misa can't
wait to see us...

246
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,589
[KUROSAKI] Do you think all the
plates'll fit on one table?

247
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,457
[SARASHINA] There's no way they
could!

248
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,825
[HONOKA] Sorry for the wait.

249
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,728
You've ordered one of
everything, is that right?

250
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,929
[TRIO] Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

251
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,130
[HONOKA] Very well then

252
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,799
we'll go ahead and set
everything down.

253
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,367
Please enjoy your meals!

254
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,506
[SHIROKAWA] Excuse me, where's
Misa at?

255
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,707
[HONOKA] I'm sorry, Master,

256
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:16,510
but it appears that Misa has
today off.

257
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,244
[TRIO] She's off?!

258
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,447
[SHIROKAWA] Then what was the
point of ordering all of this
stuff?!

259
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,218
<dead>

260
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:30,591
[SAKURA] Geez, he's been in
there for a long time.

261
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,058
[SHIZUKO] We have to be patient.

262
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,493
[MISAKI] What are you guys
doing?!

263
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:35,061
[SAKURA] Whoa, that sure was
fast!

264
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,030
[SHIZUKO] Misaki, how were you
able to get here so quickly?

265
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,265
[MISAKI] The more important
question is, why are you
following him?

266
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,602
[SAKURA] We realized that even
if we didn't know his address,

267
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:43,870
[SAKURA] we should just follow
him back to his house and see
where he lived for ourselves.

268
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,739
[SAKURA] Look, we brought
a disguise for you, too.

269
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,207
[MISAKI] There's no need for
that.

270
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,374
I already told you

271
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,244
I don't WANT to know about
Usui's personal life.

272
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,614
[SAKURA] Now, now, don't be shy!
We know you're curious!

273
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:57,784
[SAKURA] I can see exactly
what you're thinking, Misaki!
Ha!

274
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,386
[SHIZUKO] Usui is exiting the
store!

275
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,256
[SHIZUKO] He's headed this way.

276
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,862
[MAN B] Sorry, sir, I lost
him.

277
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,064
[MAN A] Oh, well. Just let me
out here.

278
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,365
[MAN B] Okay.

279
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,803
<flirty>

280
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:50,136
[SHIZUKO] Still, looks can be
quite deceiving, can't they? To
think that Usui would visit a
maid cafÃ©...

281
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,939
[SAKURA] Maybe he's got a crush
on one of the girls that works
there.

282
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,609
[SAKURA] But I thought
he was interested in YOU,
Misaki.

283
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,845
Geez, what a bummer. Hmph!

284
00:12:58,945 --> 00:12:59,713
[MISAKI] Sakura!

285
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,947
[SAKURA] Hmph! Hmph!

286
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,716
[MISAKI] Look, I really don't
like this.

287
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,518
Let's just stop
before he catches us.

288
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,686
[SHIZUKO] He's on the move!

289
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,453
[SHIZUKO] He entered this
building.

290
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,290
[SHIZUKO] This is...

291
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,192
[SHIZUKO] A high‐class sports
club.

292
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,028
[SAKURA] It's just like I
imagined!

293
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,398
[MISAKI] That's a pretty
straightforward name for a gym.

294
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,666
[SHIZUKO] Let's go.

295
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,102
[SAKURA] Yeah!
[MISAKI] I don't like this.

296
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,740
[SAKURA] Whoa! The inside really
lives up to its name!

297
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,275
[MISAKI] He's been coming to a
place like this?

298
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,411
[SHIZUKO] It seems he got off at
the second floor.

299
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,322
[SAKURA] I knew it! He's
definitely the heir to a vast
fortune!

300
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,390
[SHIZUKO] Three visitors'
passes, please.

301
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,225
[RECEPTIONIST] Yes, ma'am.

302
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,930
[SHIZUKO] I wonder where he went
to...

303
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,165
<girls fawning>

304
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,434
[SAKURA] Huh? Isn't that him
over there?

305
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,403
[GIRLS] So handsome!

306
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,605
<fawning>

307
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,747
[SAKURA] Ooh, look! Those girls
are practically swarming all
over him!

308
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,582
[SAKURA] What are you looking
at, Misaki?

309
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,117
Pay attention‐ we can't let Usui
out of our sight!

310
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,386
[MISAKI] You, but that doesn't
mean...!

311
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,591
[SAKURA] Huh? He's already gone.

312
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,025
[SHIZUKO] Both of you, hurry!

313
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,627
[SHIZUKO] Usui has already left.

314
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,428
Quickly, let's wait for him
outside.

315
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,030
[BOTH] Uh, okay.

316
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,500
[MISAKI] So now where are we?

317
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,970
[SHIZUKO] A high‐class,
tailor‐made suit store.

318
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,138
[SAKURA] I was right again? Wow,
I'm really good at this!

319
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,340
[SHIZUKO] Just who is Usui,
exactly?

320
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,778
[SAKURA] I already told you!
He's the heir to vast fortune!

321
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,312
[SHIZUKO] Let's proceed.

322
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,214
[MISAKI] Huh? We're going in?
[SHIZUKO] Of course we are.

323
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,219
[SAKURA] These look so
expensive!

324
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,321
[MISAKI] Jeez, this is the
biggest waste of space

325
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:52,092
I've ever seen. Couldn't they
put out some more product?

326
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,961
[CLERK] Welcome. Is there
something I can help you find?

327
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:55,896
[SAKURA] Uh oh...

328
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:56,797
[SHIZUKO] No, good sir.

329
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,031
We are merely looking‐

330
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,566
we will let you know
if we need any help.

331
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,235
[CLERK] Please let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

332
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,537
[SAKURA] Shizuko, that was
awesome!

333
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:04,805
[MISAKI] You sounded so mature.

334
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,139
[SHIZUKO] Let us continue to
look for Usui.

335
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,075
[MISAKI] Yeah.
[SAKURA] Hey, don't leave me!

336
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,277
[MISAKI] I wonder if they're as
expensive as they look...

337
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,579
[MISAKI] How much is this one
is...?

338
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,647
<cash register>

339
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,748
[MISAKI] Five hundred thousand?!

340
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,149
Is that some kinda joke?!

341
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,184
[SHIZUKO] This section is only
for pre‐made suits.

342
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,154
The custom‐made suits in there
probably cost twice as much.

343
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,424
[MISAKI] I can't believe clothes
this expensive actually exist...

344
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:28,394
[SAKURA] I don't see Usui
anywhere in the store...

345
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,531
[MISAKI] Oh, I know‐ he probably
wandered in her on accident,

346
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:32,666
saw how much these suits cost,
and then took off.

347
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,770
[SHIZUKO] No, it is possible
that he was guided toward the
VIP room.

348
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,004
[BOTH] VIP?!

349
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,847
[SHIZUKO] As I thought... the
VIP room.

350
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:47,914
[BOTH] VIP!

351
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,449
[CLERK] It suits you quite well.

352
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,218
[USUI] I believe it does SUIT me
well, sir.

353
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,554
[CLERK] Understood, sir.

354
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,421
[USUI] Thanks.
[SHIZUKO] He's coming this way.

355
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,964
[MISAKI] The more I find out
about him the more confused I
get...

356
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:04,765
[SHIZUKO] Let's follow him.

357
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,132
[SAKURA] Yay!

358
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:13,940
[MISAKI] What's this?

359
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,509
[SHIZUKO] It appears to
be a restaurant.

360
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:18,044
The name written there says
"Ultra High Class."

361
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,479
[SAKURA] What should I do?

362
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,248
My imagination was right AGAIN!
This is kinda scary!

363
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,217
[MISAKI] Well, since it's a
restaurant,

364
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,687
I guess we can't go in and
follow him anymore, can we?

365
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:27,387
[SHIZUKO] Let's go.

366
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,421
<airhorn>

367
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:29,623
[SAKURA] Oh, we're going in?
Yay!

368
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,591
[MISAKI] Huh?!

369
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,828
[WAITER] Hello‐ would you happen
to have a reservation with us?

370
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,931
[SHIZUKO] It would seem the
other members of our party are
not yet here.

371
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,099
May we wait for them inside?

372
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,266
[WAITER] Of course.

373
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,703
Please, let me show you
to a table.

374
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,445
[MISAKI] Isn't it bad manners
for me to wear a hat inside?

375
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:55,448
[SHIZUKO] It's part of your
outfit, so I doubt they will
even notice.

376
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,885
[WAITER] Shall I bring you some
drink menus?

377
00:16:58,985 --> 00:16:59,853
[SHIZUKO] No, water is fine,
good sir.

378
00:16:59,953 --> 00:17:01,755
[WAITER] Very well.

379
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,625
[MISAKI] I think the person
I've learned the most about
today is you Shizuko‐

380
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,593
I don't think this is a
side of you I've ever
seen before.

381
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,129
[SAKURA] When you do something,
you go all out, dontcha?

382
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,866
[SHIZUKO] Now then, let us
observe Usui.

383
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,301
[SAKURA] Is he waiting for
someone?

384
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,337
[SHIZUKO] He very well could.

385
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,641
It's hard to imagine that one
would eat alone in a high‐class
restaurant such as this.

386
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,309
[SAKURA] Maybe we'll finally
get to see what his
family looks like?

387
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,146
Oh! What if he's waiting
for his secret girlfriend?

388
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,448
[SAKURA] I wonder who it's gonna
be?

389
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,183
[SAKURA] What? What is it,
Misaki?

390
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,893
[SAKURA] Wha‐What? Don't tell
me‐ is that who Usui's been
waiting for?

391
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,295
[SAKURA] She's going over
there...

392
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,434
[SAKURA] Ahh! Look, he just
waved at her! So he really WAS
waiting for a girl!

393
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,704
[SAKURA] Or, at least, it just
looks like that.

394
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:54,841
Even though she's walking
towards his table, there's still
a chance we're wrong.

395
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,610
[SAKURA] We still can't tell for
sure.

396
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,518
[SAKURA] Huh? Look at that...

397
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:06,853
[SAKURA] For some reason I'm
really relieved...

398
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,855
[SHIZUNO] We were completely
fooled.

399
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,123
[SHIZUKO] What is it, Misaki?

400
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,491
[SHIZUKO] Careful, he'll spot
you.

401
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,294
[MISAKI] Sorry, I'm going home.

402
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,234
[MISAKI] I swear... what the
heck am I even doing here?

403
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,335
[SAKURA] Misaki!

404
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,870
[SAKURA] You're really going?

405
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,274
Yeah. I wasn't interested in
Usui's secrets to begin with.

406
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,976
[SHIZUKO] I see. If that's how
you feel,

407
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,411
[SAKURA] Double glasses!
[SHIZUKO] I see.
If that's how you feel,

408
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,113
then perhaps we should
end this here.

409
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,315
<laughing>

410
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,351
[MISAKI] What the heck?!
How is he even running like
that?!

411
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,686
[SAKURA] When did he put on a
kimono?

412
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,921
[SHIZUKO] It would seem
the game is back on‐

413
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:41,755
let us resume our
pursuit!

414
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:42,589
Come on, Misaki!

415
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,590
[MISAKI] Hold on‐!

416
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,797
<laughing>

417
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,634
<excited walla>

418
00:18:53,734 --> 00:18:55,335
<laughing>

419
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,338
[USUI] All clear, go right ahead
ma'am.

420
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:05,679
[SAKURA] Man, I'm beat!

421
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,547
It's gotten so late

422
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,214
I had to take off my sunglasses.

423
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,651
[SHIZUKO] Usui is truly a riddle
wrapped in an enigma.

424
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,754
[SAKURA] Is this the kind of
stuff he does every single day?

425
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,823
[SAKURA] I think I've had enough
for one day. I'm out!

426
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,024
[SHIZUKO] I am as well.

427
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,425
[SAKURA] If you don't mind,

428
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,929
I'll be taking back my super
secret disguise, too!

429
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,097
[SAKURA] See you later, Misaki.

430
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,566
It was actually kinda fun,
wasn't it?

431
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,400
[SHIZUKO] Well then, Misaki,
we'll see you tomorrow.

432
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,103
[SAKURA] Oh! It's faster to cut
through that park over there.

433
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,805
[SHIZUKO] Very well. Let's go.

434
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,643
[MISAKI] I'm so confused...

435
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,815
[MISAKI] Guess I'll head home,
too.

436
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,284
[MISAKI] Usui?

437
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:56,763
<mew>

438
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:57,698
<roar>

439
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:00,200
Owow! Hold on a second!

440
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,937
[MISAKI] Look at you getting
beat up by a cat!

441
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,940
[USUI] For whatever reason,
animals really don't like me.

442
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,643
[USUI] They say animals and
babies know if someone is kind
or not‐

443
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,377
guess they know a stalker when
they see one.

444
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,914
[MISAKI] I know you're kind,
Usui.

445
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:15,616
[MISAKI] You act like you're all
cool and aloof,

446
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,984
but here you are helping a stray
kitten off the street.

447
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,119
[USUI] You sure about that?

448
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,854
Maybe I knew you were
following me

449
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,989
and set this whole thing up to
make myself look good.

450
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,058
[MISAKI] You could've,
but you're not that kind of guy,
right?

451
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,228
Wait a minute!
You knew we were following you
from the start, didn't you?!

452
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:32,766
So you were just dragging us all
across town for your own
personal enjoyment, is that it?!

453
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:35,636
[USUI] With those costumes on
it's not exactly like you'd
blend in, right?

454
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,104
[MISAKI] Don't give me that!
I thought the exact same thing!

455
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,073
[USUI] Still... it was nice
that you showed

456
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,374
an interest
in me for a change.

457
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,643
Guess there's a first time for
everything.

458
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,277
[MISAKI] Wh‐what are you saying?

459
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,580
It's not like I was there
because I wanted to be...

460
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,385
[USUI] If you just ask, I'll
show you everything there is to
know about me.

461
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,987
[USUI] Here. My address is‐

462
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:54,721
[MISAKI] No thanks.

463
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,923
[USUI] Huh?

464
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,792
[MISAKI] No matter how hard
I try I can't figure you out,

465
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:01,161
and I never have any idea what
you're thinking.

466
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,763
[MISAKI] So, yeah, maybe I did
feel like

467
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:06,667
trying to learn a little bit
more about you.

468
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:12,405
[MISAKI] And as a result,
I learned everything about you
that I really needed to know...

469
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,775
[MISAKI] that I could care less
about your private life!

470
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,577
In fact, the less I know the
better!

471
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:18,712
So you're saying that regardless
of my past or my background,

472
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:21,447
that no matter what you love me
for ME, right?

473
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:25,251
[MISAKI] Are you an idiot?!
How could you possibly have
come to that conclusion?!

474
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:26,219
[MISAKI] Just hurry up and go
home!

475
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,353
[USUI] Yeah, yeah.

476
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,522
[MISAKI] And don't
make any stops‐

477
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:29,523
just go straight home.

478
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,791
[USUI] Oh, you can come back

479
00:21:30,891 --> 00:21:32,025
to my house if you'd like,
Miss President.

480
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,926
[MISAKI] No thank you!

481
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:33,894
[USUI] Shoot.

482
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:54,635
[MINAKO] This is Minako Ayuzawa.
Thank you for always looking
after Misaki.

483
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:56,603
[SUZUNA] So this is where you
are, Mom.

484
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,438
[MINAKO] Oh, Suzuna. I forgot to
give Usui a present.

485
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,773
What do you think of this?

486
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:04,210
[SUZUNA] One of the dolls
you paint faces on?

487
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,478
It's the perfect present!

488
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,080
[MISAKI] Huh. I wonder if he'd
like this...

489
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,515
[USUI] Ooh, that's a nice doll.

490
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,716
[MISAKI] Make it a matching set

491
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,618
with this bowl made out
of scrap wood.

492
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,919
[USUI] Ooh, that's a nice bowl.

493
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,487
[MISAKI] Next up is the sports
festival, huh?

494
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,923
[SAKURA] No! Please don't make
me kiss anyone!

495
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:20,093
[MISAKI] It's all right.
I'll protect you, Sakura.
