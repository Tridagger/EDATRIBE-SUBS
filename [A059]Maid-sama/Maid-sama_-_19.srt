1
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,800
[MAKI]
In that case, we will now move
on to the second round of the
footman auditions.

2
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,069
(TORA chuckling)
[MAKI] There is but one
challenge in the second round:

3
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,439
[MAKI]
Please create an appealing table
presentation for afternoon tea.

4
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,109
[BUTLER A] Oh crap‐ I
don't know how to do that!
[MAKI] From the table setting to
the food and drinks,

5
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,177
[BUTLER B] Doesn't the little
fork go on the right?
[MAKI] all choices
are yours to make.

6
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,980
[MAKI] This will of course
require a basic knowledge
of table settings,

7
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,284
but for anything you are
unsure of, please use your
own individual tastes.
[TRIO] Huh?

8
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:02,122
[MAKI] The placement of a single
item can impact your display's
overall appeal.

9
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,791
[MAKI] Your attention to detail
will be key to your success.
Your time limit is 10 minutes.

10
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,260
[MISAKI, thinking]
No matter what they throw at me‐
I WILL save Maid Latte!

11
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,429
[MAKI] Now then, let the second
round begin!

12
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,964
[BUTLER C]
Which ones should we choose?!

13
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,498
[BUTLER D]
Argh, I got no idea!

14
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,801
[MISAKI]
Okay! Let's go, Usui! Gaahhhh!

15
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,869
[USUI]
Hold on a second.

16
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,270
(MISAKI choking)

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,072
[MISAKI]
Are you trying to kill
me or something?!

18
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,007
[USUI]
Who is gonna be having
the afternoon tea?

19
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,375
[MISAKI]
Huh?!

20
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,210
[USUI]
Who will this tea
presentation be for?

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,146
[MISAKI]
Aaahhh... Let's see‐

22
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:30,150
[MISAKI]
It's an elegant afternoon
tea at an English‐style
butler café, so...

23
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,919
[MISAKI]
upper‐class ladies and
married women!

24
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,908
[MISAKI]
Usui, look!

25
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,476
I got one of every cake!

26
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,344
Will this be enough or
should I get more?

27
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,880
[USUI]
Wow, that's a lot.

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,815
This looks more like a buffet
than afternoon tea.

29
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,551
[MISAKI]
I guess... it's not very
"elegant," huh?

30
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,019
[USUI]
Why not use something like this?

31
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,320
[MISAKI]
Oh, that'll do it!

32
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,222
[MAKI]
There are three minutes
remaining.

33
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,291
[MISAKI]
Huh?! W‐we have to hurry
up with the setting!

34
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,926
[USUI] Mind if I do it?

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,997
[MISAKI]
Uh? Sure... but somehow you
seem awfully confident.

36
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,501
[USUI] Scones should be placed
at the bottom of the cake stand.

37
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:23,804
[USUI] Go look for some
jam and clotted cream.
[MISAKI] Clotted?

38
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,674
[USUI] Finger sandwiches
should go on the middle tier.
[MISAKI] F‐Finger?!

39
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:32,746
[USUI] And at the top how about
we place some of those small
desserts you brought over. What
do you think?

40
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,516
[MISAKI]
Let's see‐ how about those
tarts right there?

41
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:38,118
[USUI]
For the tea, we should
definitely go with Earl Grey.

42
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,253
[MISAKI]
Why that one out of
all the others?

43
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,856
[USUI]
Well, because it's standard
for afternoon tea.

44
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,225
[MAKI]
Only 30 seconds remain.

45
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,860
[USUI]
Now for the finishing touch:

46
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,295
[USUI]
Some small flowers to create
a reserved

47
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,934
but elegant presentation.
Now we're done.

48
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:57,437
[JUDGE A]
Hmm... It's quite faithful to an
English‐style afternoon tea,
isn't it?

49
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,272
[JUDGE B]
The cutlery has also been
well polished.

50
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,509
Female customers would likely
appreciate the attention to
detail.

51
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,144
[JUDGE C]
What a splendid table!

52
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:09,650
[MISAKI]
(breath) Incredible! Everything
about it is perfect!

53
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,152
[USUI] Just who do you think I
am?

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,522
[MISAKI]
A mysterious, perverted alien
from Planet Pheromone.

55
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,390
[USUI]
Hmm... Yep, you got it.

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,292
[MISAKI]
No, but really, how do you‐

57
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,361
[MAKI]
We shall now take a short break.

58
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:25,632
[MAKI]
Everyone, please take this
opportunity to enjoy your
respective afternoon teas.

59
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,934
[YUKIMURA]
Didja hear that, Kanou?
We get to eat cake!

60
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,137
[SHIROKAWA]
Kurotatsu, why'd you have to get
so hung up on the presentation?!

61
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,542
[KUROSAKI] Cause presentation's
the most important part!
[SHIROKAWA] Now we don't get to
enjoy the rich people food!

62
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,512
[MISAKI]
Say, Usui... Why did you
come to this audition?

63
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,649
[USUI]
Because being asked by a hot
Internet celebrity made my heart
go a‐flutter?

64
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,251
[MISAKI]
Looks like I'm gonna have to
force it out of you.

65
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:49,590
[USUI] Because wearing a mask
and a suit sounded like fun.
[MISAKI] Sadly, that probably
IS the truth.

66
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,528
[KUROSAKI] We're the ones who
want to sigh, you bastard, you
can't take that away from us!
[SHIROKAWA] You got to grab

67
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,763
[SHIROKAWA] [KUROSAKI]
Pssshhh...

68
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,300
[MISAKI]
Excuse me while I
dispose of this garbage.

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,271
[TORA, thinking]
Even makin' use of a loose
cannon like that, he gets
the job done perfectly.

70
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,941
[TORA, thinking]
That's Usui for ya, all right.

71
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,511
[YUKIMURA] Ah! There he is!

72
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,278
[YUKIMURA]
I thought that was you!

73
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,215
I didn't expect to see you here‐
what a surprise!

74
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,583
[USUI] Who. Are. You?

75
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:21,021
[YUKIMURA]
Eh? Mr. Usui...
That's you... right?

76
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:26,292
[USUI]
My name is Not Usui! I am study
abroad from exotic land of the
ice, the Iceland!

77
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,964
[YUKIMURA] Kanou, there's no
way that's Mr. Usui! He acts
nothing like him!
[USUI] Ha ha ha! You have make

78
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,566
[YUKIMURA]
But they look so much
alike it's crazy!

79
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,934
[KANOU]
Is that right...

80
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,368
[YUKIMURA]
That's incredible, right, Kanou?

81
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,738
I was super surprised!

82
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,240
[KANOU]
I think it's about time
for us to head back.

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,676
[KANOU] We still have
some cake left over.
[YUKIMURA] It would be a
waste to just leave it there!

84
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,111
[MISAKI]
I swear, those idiots
never learn...

85
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,380
[SARASHINA] Shiroyan!
Kurotatsu!

86
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,052
(MISAKI groaning)

87
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:02,896
[MISAKI] Ow!

88
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,931
[TORA] Hm? (chuckle)

89
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,835
(TORA laughing)

90
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,604
[USUI]
You sure were gone a long time.

91
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,607
[MISAKI]
Yeah. I was going to the
restroom when I saw HIM,

92
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,610
so I went into the men's room.

93
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,112
[USUI]
Why are you in such a bad mood?

94
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,281
Is it because I called you
"flat as a board" in front
of everyone?

95
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
[USUI]
Would you have preferred if I'd
said something like,

96
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,520
"Wow, look at these
rippling pecs"
[MISAKI] Who said anything
about that?!

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,422
[USUI]
Or did going into the men's
restroom make you so nervous you
couldn't "perform"?

98
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,959
[MISAKI]
(panic) Don't talk about
stuff like that, you stupid
pervert!

99
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,431
[MISAKI] (breath)

100
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,266
[MISAKI]
Eh. What the heck? Let go of me!

101
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,603
[BUTLERS] (noticing)
[YUKIMURA] (nervous)
[BUTLER A] What's that? A fight?

102
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,705
[MISAKI]
If anyone's in a
bad mood it's YOU.

103
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,641
Maybe. Do you know why that is?

104
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,177
[MISAKI]
I‐I think I do.

105
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,116
[USUI]
I see. Then... let's make up.

106
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,990
[USUI] If you act too reckless,
I'll have to punish you, Misaki.

107
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,961
[MISAKI] Huh!? (stammering)

108
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,431
[MISAKI]
This isn't some peep show! I get
it, Usui, so get away from me!

109
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,834
[USUI]
I'm so happy you get it,
MISTER Misaki.

110
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,570
[MISAKI] Oh, shut up!
I said I get it already,
[YUKIMURA] It seems like
they're still disagreeing about

111
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,872
[MISAKI] so hurry
up and get away!
[YUKIMURA] something, but at
least they're not fighting,

112
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,741
[MISAKI] And quit grinning
at me like that, you pervert!
[KANOU] Indeed.

113
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,576
[MAKI]
Attention contestants‐
we shall now

114
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,845
begin the third round of
the footman auditions.

115
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,448
[MISAKI]
Usui... I... I'll try my best
not to do anything too reckless

116
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:34,555
but I'm still going to... I'm
going to‐! I'm gonna give this
my all to the very end.

117
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,027
[ERIKA]
Aoi! Subaru! Over here!

118
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,164
[SATSUKI] That looked tough!
Are you all right?
[SUBARU] We're fine.

119
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,733
[SATSUKI]
Aoi! What were you thinking,
going off and doing something so
reckless like that‐!

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:52,138
[AOI] Yeah, yeah. Enough with
the lecturing already.
[SATSUKI] I swear! Ugghhhhh!

121
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,308
[AOI]
I couldn't just sit by and watch
as your shop got bought out by
some weirdos

122
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:59,880
who showed up outta
nowhere could I?
To top it off, they want to
turn it into a BUTLER café‐

123
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,115
[SATSUKI]
That's so sweet, Aoi.

124
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,786
[AOI]
That would just interfere with
my plans to remodel the shop and
make it cuter!

125
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,655
[SATSUKI]
Aoi, are you... plotting
to take over Maid Latte?

126
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,291
Anyway, SHE'S the one
who's being reckless.

127
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,727
[AOI]
What's that weird girl thinking?

128
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,665
[MISAKI, thinking]
Good... Looks like Aoi and
Subaru found the others
without a problem.

129
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,169
[MISAKI, thinking]
I know what I'm doing
is irresponsible...

130
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,040
[MISAKI, thinking]
But even so...
I can't turn back now.

131
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,711
[MISAKI]
This whole thing...
it's my fault.

132
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,081
[USUI]
Whoa. It really stayed in there.

133
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,918
[MISAKI]
We're not here to play around,
stupid Usui!

134
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,320
[MISAKI]
What is this thing? "49"?

135
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,191
[MAKI]
At this time all contestants
should have received a slip of
paper with a number on it.

136
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,894
[MAKI]
One member from each pair should
have drawn one card,

137
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,263
[MAKI]
which will be your order
for the next judging.

138
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,333
[MAKI]
The final round will simulate
customer interaction.

139
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,603
[MAKI]
For this challenge, the judges
shall act as your customers.

140
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,841
[MAKI]
Though you may be nervous, we
will be looking for grace and
refinement above all else.

141
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:06,012
[MAKI]
How well will you be able to
think on your feet and play the
part of a full‐fledged footman?

142
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,949
[MAKI]
This will be the most
important test of all.

143
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,484
[MAKI]
With that said, good luck
and do your best.

144
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:16,389
[MISAKI]
We lost one pair when both our
partners got cut, so I guess
this means we're last.

145
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,925
[YUKIMURA] Mr. Not Usui
[MISAKI] Gah! Get out of here,
Yukimura!

146
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,062
[YUKIMURA] This sure is scary
huh? We got number one so we're
first!
[MISAKI] If he sees my face up

147
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,764
[MISAKI] Unh...

148
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,700
[MISAKI] Usui...

149
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:34,841
(collapsing on floor)

150
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,977
[BUTLER H] Hey, are you okay?
[BUTLER B] Is he awake?

151
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,212
[BUTLER D] Hang in
there, you two!
[BUTLER K] Hey!

152
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,814
(MISAKI gasps)

153
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,349
[MISAKI] Oh?

154
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:09,710
[MISAKI]
Usui! Hey, Usui! Usui! Usui!

155
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,878
[MISAKI] (worried)

156
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,584
[USUI] Are you hurt?

157
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:19,019
[MISAKI] No, I... I'm fine.

158
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:23,089
[USUI]
If you're fine, then
I'm fine... Misaki.

159
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,759
[JUDGE A]
You there! Just stay put‐

160
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,594
we'll have someone look at you.

161
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,395
[USUI]
I'm all right, really.

162
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:30,797
[MISAKI]
There's no way!

163
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,366
Not after you protected me
from a fall like that!

164
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,468
[MISAKI] There's no way
you aren't injured!
[USUI] Argh...

165
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,270
[MISAKI] (shocked)

166
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,940
[USUI] Misaki...

167
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,475
[USUI]
Everyone from the shop is
looking on in concern.

168
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:45,411
[USUI]
If you're all right, then how
about you give them a wave?

169
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:49,883
[MISAKI]
But you... Your arm...

170
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,052
[MAKI]
Do you think you are
well enough to continue?

171
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,555
If there is any concern,
I can call a doctor.

172
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,690
That won't be necessary.

173
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,726
(TORA chuckles)

174
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:06,700
[YUKIMURA]
W‐Wel... W‐w‐welcome back,
M‐ister M‐Masher!

175
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,705
[MAKI]
Next up, pair Number 49.

176
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,074
[USUI]
Looks like it's
finally our turn.

177
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,276
[MISAKI, thinking]
The way he reacted...

178
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,445
[MISAKI, thinking]
His left arm must
really be hurting.

179
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:22,883
[MISAKI, thinking]
And then... there's
his right wrist, too...

180
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,052
[MISAKI, thinking]
Is it okay? Should I really let
him go through with this?

181
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:30,056
[MISAKI, thinking]
But... if I back down now...
(determined)

182
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,325
[MAKI]
The judging shall now begin.

183
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:36,162
For this round, I, Maki, shall
act both as customer and judge.

184
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,363
I look forward to it.

185
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,265
[MISAKI]
Thank you very much,
it's our pleasure.

186
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,069
[AOI]
It's started. Figures they get
that squinty‐eyed judge.

187
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,872
[SATSUKI]
This is going to be the last
challenge, isn't it?

188
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:48,842
I just don't want anything
else happen to them.

189
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,477
Please let those two
come out of this safely

190
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,046
[MISAKI] Welcome back, Master.

191
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,248
[MISAKI]
Please allow me to
take your bag for you.

192
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,183
[USUI] And your coat as well.
(Zoom!)

193
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,219
[MISAKI]
Allow to take that as well!

194
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,421
[USUI]
Allow me to show you to your
seat.

195
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:04,591
[MISAKI, thinking]
Good... I'll let Usui handle the
explanations

196
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,027
and I'll handle the
hard stuff myself.

197
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:12,032
[MISAKI, thinking]
Usui's arms are injured because
of me‐ I can't burden him
anymore than I already have!

198
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,701
[USUI]
Yes, Master‐ how
may we assist you?

199
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,737
[MAKI]
I think I'm ready
to enjoy my dinner...

200
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,739
[MISAKI]
Yes, sir! Right away! Zoom!

201
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,741
[MAKI] Also, you there.
[MISAKI] Huh?!

202
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,242
[MAKI]
If you would be so kind,

203
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:24,645
please bring me 10 or so of
those books over yonder.

204
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,413
[USUI] Underst‐
[MISAKI] Here you are, Master!
(heavy breathing)

205
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,116
[MAKI]
Forgive my intrusion, but I
couldn't help but notice...

206
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,719
[MAKI]
Are you attempting to
cover for your partner?

207
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,589
[MISAKI] Ulp!
[MAKI] Would there perhaps
be a reason for that?

208
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:39,459
[MAKI]
As in, you're trying to
avoid letting him carry
something heavy?

209
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:42,062
[MAKI]
My apologies.

210
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,565
I suppose I am merely being
a meddlesome customer.

211
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:48,935
[MAKI]
But if I am indeed correct...
then perhaps it would be best
if he was excused for the day?

212
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:54,908
[MISAKI, thinking] Oh, no!
[USUI] Master, you honor me
with your kindness. Thank you
for your concern.

213
00:12:55,008 --> 00:13:00,413
[USUI]
But if we as butlers cannot
fulfill our Masters' orders,
then we serve no purpose, do we?

214
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,316
[USUI]
Please feel free to ask
anything of me.

215
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,753
[MISAKI, thinking]
All I've done... is make
things even harder on him!

216
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:12,726
[MAKI]
So then you're certain there
isn't some other reason? Would
you happen to be injured?

217
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:17,463
Not at all, my associate is
merely being diligent so that
I might perform a more important
task for you.

218
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:20,133
[MISAKI] Huh?
[MAKI] (confused)

219
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:22,769
[USUI]
With your permission,
Master, I shall now proceed.

220
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,170
[MAKI] Hmmm...

221
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,073
[MISAKI] Gahhhh!

222
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,409
[MAKI]
So this is the "task"
that you spoke of.

223
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,345
[MISAKI, thinking]
He can play the violin?
That's news to me!

224
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:36,016
But with his hand like that...
he can't possibly play!

225
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,861
[BUTLER E] Awesome!

226
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,596
[BUTLER F] I wish I could do
that...

227
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:07,614
[MAKI]
I see. Playing the violin is
a splendid "task" indeed.

228
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,483
I'm sure it will make my meal
that much more enjoyable.

229
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,954
[MAKI]
Please allow me to enjoy
this a little longer.

230
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,106
[MISAKI, thinking]
His face is looking more and
more pained.

231
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:38,779
[ERIKA]
Misa and Usui's round seems like
it's going on forever.

232
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,346
[SATSUKI] (nervous)

233
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,950
[MISAKI, thinking]
The whole reason I came
here was because

234
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,587
I wanted to protect the shop...
and the people in it...

235
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:52,125
[MISAKI, thinking]
I wanted to protect it,
no matter what the cost! But...

236
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,965
[MISAKI]
That's enough.

237
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:03,236
[MISAKI] Just stop it!
(music ends)

238
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,076
Oh, is something the matter?

239
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,478
[MISAKI]
My humblest apologies!

240
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,081
The truth is both of his arms
are seriously injured.

241
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:19,052
[MISAKI]
I believe he must receive
medical attention at once!

242
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,421
You there...
Is this indeed the truth?

243
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,890
[MISAKI]
You can see it, can't you?
He's obviously in pain‐

244
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,560
[MAKI] And yet... he said
nothing of it, did he?
(MISAKI gasps)

245
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,062
[MAKI]
Meaning that, regardless of his
injuries,

246
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,798
he is determined to fulfill
his duties no matter what, yes?

247
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:34,601
[MAKI]
He may be in pain, but for you
to take his work away

248
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,838
in front of his Master is
nothing short of disgraceful.

249
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:42,208
[MAKI] It would seem to me that
your relationship is lacking in
trust.
(MISAKI angry)

250
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,145
[MISAKI]
At your shop, "looking out
for one another"...

251
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:49,650
may mean sitting back and
watching as your comrades
push themselves until they
collapse...

252
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,787
But at our shop, we look out
for one another so that we DON'T
collapse.

253
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,290
[MISAKI]
It's because they support
me that I want to support
them, too!

254
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,861
[MISAKI]
The reason I've made it this far
is because, even though I cause
them trouble,

255
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,196
they've supported
me every step of the way.

256
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,599
[MISAKI]
Because this is
that kind of shop,

257
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:11,638
we can give our all to the
customers in order to put them
at ease and make them happy.

258
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:17,410
That's the kind of thoughtful
place it is, and I love it from
the bottom of my heart.

259
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,046
[MISAKI]
Now, if you'll please excuse us.

260
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,481
[SATSUKI]
Misa! Usui!

261
00:16:21,582 --> 00:16:23,416
[MISAKI]
Someone! Please call
a taxi right away!

262
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:25,786
We have to get him
to a hospital quickly!

263
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,654
[ERIKA]
Okay! Hold on!

264
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,889
[AOI] They're all swollen!

265
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,557
[SATSUKI]
I'll wet down a handkerchief.

266
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,058
[MISAKI] Manager!

267
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,595
[MISAKI] I'm sorry.

268
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:39,933
[SATSUKI]
Misa, if Maid Latte changed or
moved to some faraway place...

269
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,870
[SATSUKI]
...what would you do?

270
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:50,310
[MISAKI]
Manager... If I thought you
needed me... I'd go anywhere!
I mean it.

271
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,048
[SATSUKI]
Thank you, Misa. You have no
idea how happy that makes me.

272
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:02,388
[TORA]
What gives? Why're you standin'
there in the dark like that?

273
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,126
[TORA]
And quit makin' that face‐
we're in public y'know.

274
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:10,363
[MAKI]
I built up an idea in my head
of how butlers and footmen
should behave...

275
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:14,601
and accepted no compromise
from my employees in regards
to my vision.

276
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,539
[MAKI]
I believed if we faithfully
recreated the English
class‐based society,

277
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:22,075
the customers would surely
be pleased, but...

278
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,278
[TORA]
You lost your way 'cuz
of what that girl said?

279
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,750
Hmph. You sure are a handful,
you know that? Well...

280
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,285
[TORA]
There's another location.
It's prime real estate.

281
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,188
[MAKI]
Huh? You don't mean the
Igarashi Conglomerate's...!

282
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:39,593
[TORA]
It's my land to do whatever
I want with. There'll be no
problem.

283
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:45,298
[TORA] 'Sides‐ lettin' their
shop go on the way it is will
probably be much more
interestin', don't you think?

284
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,900
[MAKI]
Thank you very much, sir!

285
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,503
[TORA]
I'll leave the rest up to you.

286
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,711
[TRIO] (in awe of AOI)

287
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,547
[AOI]
Hey, those three idiots are
being even creepier than usual.

288
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,849
[SATSUKI] (overjoyed)
[AOI] (shock) Yeesh, she's
making the same face!

289
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,518
[SUBARU]
It's to be expected, Aoi.

290
00:18:04,618 --> 00:18:07,988
After all Maid Latte just
overcame its greatest
challenge yet.

291
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,823
[AOI] Yeah, but still...

292
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,457
[AOI]
Could you explain a bit?

293
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,960
Why'd those guys suddenly drop
their buyout deal for?

294
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,996
[SUBARU]
Didn't the manager tell you?

295
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,432
Mr. Maki decided it would be
better to build his shop in
another location‐ lucky us!

296
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:24,370
If he was just gonna build it
somewhere else then why'd he
even come after us in the first
place?! Huh?

297
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,339
[AOI]
Say, where's SHE at?

298
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,575
[SUBARU] "She"?
[SATSUKI] Misa, of course!

299
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,511
[AOI] You're finally talking
normally!
(SATSUKI giggling)

300
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,547
[SATSUKI]
Right now, I'm sure
Misa is with him.

301
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,083
[MISAKI] (freaked out)

302
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,019
What is this place?!

303
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,122
[USUI] It's my house.
[MISAKI] Yeah... I'm not sure
if I really believe you...

304
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,824
[USUI]
What's this? A visit?

305
00:18:43,924 --> 00:18:45,291
[MISAKI]
S‐Something like that.

306
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,827
[MISAKI]
Where are your parents?

307
00:18:46,927 --> 00:18:49,262
[USUI] Not here. I live alone.

308
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,632
[MISAKI] Th‐thanks
for letting me in.
(cat hissing)

309
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:55,001
[MISAKI]
You didn't... just
move here, right?

310
00:18:55,101 --> 00:19:01,675
[USUI]
I've lived here since I started
school. You shouldn't have come
here alone.

311
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:04,911
[USUI]
Now I can do anything I
want to, huh?

312
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:11,918
[MISAKI]
(angry) I knew it! You have a
fever! It's true, you left the
hospital way too soon!

313
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:15,789
[USUI] Huh?
[MISAKI] Look, just go lay
down! I'm getting a towel and
some water.

314
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,023
[USUI]
I'm fine, really.

315
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,725
[MISAKI]
I said, go lay down!

316
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,293
[USUI]
Ayuzawa, really I'm‐

317
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,163
[MISAKI]
Don't make me say it
again, stupid Usui!

318
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:29,469
[MISAKI]
Please... let me take
care of you for once.

319
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,941
[MISAKI]
Shouldn't we try and get
a hold of your parents?

320
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,409
[USUI]
Don't worry about it.

321
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,311
[MISAKI]
Why'd you leave the
hospital so soon?

322
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,046
[USUI]
Being sick is boring.

323
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,549
[MISAKI]
Are you at least
eating properly?

324
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:44,651
(MISAKI sighing)

325
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:49,956
[USUI]
This rice has been boiled
so much that it's turned
into rice soup.

326
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:52,325
[USUI] President,
your cooking is‐
[MISAKI] I know, it's bad!

327
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:55,195
[MISAKI] Got a problem?!
Fine, don't eat it! I'll
eat it all myself!
[USUI] I'll eat it.

328
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,132
[USUI]
But it's hard to hold things in
my right hand, so you'll have to
feed me.

329
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:02,769
[USUI] Also, I'm sensitive to
hot foods, so you'll have to
blow on it.

330
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,606
(MISAKI blowing on food)

331
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,713
[USUI]
Isn't this touching...

332
00:20:12,813 --> 00:20:16,550
[USUI]
I didn't know it was possible
to kill the flavor with your
cooking style.

333
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,484
[MISAKI]
Shut up! Just eat it!

334
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,787
[MISAKI]
Despite your complaining,
you ate the whole thing.

335
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:25,559
[USUI]
How could I leave any
behind? You cooked that
meal just for me.

336
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,263
[MISAKI]
Eh... Your clothes are all
sweaty, you should change.

337
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:33,700
[MISAKI]
Oh, it'll be hard to undo
the buttons with that hand,
so let me.

338
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,147
[MISAKI]
Hey... What are you looking at?!

339
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,782
[USUI]
You look like a scowling
delinquent.

340
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:50,884
[MISAKI]
Shut up! Just look out the
window or something!

341
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,152
[USUI] Yeah, yeah.

342
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,855
[MISAKI, thinking]
I owe this guy again...

343
00:20:54,955 --> 00:20:58,424
[MISAKI, thinking]
He makes you think he's just
some trash‐talking, sexually
harassing, no‐good weirdo...

344
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:04,998
[MISAKI, thinking]
but when it counts, he always
comes to help me. But I haven't
done anything for him at all...

345
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,834
[MISAKI]
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:12,272
[MISAKI]
I feel like... I rely
on you for everything.

347
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,609
[MISAKI]
I came here to try and pay you
back for everything you've
done...

348
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,311
but I just screwed things up.

349
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:24,484
[MISAKI]
In the end, I can't do
anything for you at all.
I'm completely... useless.

350
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,928
[USUI]
You're a cruel girl... Ayuzawa.

351
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:38,031
[MISAKI]
(stammer) H‐How?!

352
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,003
[USUI]
You do realize that I
rely on you, too ...

353
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,305
[MISAKI] Liar!
[USUI] It's true.

354
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,874
[USUI]
You're just right
for me, Ayuzawa.

355
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,577
[MISAKI]
(embarrassed) "Just right"?

356
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,947
What the heck is that
supposed to mean? Quit
being stupid, Usui.

357
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:58,051
[MISAKI]
(swoon) What is this?

358
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,856
[MISAKI]
Dammit. You piss me off.

359
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,192
[USUI]
That's why I said you're
cruel, President.

360
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:09,229
[MISAKI] Why's that?!
[USUI] I can't be responsible
for what happens.

361
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,964
[MISAKI] What are you talking
about?!

362
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,268
[YUKIMURA]
Hey, Kanou, why are YOU the only
one who passed the audition?!

363
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,338
[KANOU] Who knows?
[YUKIMURA] I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

364
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,840
[KANOU] Who knows?

365
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:54,868
[YUKIMURA] Is that Mr. Usui over
there? Or is it Mr. "Not Usui"?
[USUI] What is it, Yukimura?

366
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:58,004
[YUKIMURA]
Oh! It IS Mr. Usui. Actually, I
have a favor to ask.

367
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,574
[MISAKI]
Yukimura, are you sure you want
to ask this pervert for a favor?

368
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:03,677
[YUKIMURA]
But I want to do something "big
brotherly" for my little sister.

369
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:06,112
[USUI]
Haha! I am Mr. Not Usui!

370
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,382
[YUKIMURA]
Huh? That was sudden.
Where'd Mr. Usui go? Huh?!

371
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,184
[MISAKI]
Just help him out, Usui.

372
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,654
[AOI]
Next time, Aoi the Internet
celebrity will film a music
video.

373
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:19,526
[USUI & YUKIMURA] Yaay! Aoi!
[MISAKI] So Yukimura and Aoi
are gonna get their own stories
huh?
