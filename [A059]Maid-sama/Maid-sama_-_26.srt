1
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:39,432
[MISAKI'S GHOST] Continuing from
where we left off last time,
everyone's at the Yumesaki
Cultural Festival...

2
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,335
[USUI]
This place is ridiculously
crowded. Let's go somewhere
else.

3
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,538
[MISAKI]
E‐easier said than done.

4
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,107
[MISAKI]
I came to this festival because
I was worried about Sakura,

5
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:51,444
so it makes no sense that we'd
get separated, but it would make
even less sense to go home.

6
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,014
[YUKIMURA]
Maybe there are other students
from our school here, too.

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,016
[KANOU] Maybe.
[MISAKI] It can't be helped.

8
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,118
I just have to kill time with
Usui until the show finishes.

9
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,486
[ICHIROU]
That grilled squid was great!
[JIROU] It WAS really great.

10
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,288
[SABUROU] What do we eat next?
[SHIROU GOROU] Chicken nuggets!

11
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:03,790
[ICHIROU JIROU] Okay, let's go!

12
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,359
[MISAKI] (sigh) There're way
too many people here!

13
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,829
[USUI] Yeah. Chomp chomp.

14
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,363
[MISAKI] SHOCK!

15
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,365
[MISAKI]
How did you get all
that stuff so fast?!

16
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,501
[USUI] For some reason people
just started giving me things.

17
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,302
[USUI] They were like,
"Here, try this."

18
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,038
[MISAKI] "For some reason"?!
There's gotta be another reason!

19
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
[USUI]
Well, maybe it's because... I
made the flowers bloom again!

20
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,778
[MISAKI] Uh...
[USUI] Oh, jeez. Not again.
Let's get out of here.

21
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,212
[MISAKI] Wahhhh!

22
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,482
(Girls gushing over Usui)

23
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,652
[GIRL]
Huh? Where'd the hottie go?

24
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:36,189
[MISAKI] I don't understand...
but don't make anymore flowers
bloom okay?

25
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,191
Is that some kind
of magic trick?

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,727
Huh? I don't really think
it's a magic trick, more
of an illusion.

27
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,663
Whatever it is,
what are they for?!

28
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,364
Huh? A sense of rivalry?

29
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,832
[MISAKI] Rivalry with what?!

30
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:47,433
Come on, stop being so angry.

31
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,670
Why don't you eat something‐
it'll make you feel better.

32
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,506
(breath) Thanks but no thanks,
I don't need any‐

33
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,740
[USUI] Here.

34
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,477
It's pretty tasty.

35
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,217
Well? How is it?

36
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,388
(mumbling) It's good.

37
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,525
[MISAKI, thinking] This is
weird. It's just like‐‐

38
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,293
[USUI] You were thinking it's
like a date. Right?

39
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,728
[MISAKI] Uh?
[USUI] That looks good on you.

40
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,730
You were reading my mind
again, weren't you?

41
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,131
You perverted alien!

42
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,133
What's with those superhuman
abilities of yours?!

43
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:25,772
Of making flowers bloom,
reading people's minds...
Just who or WHAT, are you, huh?!

44
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,907
(laughing)

45
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,609
Wha? Why are
you laughing?!

46
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,377
[USUI] Sorry. But you...
[MISAKI] Huh?

47
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,347
You were thinking the exact
same thing that I was.

48
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,721
[USUI] Where are you going?

49
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,022
[MISAKI] Uh‐ SOMEWHERE.

50
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,791
It's a festival, so I can't
just keep sitting around.

51
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,726
[USUI] I see.

52
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,298
[ICHIROU] We ate almost
everything, huh?
[JIROU] We sure did.

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,667
[SABUROU] Now to check out the
events.

54
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,301
[SHIROU]
What's this "Haunted Mansion"?

55
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,703
[JIROU]
Let's go see how
haunted it really is!

56
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,971
[ICHIROU] Let's go!

57
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,674
Suzuna, did you ever win that
game you were going for?

58
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,342
Yep, I won with a
single postcard.

59
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,677
That's awesome!

60
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,679
I wonder if they have a
sweepstakes club here.

61
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,681
[FRIEND B] I highly doubt it.
[FRIEND A] Let's find some
more food.

62
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,550
[YUKIMURA]
Kanou, should we have
some chicken nuggets?

63
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,317
[KANOU]
That sounds good to me.

64
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,253
[YOUNG SIS] Froggie...

65
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,521
[BIG SIS] Yeah, a big froggie.

66
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,858
[MISAKI]
Dammit! My face is
STILL burning.

67
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:20,193
[GIRL A]
We have the perfect
event for you two.

68
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,795
It's called the Love Trial!

69
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,197
The bounds of your love will be
put to the ultimate test!

70
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,932
Y‐you've got it all wrong, we're
not like that‐

71
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,467
[GIRL]
The rules are simple!

72
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,536
The two of you follow
a set course,

73
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,072
and at each check point one of
you will take on a challenge!

74
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,508
[BOY]
If you can't clear one of the
stages, then you're out!

75
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,578
But if you clear ALL stages and
finish the game...

76
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,446
you'll be treated to
an ultra‐special event
after the festival.

77
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,248
[GIRL] However!
[STUDENTS] Amazing! Whoa!

78
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,885
[GIRL] You can't let go of
each other's hands till you
reach the goal.

79
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:49,189
Now then, what kind of trials
can you two overcome to stay
together?!

80
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,091
Are you up for the challenge?

81
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:51,958
[USUI] We'll do it.

82
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:52,926
What?!

83
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,360
Are you serious?!

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,996
If we want to be together...

85
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,599
we have to "attempt the
great challenge that
awaits," remember?

86
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,266
[USUI] Let's give it a try.

87
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,569
[ERIKA]
You are fire and water, with
the worst of compatibility.

88
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,606
Don't tell me you're
still worried about
that fortune‐telling?

89
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:08,575
I just want to try taking
on a big challenge
together, that's all.

90
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,211
[STUDENTS]
Thank you for accepting
and good luck!

91
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,515
[MISAKI]
I swear. How can you waste money
on something like this?

92
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:19,152
For the price on one coin we
have the wealth of an experience
that will last a life time.

93
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,587
Whatever you say...

94
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,222
If you think about it,
we're getting a good deal.

95
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,824
[USUI] Oh, that's right.
Take your ribbon off.

96
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,292
This is our proof of
participation. Make
sure it's visible.

97
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,461
[MISAKI]
Why do I have to put it on?

98
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,096
[USUI] Because it will look
best on you.

99
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:31,965
[MISAKI] Uuuh.

100
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,870
[USUI]
Apparently, you get to
keep this when we're done.

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,006
See? It isn't a total
waste after all.

102
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,844
Besides, it's good to have
fun once in a while, isn't it?
Also...

103
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:47,047
If you keep scowling like that,
you'll get wrinkles.

104
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,449
Well, let's get going!

105
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,951
[MISAKI]
Stupid Usui!

106
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:51,885
You're such a‐

107
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,253
[USUI] I know.

108
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,724
You absolutely... hate me...
isn't that right?

109
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,025
[MISAKI] Uh...

110
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,866
[MISAKI]
Don't say things like
that... stupid Usui.

111
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,702
[SHIZUKO]
I am leaving now.

112
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,336
[SAKURA, whining]
Shizuko!

113
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,072
[MC]
Up next is a short skit

114
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:14,274
by the famous second‐year duo,
Kamiyama and Ohno!

115
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,376
[KAMIYAMA] I'm Kamiyama!
[OHNO] I'm Ohno.

116
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,379
[BOTH]
Together, we're the Rarr!
Go‐Go‐Go, Run Ma‐Ma‐Ma‐Ma
Aaaargh! Badda‐bing, badda‐‐

117
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,347
This skit is
TERRIBLE, Sakura!

118
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,883
Hey, that's not my fault!

119
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,485
Just how much longer
till Yumemishi comes out?

120
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,453
Um, about two more hours?

121
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,791
[SHIZUKO] Good. Then that means
I have 2 hours to lecture you.
[SAKURA] Shizuko!

122
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,960
Why do we have to wait so long
to see a ridiculous concert?

123
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,730
[SHIZUKO] Ugh. At this rate, I
think it's probably for the best

124
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,866
that we got separated from
Misaki and Usui when we did.

125
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,267
I'm sorry...

126
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,905
[MISAKI, thinking]
Why did things have
to turn out like this?

127
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,809
Why? Why do I have to hold
his hand for this game? Unhh...

128
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,310
[USUI] It's like a date, right?

129
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,344
(Heart beat)

130
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,779
[MISAKI] Uh! No!

131
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,648
I came here with Sakura and
Shizuko,

132
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,717
so why did this have to
happen‐?! Uunnnhhh!

133
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,418
[GIRL]
Okay, are you two ready to go?!

134
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,153
[BOY]
Love Trial... Start now!

135
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,890
What's the matter? We only have
10 minutes to do this, remember?

136
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,727
[USUI]
Try not to hold me back too
much, Miss President.

137
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,262
[MISAKI]
Who's holding who back?!

138
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,633
I'm so sick of this
competitive attitude of
yours I could scream!

139
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,069
Hrm? This may not be our
school, but it's not good to
run in the halls, you know.

140
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,672
[Misaki] Shut up! It's a race!
[USUI] THIS is how you run a
race.

141
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,440
[MISAKI]
The floor's too smooth.
This feels weird!

142
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,343
[YUKIMURA]
We haven't seen that many people
we know, have we, Kanou?

143
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,878
[KANOU] Indeed.

144
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,379
[GIRL] Hrm. What's that
strange sound? Aahah!

145
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,648
[MISAKI] Here's our proof of
participation!

146
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,282
Aah, I can't believe
that took 3 minutes.

147
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,952
It would have only taken
a minute if I had done it
by myself.

148
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,055
Oh yeah! Well if I'd been by
myself, it only would've taken
me 30 seconds!

149
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:38,191
[USUI] We're ready to hear the
rules of the game.
[MISAKI] Raharhaharahra!

150
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,828
[GIRL] Here you go! Please eat
this in 10 minutes or less!

151
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,030
[MISAKI] Jeez, between the two
of us, this will be no problem‐

152
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,966
[FEMALE 26D] However, only one
person can eat it. Hm.

153
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,801
[USUI]
I'm sensing a bit of hostility.

154
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,970
All the boys manage to clear it
just in the nick of time.

155
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,639
Do your best for
your girlfriend.
[MISAKI] Let's do
rock‐paper‐scissors.

156
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,109
What, you're not gonna say
something like "Oh, I can't
eat this" and make me do it?

157
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,178
What? Why the heck would I?

158
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,880
[MISAKI] One, two, three.

159
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,016
Fine by me, I won't let a single
drop of that soup go to waste!

160
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,118
Huh?

161
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,387
Excuse me, but is it okay
if I change hands...?

162
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,989
[GIRL]
You'll be disqualified!

163
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,457
Eh... Fine, I'll
just use my left hand then‐

164
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,094
[USUI]
Then I guess my role...
is to do THIS.

165
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:16,429
I'll feed you, so make sure
you savor every last bite.

166
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,732
[MISAKI]
Th‐That's not necessary!
I can eat it myself! Give
me those chopsticks!

167
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,233
[USUI]
I think we're ready to begin.

168
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,935
[GIRL]
Let's go! One, two...

169
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,204
[GIRLS]
Chinese noodles! Fat noodles!
You're all salty noodles!

170
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,271
[GIRL] Let the game begin!

171
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,508
[USUI] Here. Say "Aah."

172
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,411
[USUI]
If you don't hurry, you won't be
able to eat it in 10 minutes.

173
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,647
[BOY] For once the
girl is trying it!
[GIRL] Good luck to you!

174
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,081
[USUI] You want me to blow on
it first?

175
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,983
N‐No! I can eat it as‐is!

176
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,821
[MISAKI, thinking]
Calm down‐ getting embarrassed
would be just what Usui wants!

177
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,224
[USUI] Huh? President, you're
BAD at this.

178
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,561
Look, look! It's right here.
See? Looksie, looksie!

179
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,030
It's over here! Right here!
C'mon now, President!

180
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,198
[BOY A]
Hey, I hear something
awesome's goin' on.

181
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,835
[BOY B]
Class 3‐1's ramen shop?
Oh, you mean that special
competition right?

182
00:08:54,935 --> 00:09:00,707
[BOY A]
Yeah. Apparently, one couple
is eating with full‐on,
superhuman strength!

183
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:03,243
[BOY C]
Next up is Class 3‐2's
card game, right?

184
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,479
That second‐ year Ikumi is
second‐to‐none at Speed,

185
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,349
but that devil girl defeated
him in no time flat!

186
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,586
[IKUMI]
Yeah, it was the devil I tell
you! She really was the devil!

187
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,420
[BOY A]
The next thing was
even more awesome!

188
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,356
[BOY B]
Class 3‐3's ping pong, right?

189
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:18,992
[BOY D] Normally, if you
can't use your good hand,
you'd be on the defensive...

190
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,961
[MISAKI] Hyaaa!

191
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,062
[BOTH] What?!

192
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,164
[BOY A] Wait, so that girl's
NOT left‐handed?

193
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,900
I'm glad we won, but for
some reason I couldn't get
up to my usual strength...

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,035
[USUI]
The "'Cuz I'm right‐handed"
excuse, is it?

195
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:31,271
[MISAKI]
No! I just don't feel well!
[USUI] Huh.

196
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:35,008
[BOY C] That... That's no
normal couple. They're like...

197
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,477
[ALL]
Some sort of "super" couple!

198
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,613
[BOY]
Welcome to the Balloon Quiz!

199
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,915
First, you must find the
balloon marked "Winner."

200
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:46,452
When you find it, pop it open,
take out the question inside and
answer it as quickly as
possible.

201
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,321
You have five minutes.
And... Start!

202
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,591
[MISAKI] I have the feeling
we're being made into some kind
of spectacle.

203
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,926
[USUI] Maybe we're
standing out too much.

204
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,495
[USUI]
I wonder if the distraction
is necessary anymore...

205
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,063
Huh? Did you say something?

206
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,899
[USUI] Not really.
[MISAKI] Smoosh!

207
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,934
It's a race, to see which of us
can find the winning balloon.

208
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,837
Interesting.
I accept your challenge!

209
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,742
[MISAKI] Uuhh... Whoa!
Uh, Usui, look, I already‐!

210
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:13,413
Found... it..,

211
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:17,017
Wh‐what're you just standing
there for? We have a time limit,
so hurry up and‐

212
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,652
Oh, that's right.

213
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,053
Eh?

214
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:20,787
We have to...

215
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,723
hurry up and pop it.

216
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:27,227
[SHIZUKO]
Now listen here, Sakura: I have
had just about enough of this!

217
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:31,865
He dresses all glitzy, in a
fashion that makes no sense, and
yet he has the audacity to act
so pretentious!

218
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,334
I have absolutely no
idea what you see in him!

219
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,838
The more time we spend in this
human mob the angrier I get!
[SAKURA] Shizuko...

220
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,708
[SHIZUKO, muttering]
Ah, I'm sorry, Sakura, I said
too much please forgive me.

221
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,777
[SAKURA, thinking]
Shizuko's starting to lose it!

222
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,846
I just need a moment to calm
down and I'll be just fine.

223
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:47,881
[SAKURA]
I'm really sorry. Shizuko...

224
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,917
Even if you ask me what I see
in him it's hard to explain...

225
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,319
I mean‐ Yeah, I think he's
the coolest guy I've ever met,

226
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,990
and I respect him for following
his dreams no matter what, so
there's that but...

227
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,362
[SAKURA] But... it's so much
more than that. It's something
that words can't describe.

228
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:07,067
[SAKURA]
When you love someone... you
just can't help how you feel.

229
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,403
[SAKURA]
So if someone objects, or even
if you know it's not right,

230
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:15,676
once you've felt that feeling...
you just can't stop.

231
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,714
[BOY]
You've successfully completed
the Love Trial! Congratulations!

232
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:24,117
[GIRL] That ticket can be
used for a special event at
the festival's after‐party.

233
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,620
Please, make sure to enjoy
tonight to the fullest!

234
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,954
[MISAKI'S GHOST] How nice.

235
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,591
Huh? How come Misa
isn't working today?

236
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,225
I don't know.
Don't ask me.

237
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,227
Did she have to run an
errand or something?

238
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,429
She should've asked ME
to come along, too.

239
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,232
Why would she do
something like that,
you perverted idiot?

240
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,603
Oh my. You're all looking very
relaxed today, Masters.

241
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,137
[SHIROKAWA]
We're putty in your hands.

242
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,006
[KUROSAKI]
It's like, we don't
know who's who anymore.

243
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,941
[SARASHINA]
In fact, it's almost like
we're not even human.

244
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,011
It makes me so happy to see you
relax yourselves so fully here

245
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,346
at Maid Latte. Please make
yourselves at home.

246
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,447
[ALL] Okay.

247
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,582
[HONOKA]
I'm sorry for the wait.

248
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,250
Here is your cream
soda, Masters.

249
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,384
[ALL] Wow!

250
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,654
[ALL] That's it. There it
is, there it is...!

251
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,488
[SUBARU]
Manager, I'm so sorry I'm late!

252
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,125
[ERIKA]
And I had to stay late to do an
assignment. I'm sorry, Manager.

253
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,694
[SATSUKI]
No worries! I'm just glad
the two of you are here.

254
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,395
[KUROSAKI]
Hey, how do we drink this?

255
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,164
[SARASHINA]
We have to go back to our
original forms to do that.

256
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,033
[SHIROKAWA]
How do we do that again?

257
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:13,767
[ALL] Uh...

258
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,435
(Students welcoming)

259
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,003
Well, that was a lot of fun.

260
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,304
You were having more
fun taunting me

261
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,906
than you were playing
those stupid games!

262
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,975
So you're saying you didn't
have any fun at all?

263
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:26,913
Uh, I... Well, I wouldn't say I
had "fun", but...

264
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:31,117
Shouldn't you go get your bag?

265
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,019
Oh... yeah...

266
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,841
(Concert starting,
crowd cheering)

267
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:01,815
(Sakura excited giggles)

268
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:21,001
(Happy chuckles)

269
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,971
[BOY] It's already started!

270
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,007
[MISAKI] Sounds like the
concert's finally started.

271
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,942
[USUI] It looks like they're
a lot later than planned.

272
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,544
What makes you say that, Usui?

273
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,912
[USUI] It's written right here.

274
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,147
[CROWD] Hana o!

275
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,051
[CROWD] Zutto!

276
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,454
[CROWD] Hana o!

277
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,562
[CROWD] Hana wa!

278
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:52,132
[CROWD] Zutto!

279
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:57,070
[MISAKI]
Geez, the closer we get to the
stage, the more crowded it gets.

280
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,773
That's why I said we should meet
up with them AFTER the show.

281
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:03,409
I thought it would be better
if we were close by when it
finished! GAH!

282
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,312
[MISAKI] Ah! Usui!

283
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,116
[USUI]
You okay? Afraid
you'll get lost?

284
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,120
[USUI]
If you want...
I can hold your hand.

285
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,257
[MISAKI, angrily]
Argh! That won't be necessary!

286
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,985
(Giddy chuckles)

287
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:50,123
[SHIZUKO] Sakura! You must get
a hold of yourself! Your
behavior is incomprehensible!

288
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:19,219
[MISAKI] Hello, Sakura?

289
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,421
Looks like the show's over, huh?

290
00:15:21,522 --> 00:15:23,123
What? You can't meet up?

291
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:26,993
C‐C‐Cuz Kuuga...
K‐Kuuga... Uh, um‐

292
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,262
[SHIZUKO]
Jeez, just let ME explain!

293
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,331
It seems that a certain
someone from Yumemishi

294
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,867
will be joining us to take
a walk around the festival.

295
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,169
Huh?! Someone from Yumemishi?

296
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:42,375
Yeesh. What the heck.
For a minute, I thought I was
going to get tailed again.

297
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:43,610
Uh...

298
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,746
[SHIZUKO] Mr. Kuuga called
earlier to say he wished

299
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:49,115
to walk around the festival,
and wanted us to tag along as
"camouflage."

300
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,517
Okay, I understand.

301
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,187
I'll call you guys back
a little later.

302
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,456
[KUUGA]
What? You don't glare
at me like that.

303
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:59,425
Don't worry, I'm not
interested in you.

304
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:03,630
[KUUGA]
I've had my fill of that
scary face of yours.

305
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,898
[MISAKI]
What are you after?

306
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,399
[KUUGA]
You mean Sakura?

307
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,769
Am I not allowed to walk
around the festival with her?

308
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:12,939
If you ask, she won't refuse.
Are you using her because
she's convenient?

309
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,541
As always, you're
one scary lady.

310
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,110
To be honest, I don't trust you
as far as I can throw you.

311
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:23,316
But Sakura was trying her
hardest to convince me that
you'd changed, so I came here
to see for myself.

312
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,919
I've changed, huh?

313
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,388
[MISAKI] Staaaare

314
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,190
[KUUGA]
What're you giving
me that look for?

315
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,025
[MISAKI]
Please excuse my "scary" face.

316
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,627
Since I have no idea
how you've "changed,"

317
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,296
I have to keep staring until
I see it for myself.

318
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,631
[KUUGA] You just wouldn't
understand.

319
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,733
[SAKURA]
Kuuga! I'm here to
visit you again!

320
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,403
She's the only girl who's
ever tried to really see
me for what I really am.

321
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,372
Uh? So does that mean
you're actually in l‐‐

322
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,240
[KUUGA] Stop!

323
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,075
You are WAY too overprotective.

324
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,845
Just go off and be with your
boyfriend, and leave me in
peace, will ya? GAH!

325
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,547
[MISAKI]
Boyfriend?

326
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,682
That waiter guy who
called himself a
stalker or whatever.

327
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:59,152
N‐No, you've got it wrong!
He's just a perverted weirdo
stalker‐ nothing more!

328
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:02,789
Huh, don't tell me, are you
seriously still making that
guy hold himself back?

329
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,957
What are you...?

330
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,491
Geez, not only are
you a mood‐killer,

331
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,360
but you're a violent stick in
the mud‐

332
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,462
I couldn't spend a day with you
even if someone paid me!

333
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,698
That's MY line you
stupid son of a‐!

334
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:15,569
Aah, how scary.
See ya. Medusa.

335
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,873
[MISAKI, thinking]
What did he mean... he's
"holding himself back"? Uh?

336
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:23,810
[USUI]
Sorry for the wait. It was
crowded so it took longer
than I thought.

337
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,978
What're you‐

338
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,713
Is something wrong?

339
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,550
No... It's nothing really.

340
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:35,488
[MISAKI]
Well, at the end of the day,
least I did what I set out to
do, I think.

341
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,991
[USUI]
Huh? That's a pretty
anticlimactic ending.

342
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,562
[MISAKI]
It's not like there's really
anything else I can do anyway.

343
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:45,666
[USUI]
Well, if everything's all
wrapped up here... should
we head out?

344
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:51,505
N‐No. While we're here,
I... I'd like to stay for
the after‐party. You know?

345
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,541
[MISAKI] Usui, are...
Are you okay on time?

346
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,845
Uhhh... That was an
incredibly unexpected line.

347
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,080
[MISAKI] Blgh!

348
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,815
The heck?! I was
just asking, okay!

349
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,049
Is that so bad?!

350
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,618
If you don't want to,
I'll go on my own!

351
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:05,719
[USUI] I'll go.

352
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,020
After all, we still have that

353
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,089
special ticket we won in
that love challenge.

354
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,757
[MISAKI] Oh yeah...

355
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:16,563
[MISAKI]
So THIS is what they meant when
they said "special event"?

356
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,899
[GIRL A]
And the size is just right.
It's perfect!

357
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:22,503
[GIRL B]
A special dress to make a
special memory on a special day!

358
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,370
[GIRL A]
Have as much fun as you
like with it, okay?

359
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:28,341
[GIRL B]
Now then‐ your Romeo awaits!

360
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,476
Hey.

361
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:31,912
That looks good on you, Juliet.

362
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,446
Don't call me that,
it's embarrassing,

363
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,081
[USUI] Apparently, they'll be
doing fireworks

364
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,150
at the after‐party, too.
[MISAKI] Is that so?

365
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,685
[USUI] I'd like to find
somewhere to watch them.

366
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,120
[MISAKI] Okay...

367
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,027
[USUI] Oh, perfect. We'll be
able to see the fireworks, and
no one will bother us.

368
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,294
Are we allowed in here?

369
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,596
We're not doing anything wrong,

370
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,864
so it should be fine.
[BOY A] Are you ready?

371
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,298
[BOY B] Hang on!

372
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,000
[USUI] What's wrong?

373
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,502
Uh....

374
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:56,570
Ayuzawa...

375
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,470
What's with YOU?!

376
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,939
There's nothing wrong at all.

377
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,841
Is that right? Then I'm glad.

378
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:02,509
Maybe we should
go somewhere else.

379
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,111
It would be more fun to see
the bonfire up close, right?

380
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:06,680
A‐Are you holding back?

381
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,515
About the fireworks?
I don't care too much about‐

382
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,483
That's not what I'm
talking about! Are you...

383
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:14,320
Have you been holding
yourself back all this
time because of me?

384
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,457
Why do you think that?

385
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,026
[MISAKI]
N‐no reason, I just, sort of,

386
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,628
thought maybe that was the case.

387
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,296
[USUI]
Huh. How perceptive of you.

388
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,998
So you HAVE been holding
back? What have‐?

389
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:26,466
[USUI] How cruel, Ayuzawa.

390
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:29,235
Are you... trying to
make me say it?

391
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:35,241
[USUI]
Then, if you answer my question,
I'll answers yours, too.

392
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,409
[MISAKI] What...?

393
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,712
[USUI]
What makes you care about me?

394
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:44,685
What kind of question is
that... I guess my answer
is, I don't know.

395
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:47,220
You don't know... huh?

396
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:49,856
Then, did you know...

397
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,458
that at times like this, it's
impossible for you to lie?

398
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,460
[MISAKI] Wh‐What are you
talking about?

399
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:56,963
Ayuzawa, why is your
face turning so red?

400
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,231
It's not red at all‐

401
00:19:58,331 --> 00:19:59,465
[USUI] Are you nervous?

402
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,468
[MISAKI] N‐no, I'm not!

403
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,506
[USUI] Ayuzawa, aren't YOU the
one who's holding back?

404
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,578
[USUI]
I'm sorry. I went too far.

405
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,047
[MISAKI]
I am holding back...

406
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:15,315
[USUI] Uh?!

407
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,083
[MISAKI]
I've BEEN holding back.

408
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,720
Why did it turn out this way?!
Why did it have to be you...?

409
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,323
I don't get it at all! You're
a pervert, and all you do is
piss me off...

410
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,959
[MISAKI] You're still running
ahead of me, making it look so
easy.
[USUI] Ayuzawa?

411
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,328
You make fun of me all the time!
[USUI] Calm down! What are
you...?

412
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,665
[MISAKI] This is your fault. If
we hadn't done that stupid game,
I wouldn't have realized.

413
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,167
The truth is‐ I've always
wanted to hold your hand!

414
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,738
Just when I think I've got
you figured out, it's like
you lose me again.

415
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:40,140
What are you thinking?
I just don't get it...

416
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,877
I don't understand why my heart
won't stop racing when I'm
around you?

417
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,580
Or why do I have to get
so lonely when we're apart?

418
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,953
I‐ Why are you... the only one
who can make me feel like this?

419
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:55,856
[MISAKI] Stupid Usui.

420
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:58,559
Why do you always have
to pick a fight with me?

421
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,396
[USUI] You really...
are cruel, Ayuzawa.

422
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:07,433
How much longer do you
plan to make me hold back?

423
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:11,505
I pick fights with you because
I want to see your reactions.

424
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,174
Normally, you're the
hardheaded student council
president,

425
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,610
but suddenly you'll look
cute, or surprised,

426
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,479
or you'll be completely
worked up over nothing.

427
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,815
[USUI] You asked me if
I've been holding back?

428
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,786
I've held back so many times
that I can't give an answer.
[MISAKI] Huh?

429
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,022
[USUI] Just like right now.

430
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,651
[USUI]
Do you want to know what
I'm thinking, right this
very second, Misa?

431
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,456
I love you, Ayuzawa.

432
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,664
[MISAKI] I really...
I really hate you.

433
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:15,335
[USUI] True to form...
You're too cruel, Ayuzawa.

434
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,004
[MISAKI] Stupid Usui...

435
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,824
[MISAKI] Ah! I forgot I need
an apron for today's lesson!
I'm so screwed!

436
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:13,059
Don't worry, Sis,
I've got you covered.

437
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:15,796
We happen to have an
apron I won in the sweepstakes.

438
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,931
I'm sure wearing this
would make them happy.

439
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:18,999
Make WHO happy?!

440
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:22,035
Oh, who indeed...
(laughing)

441
00:23:24,037 --> 00:23:27,941
Aah, it's so nice to enjoy
some peace and quiet
before the shop opens...

442
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,810
[AOI] Satsuki! I got
kicked out again!

443
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,945
[AOI] I'll be counting
on you, okay?
[SATSUKI] Oh, okay...

444
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:34,581
[SHINTANI] I know now, I gotta
make myself into a better man!

445
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,783
After all, I'm going
up against that guy!

446
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,852
[USUI] It's not "That guy."
The name's Usui.

447
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,353
[SHINTANI]
And I'm definitely
gonna beat him!

448
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,755
[SHINTANI] G'morning, Misaki!

449
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,323
Why are you coming to school
eating bread crusts?!

450
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,025
[USUI] Misa, I love you.
[SAKURA] Oh! Misaki!

451
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:46,660
[SHIZUKO] Misaki.
[YUKIMURA] Miss President!
[KANOU] Impossible.

452
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,694
[TORA] Interesting, huh, Maki?
[MAKI] It is.

453
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,195
[TRIO] Misa's the best!
