1
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,397
[MISAKI]
How many times do I have to
tell you guys?!

2
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,266
Shirokawa! Your hair should be
black! And no earrings allowed!

3
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,002
Sarashina!
Shirts should be buttoned

4
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,737
and belts fastened at the waist!

5
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,707
(Boys annoyed)
[MISAKI]
Kurosaki! Wear the proper shoes!

6
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,341
THIS is how it should be done!

7
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,610
Hmph!

8
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,580
Eh?
Huh?

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,816
[MISAKI]
Don't come back
till you're decent!

10
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,193
(Boys horsing around)

11
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,363
I swear...

12
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,633
I feel like I'm surrounded by
nothing but lowlives

13
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,900
day in and day out.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,703
Hey, Yukimura! Have you gotten
that proposal together?

15
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,006
[YUKIMURA]
Uh, Miss President, are you
sure this is really necssary?

16
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,208
A "Guidebook of
Student Conduct"?

17
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,210
[MISAKI]
(Groan)
You fool!

18
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,779
Of course it is!

19
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,281
Otherwise you idiotic males
would just end up slacking off!

20
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,083
[YUKIMURA]
Y‐yes, ma'am!

21
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:33,720
[MISAKI]
It's been several years since
Seika High School became co‐ed.

22
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,525
However, this former all‐boys'
school still retains an
80% male population.

23
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,062
I was elected the first female
student council president.

24
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,764
And since becoming president,

25
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,734
I've ruled al of these
buffoons with an iron fist!

26
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,370
This place has made my
skin crawl since day one!

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,238
Stinky! Dirty! Slovenly!

28
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,408
Powerless, the female students
could do nothing but
endure the male students'

29
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,278
blatant disregard
for common decency.

30
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,182
But something had to give,
so I worked hard...

31
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,417
harder than I've ever
worked before!

32
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,954
My dedication combined with
the power of basic manners,

33
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,790
helped me earn
the teachers' trust,

34
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,491
and successfully gain
the position of
student council president.

35
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,663
[SARASHINA]
C'mon, he's askin' you nicely!

36
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,299
Just take care of
the cleaning for us!

37
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,368
B‐but I can't...
I have things to do...

38
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,070
[KUROSAKI]
It's just one day!

39
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,972
[MISAKI]
Do your own cleaning!
[BOYS] Huh?!

40
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,641
If you've got
a problem with that

41
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,043
then maybe you'd prefer cleaning
the toilets for a week instead!

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,111
[GIRL]
President!

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,746
I'll take it from here.

44
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:33,814
Yes, ma'am!

45
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,582
What's your problem now,
Madame President?

46
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,251
That should be my line,
you three idiots!

47
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,686
What did you just say to me?!

48
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,622
Idiots who can't even
stay in dresscode

49
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,323
aren't worthy of being
called by name.

50
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,391
For the last time,
take those earrings out now!

51
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,860
This is my final warning!

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,129
Yeah, yeah. I'll be sure
to take them out later.

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,764
I said "NOW"
and I mean it!

54
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:55,068
Geez, shut up!
I SAID I'd do it LATER!

55
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,237
And I said NOW!

56
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,238
Ow!

57
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,873
Ah! She's a monster!

58
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,875
[MISAKI] These are mine!
[KUROSAKI]
She ripped'em right out!

59
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,210
(Running away crying)

60
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,179
Wait, damnit! Your cleaning!

61
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,581
[BOYS]
We will remember this!

62
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,148
(Girl crying)

63
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,883
Oh, now what?

64
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,653
[MISAKI]
Hey, what's going on here?

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,689
Nothing really.

66
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,824
I just turned down
her love confession.

67
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,893
You again, Takumi Usui?!

68
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,295
[THINKING]
This guy breaks hearts
left and right!

69
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,897
(Girl crying)

70
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,567
I've told you, you need to work
on your rejection technique!

71
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,069
Next time you make a girl cry
I'm coming for you!

72
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,638
(Grunt)

73
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,141
[USUI]
How many times
have I heard that one?

74
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,743
I wonder what's up
with the president

75
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,045
hating on the guy
students all the time?

76
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,816
Usui, you've gotta find a way
to make her cry "Uncle."

77
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,819
Do it yourself.
I couldn't care less.

78
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,287
Uncle!

79
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,757
[MISAKI]
Men who make women cry...

80
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,959
I hate them!

81
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,801
Huh?!

82
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,404
Both sides breaking at once?

83
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,641
Oh great! Not another
repair bill...!

84
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,678
I'm home!

85
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,484
(Crash)
Ah!

86
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,787
[SUZUNA]
Oh, Misaki.
You're home.

87
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:23,156
Suzuna! What's with this
death pit here?!

88
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,258
It's where I stepped earlier.

89
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,928
I think the wood is
rotten in that spot.

90
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,496
Yeah but did you really have to
cover it up with a newspaper

91
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:31,765
like some kind of hidden trap?

92
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:34,067
(Evil laugh)
Cunning, wasn't it?

93
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,537
There's nothing
"cunning" about it!

94
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,473
Suzuna, you didn't
hurt yourself, did you?

95
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,876
Suzuna?

96
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,383
I guess that means she's fine...

97
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,421
(Cough)

98
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,990
[MISAKI]
Hey, Mom!

99
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:57,858
Oh, Misaki.

100
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,825
I'm home.

101
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,226
Welcome back.

102
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,328
You worked the late shift at
the hospital last night, right?

103
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,199
Your body's not that strong.
Don't push yourself too hard.

104
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,501
I'll be fine.

105
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,103
I can't rely on you for
everything, Misaki.

106
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,272
I can take care of
myself just fine.

107
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:17,110
[SUZUNA]
We relied on Dad,
and he ran off and left us
with a mountain of debt.

108
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,979
There's no need to
bring that up!

109
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,049
Oh, your boss from Maid Latte
left a message for you
a while ago.

110
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,587
She said someone can't
make it so she'd like
you to come instead.

111
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,389
Huh? Really?!
Then I've gotta go
right now!

112
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,791
Why didn't you say so?!

113
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,159
Whoa, that was close!
I almost fell in again!

114
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,297
Misaki, do you think you
could mail this postcard
for me while you're out?

115
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,464
Another sweepstakes?

116
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,567
You got it.

117
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,669
Make sure you rest, Mom.
I'll be back!

118
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,973
(Crash)
Whoa! There's THIS, too?
(Crying)

119
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,408
Even though we're poor

120
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,578
we really need to find a way
to get her a cellphone.

121
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,548
(Doorbell)

122
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,951
Welcome back to
Maid Latte, Master!

123
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,887
Right this way, please!

124
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,624
Hey, Misa!
Yeah?

125
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:06,192
I apologize for calling you in
on such short notice.

126
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,663
No problem! It looks like
there'll be a lot of
expenses this month,

127
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,197
so it actually worked out.

128
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,666
Oh, Miss Misa!

129
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,000
Yessir?

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,469
Can I get one Cutesy‐Cutesy
Rice Omelette, please?

131
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,842
(Giggle)
One Cutesy‐Cutesy Rice Omelette
coming right up for you, Master!

132
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,849
(Groan)
I wish I could just quit
this place already!

133
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,085
But this is the only place
that works with my busy
school schedule,

134
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,155
not to mention they pay
more than anywhere else.

135
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,825
But if anyone from school saw me
like this I'd be finished...

136
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:39,693
Well then.

137
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,994
Ah!

138
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:46,800
THIS is surprise...
Miss President.

139
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,205
Takumi Usui?!

140
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,144
It's all over.
I'm doomed.

141
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,481
This is going to spread through
the school like wildfire.

142
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,950
There's no way I'll be able to
maintain my image

143
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,821
when people find out their
student council president
is a part‐time maid!

144
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:11,558
All the effort I put in
will be... will be...!

145
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,860
Time for a little break!

146
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,461
Ah!

147
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:16,863
Manager! Manager!

148
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,566
There's some unknown
lifeform in the breakroom!

149
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,068
Huh? What's going on in here?

150
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,404
Misa, are you all right?!

151
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,207
[SATSUKI] If you're not feeling
well you can just go on home.
[HONOKA] It was Misa
the whole time?

152
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,310
No, I'll be fine.

153
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,978
[MISAKI]
Good night, everyone.

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,247
Hm?

155
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,082
Oh, you're back to normal.

156
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,685
Wh‐what're you doing here?!
What do want?

157
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:42,255
Oh, nothing really. I just
wanted to find out for myself

158
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,126
that our student council
president really works
as a maid.

159
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,394
So, why are you doing this
kind of job anyway?

160
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,596
Uh!

161
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,232
[HONOKA]
Manager, I'll be going now!

162
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,834
[SATSUKI]
Good work today!

163
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,735
Ah!

164
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:55,802
Let's go somewhere else.

165
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,038
What the‐?
Just come on!

166
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,210
I see. So it's because
of things at home?

167
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,946
Are they that bad?

168
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,047
I guess.

169
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,016
So, that's why you got
a job at a maid cafÃ©?

170
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:12,553
Couldn't you have gotten a
manual labor job or something?

171
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,655
I tried that already.

172
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:18,391
But I couldn't allow my
performance as student
council president to suffer.

173
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,161
In the end I couldn't
keep up with both.

174
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,698
Wow. Sounds pretty rough.

175
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,303
Oh. So even though you hate guys
you chose Seika high school,

176
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,138
because of the cheap tuition?

177
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,740
I guess.

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,977
[THINKING]
I have no idea what's going on
in this guy's head.

179
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,479
(Sigh)

180
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,848
[USUI]
My condolences.

181
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:50,991
I can't let this destroy the
carefully crafted respect that
I've built with my peers.

182
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,330
(Irritated)

183
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,766
Not something like this.

184
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,471
(Sigh)

185
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,174
Why can't I catch a break?

186
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,216
[MISAKI]
Three days passed...

187
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19,686
[BOY]
So, for a maid‐

188
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,787
Uh, a maid?!

189
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,422
U‐uh, for a "maid souvenir"

190
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:25,358
my grandpa said he wants
a picture with a
high school girl...

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,061
Geez, he was just talking
about a stupid souvenir.

192
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,363
Oh yeah, by the way,
the other day, this made‐

193
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,497
"Maid"?!

194
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,634
U‐uh, that
MADE‐in‐Tochigi t‐shirt

195
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,902
I really liked
didn't fit me anymore.

196
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,739
Oh! "MADE"‐in‐Tochigi, huh?

197
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,274
Huh? What the‐?!

198
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,776
This is bad.

199
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,746
Every time I hear the word
"maid" I overreact like crazy.

200
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,415
Still, it's strange that no one
else knows about it yet.

201
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,387
(Evil little demon laugh)
Does he plan to use it
against me?

202
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,890
Or maybe he feels sorry for me?

203
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,526
He's annoying,
but that'd make things easier.

204
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,261
[SAKURA]
Misaki!

205
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,029
Sakura. Shizuko.

206
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,931
You tired
or something?

207
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,933
Sorry, I was just
thinking about something.

208
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,737
Misaki, you really have to
stop worrying so much
about everything.

209
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,674
We've got a really big
favor to ask!

210
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,241
Hm?

211
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,111
[MISAKI]
This is...

212
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:21,882
A sandbag.
From the boxing club?

213
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,284
[SHIZUKO]
It seems rather
intimidating...

214
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,253
It's blocking our path,
and we're unable to get to
the Flower Arranging Club.

215
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,322
[MISAKI]
I'll have a word with
the boxing club.

216
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,092
At any rate, it still
needs to be moved.
Stand back a little.

217
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,361
[SAKURA]
But it's really stinky
and really heavy.

218
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,198
Just leave it...to me!

219
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,569
We are the Boxing Club!
What's going on?

220
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,571
Put this up
before I take you out!

221
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,039
Yes ma'am!

222
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,742
Wow, Misaki!
You're incredible!

223
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,276
[MISAKI]
It was no big deal.

224
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,945
It was much lighter
than I thought it'd be.

225
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,581
Thank you! I love you!

226
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,017
Please accept this
token of thanks.

227
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,457
(Giggle)

228
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,762
Thanks you two.

229
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:14,500
Oh! Isn't that Usui over there?

230
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:15,569
Uh!

231
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,103
What are you looking at?!

232
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,304
Hmph.

233
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,306
[SAKURA]
"Hmph"? What's that
supposed to mean?

234
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,942
I have no idea.

235
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,144
But Usui sure is
handsome, isn't he?

236
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,178
Huh?

237
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,347
I heard that he practiced
Shorinji Kempo

238
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,016
all through junior high
so not only is he super manly
but he's super tough, too!

239
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:33,453
All the male students idolize
him and the female students
practically fall at his feet!

240
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,722
Plus, he's at the top of his
class in every subject!

241
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,923
And don't forget about
his looks!

242
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,258
He's a knight in
shining armor

243
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,393
in a school full of
brainless neanderthals!

244
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:44,598
But he's SO popular that
now he isn't interested
in girls at all. Boo!

245
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,802
Even so that doesn't
keep them from continuing
to confess to him, does it?

246
00:12:48,902 --> 00:12:50,871
I had no idea
he was so popular.

247
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,607
I don't get what they
see in him.
[SHIZUKO]
Love truly defies reason.

248
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,075
I see!

249
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,044
Maybe he doesn't care
that I'm a maid

250
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,981
because he's just
not interested!

251
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,652
Uh...

252
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:08,488
What the hell did you
come back here for?!

253
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,970
[MISAKI]
What's going on?
What does he want?!

254
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,371
Woah, who's that?

255
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,573
He's hot!

256
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,976
Ah. Found you.

257
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,746
Is he making fun of me?
Is this some kind of test?

258
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,249
Or a challenge? Yeah, it's
a challenge, isn't it?

259
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:40,654
Fine, you son of a bitch!
Get ready!

260
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:43,223
Welcome back to
Maid Latte, Master!

261
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,466
(pfft)

262
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,036
[MISAKI]
I'm gonna kill him!

263
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,539
I'm sorry for the wait.

264
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:05,011
Staaaaaare...

265
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,781
Hey, hey Misaki is that guy
your boyfriend?

266
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,883
It's like he can't keep
his eyes off you!

267
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,184
No, he's not.

268
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,385
Wha‐?

269
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,023
This guy's backing me
into a psychological corner

270
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,226
and he's loving
every second of it!

271
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,094
(Evil laugh)

272
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,495
He had one cup of coffee

273
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:27,200
and sat there for a
friggin' hour, STARING at me.

274
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,605
(Sigh)
What an exausting experience.
I feel drained.

275
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,874
(Students chatter)

276
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,743
Huh? Usui, you're still here?

277
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,312
Yeah.

278
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,848
Hey Takezawa,
you and the president

279
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,750
went to the same
junior high, right?

280
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,085
Oh, yeah.

281
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,120
Has she always had that
intensity about her?

282
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,423
Nah, she was totally like
a different person.

283
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:53,326
I think it was around our second
year that she really changed.

284
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:56,296
Apparently she had
some kinda trouble at home.

285
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,465
She hasn't been
the same since.

286
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,768
Hold up, why are you suddenly
asking about a girl...

287
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,670
and the president at that?

288
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,512
[MISAKI]
He's here AGAIN.

289
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,714
[MISAKI]
Doesn't he realize how much
attention he's attracting?

290
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:15,582
[GON‐CHAN]That guy's here AGAIN!
[SAYU] Looks like he's
got his eye on Misa.

291
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,519
I just knew there was something
going on between you two!

292
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:21,588
I mean just look at
those puppy‐dog eyes!

293
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,624
Uh... his what now?

294
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,392
Wha‐?!

295
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,767
That's what his stupid face
normally looks like.

296
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,603
There's no "puppy‐dog" anything.

297
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,271
Hey, Misaki!

298
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,575
Good job! You got second place
in the school‐wide
practice exams.

299
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,076
Second?

300
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,311
Wait a sec...
then who came in first?

301
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,847
Mr. Takumi Usui.

302
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,982
No frickin' way!

303
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,556
Huh?

304
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,058
It seems she took
the news rather hard.

305
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:02,729
I'm working my butt off and
he's just laughing it up
and enjoying the show.

306
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:06,199
He's obviously
looking down on me.

307
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,605
Is that pornographic material
you've got over there?

308
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:13,173
N‐no it's just a magazine.

309
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,942
It's got some bikini pinups but
they're tasteful, we swear!

310
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,377
Confiscated!

311
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,046
That's not fair! Girls get
to do whatever they want,

312
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,382
but the guys get punished
for everything!

313
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,819
That's like some kinda
inequality of the sexes
or something!

314
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,353
Yeah if you're gonna be
tough on the guys

315
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,923
you have to be tough
on the girls, too!

316
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:31,424
You're right.

317
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:34,027
I will make sure to investigate
this matter immediately.

318
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,729
Innapropriate content is banned,

319
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,430
no matter who is
in possession of it.

320
00:16:37,531 --> 00:16:40,000
In the meantime please let me
know what you would
like to read.

321
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,668
Both boys and girls.

322
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,203
Huh?

323
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:44,971
But that means you'll have to
look through all of it.

324
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,340
You're way too busy to do
all of that by yourself!

325
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,678
It's fine. After all it's
my duty as student council
president.

326
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:00,854
P‐President...?

327
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:01,822
Huh?

328
00:17:01,922 --> 00:17:03,456
Uh...l‐last month's...

329
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:06,960
b‐balance sheet didn't quite
add up s‐so it's a little off...

330
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,795
and I thought maybe you
could take a look...

331
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,030
AH!

332
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,565
You messed up the budget AGAIN?!

333
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,333
Damnit, Sawa, you're useless!
[SAWA] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

334
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,969
Just forget it,
I'll do it myself.

335
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,704
(Coughing)

336
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,774
(Cough)

337
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,677
(Sigh)
I sure am busy...

338
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,046
(Cough)

339
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,148
What are you,
some kinda masochist?

340
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,216
(Gasp)
What are you doing here?!

341
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,519
You seem to really enjoy
punishing yourself.

342
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,221
Oh, but I guess
that'd be sadism.
Huh?!

343
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,659
You really oughtta give yourself
a break every once and awhile.

344
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,294
Seeing you like this is...

345
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,496
Oh, no...

346
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,700
That was a close one, huh?

347
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,101
(Gasp)

348
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,070
Get away!

349
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,440
I don't need any help...
especially not from YOU!

350
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,544
Yeah. Right.

351
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,519
(Cough)

352
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,860
(Cough)

353
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,798
I don't have time
to take a break!

354
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,432
(Sighing)

355
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,735
I have to go back and
fix the budget,

356
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,571
and then look through
all those magazines, too...

357
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:29,209
Plus I have to make sure I have
time to study on top of that.

358
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,444
I just think you have to
take a break sometime

359
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,614
so you don't get burnt out.

360
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:39,485
I don't need any help...
especially not from YOU!

361
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,756
I'm never one to half‐ass
any of my duties...

362
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:45,325
I feel like crap.

363
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:47,628
No way!
Is that the president?

364
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:48,995
Oh, it is.

365
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,531
Seriously? A MAID?

366
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,199
Oh, this is rich!
We gotta call everyone up!

367
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,602
Y'know, my ears really hurt.

368
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,103
I gotta get a pic!

369
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,239
[MISAKI]
This is the worst.

370
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,207
Tryin' to run away?

371
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,609
I don't think so,
Miss President.

372
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,845
You harass guys left
and right at school,

373
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:06,613
but you're
actually a maid?

374
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:07,814
Let go!

375
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:11,117
Oh no you're gonna stay
and serve us personally.

376
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,686
Alright, say cheese!

377
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,688
Say "Master"
or something.

378
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:16,623
[KUROSAKI]
Yeah, that's what you're
supposed to say, right?

379
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,759
[MISAKI]
I don't... have any strength...

380
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:22,295
So even the president can
look girly when she wants.

381
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,566
Dressing like this
makes you even cuter‐

382
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,602
That doesn't give you
permission to touch her.

383
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,438
Oh man, you're burning up.
[BOYS] Usui!

384
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:33,907
(Cough)

385
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,241
Ah!

386
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:40,480
Uh... I'm sorry...

387
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,385
(Labored beathing)

388
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,224
I'm sorry, Usui.

389
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,964
It's all right.
Just get some rest.

390
00:20:07,841 --> 00:20:08,742
[MINAKO]
Misaki?

391
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,176
I was so worried.

392
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,746
Your boss called and
told me you'd collapsed.

393
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:14,014
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:14,114 --> 00:20:15,248
It's okay.

395
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,918
Just go on back to bed
and relax.

396
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,432
[MISAKI]
If I can rest for just a day,

397
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,768
I'm sure my head will
clear right up.

398
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:41,474
[USUI]
Don't worry, those guys
aren't going to out you.

399
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:43,844
Really?

400
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,212
I find that hard to believe.

401
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:48,014
Did you do something to them?

402
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,683
Not really.

403
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:52,052
I just told them I was
enjoying our little secret...

404
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:54,454
And that I'd appreciate it
if they didn't say anything.

405
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,623
So you have been
enjoying yourself.

406
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,260
If I told you I was worried
you'd just get mad, right?

407
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,163
Well, it's not like
it'd be a big deal

408
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:05,331
if the school
found out anyway.

409
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,236
After all, it's not like
being a maid is against
the law or anything.

410
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:14,074
And wearing a maid outfit
doesn't change the fact
that you're strong,

411
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:16,577
or smart, or
incredibly hardworking.

412
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,345
I think you should be proud.

413
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,117
You know, yesterday...

414
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,788
I couldn't stop thinking
about what an infuriating
person you are.

415
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,823
But what I said now
was pretty good, right?

416
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:32,325
I feel like I'm in a race
running as fast and
hard as I can,

417
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,929
but no matter how far I go
you're always right there
in front of me,

418
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,430
running with
no trouble at all.

419
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,266
Sometimes you even run backwards
and call out to me,

420
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:41,835
like you're taunting me.
[USUI] You okay? Come on!

421
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:43,970
I hate losing, so that
really pisses me off.

422
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:48,208
But this time, the fact that
you were running ahead
really saved me.

423
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,744
But watch out!
Because I'm catching up to you,

424
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,813
and soon enough I will
leave you in the dust.

425
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:55,348
Then I'm gonna be the one
running ahead

426
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,919
and worrying about you,
Usui Takumi, mark my words.

427
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,422
Oh that's right.

428
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:05,291
Thanks for the scarf,
and for everything else, too.

429
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,160
I don't want to feel
like I owe you,

430
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,130
so I wanted to thank you somehow
but I couldn't come up
with anything.

431
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,798
So just tell me what you want.

432
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:12,498
Well...

433
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,034
Uh! Whatever you want.

434
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:17,838
For just one day, I want you
to be my personal maid.

435
00:22:17,938 --> 00:22:19,773
Ah!

436
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,998
[MISAKI]
Usui! What are you thinking,
you idiot?!

437
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,034
[USUI]
Where's the harm? Stingy.

438
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:57,137
Shut up, pervert!
Wait, I thought you
didn't like girls!

439
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,605
Aah, such fun.

440
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,373
I shouldn't have made
friends with this fool.

441
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:03,944
As president, I'm
super busy preparing for
the school festival.

442
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,445
Huh? President?

443
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:08,281
I have to get more
girl students, or else
I'll fail as president!

444
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,683
What's with
all the cat ears?

445
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,552
First, there's the
theme of the festival.

446
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:13,887
How about, the "Men of
Seika High School"!

447
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:14,921
Yes, it's decided!

448
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,723
I'll show you I can
change this school!

449
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,860
Very well,
Miss President.
