1
00:01:36,366 --> 00:01:38,366
[SUDO]
This is bad. We're screwed!

2
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:39,733
(Crash)

3
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,766
[GONDA]
Let me out!

4
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,500
What're we gonna do?!

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,233
Ah! Usui, help us!

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,133
She's crazy!

7
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,900
The president told him
to repent or something

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,866
and threw him in there!

9
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:50,833
The president did?

10
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:52,333
[IWAKURA]
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,666
(Boys laughing)

12
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:57,566
Looky! Looky! Looky!

13
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,533
You guys!

14
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,633
What the hell are you
doing dancing around
in your underwear?!

15
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,266
It's fun, right?

16
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,133
(Girls screaming)

17
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,066
GOOONNDAAAAA!

18
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,200
Stay in there and repent!

19
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,766
He's been in there
ever since!

20
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,566
Then he's gonna
have to repent.

21
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:23,066
Don't say that, Usui!
Please help us save him!

22
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,700
[USUI]
I'll pass.

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,433
So much for that.
We're screwed.
Now what?

24
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:31,228
Looks like our only option
is to steal the key from her!

25
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:32,261
That's impossible!

26
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,895
Not if we take her head‐on.

27
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:36,361
But if we use a surprise
attack, we have a chance!

28
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,406
If we used everyone,
do you think it would work?

29
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,539
Yeah.

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,273
[USUI]
Move.

31
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,406
Come with me.

32
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,839
So cool!
So strong and cool!

33
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,406
Make sure you fix
that door, too.

34
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,339
Woohoo!
Free at last!

35
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:02,573
[MISAKI]
The theme for...

36
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,139
this year's school festival...

37
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,906
is THIS!

38
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,739
New students and Seika High!

39
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,773
The school festival is our
best opportunity to improve
our school's image!

40
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,739
[YUKIMURA]
I don't know
about that poster...

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,206
[MISAKI]
That's why "New Students
and Seika High" is the
only logical choice!

42
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:18,773
Right now Seika High School
is perceived as rude, crude,
and socially unacceptable,

43
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,173
but with this theme
our image will be reborn!

44
00:03:21,273 --> 00:03:24,173
By next spring we will get as
many female freshmen as possible

45
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:27,306
and cleanse this school
of its male stench!

46
00:03:29,273 --> 00:03:30,539
But Miss President...

47
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,839
Our school doesn't
look like this at all.

48
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,906
Isn't it a little
too misleading?

49
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:38,273
(Slam)
(scared foley)

50
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:39,939
That's the whole point!

51
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,573
It's going to be up to YOU to
make this fantasy into reality!

52
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:46,906
The rebirth of this school's
image is going to depend on
us working together!

53
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:53,006
So did you finally manage to
come up with a proper proposal?

54
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:56,373
We'll sacrifice the...
Bellybutton Dance...

55
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,806
[MISAKI]
Some sacrifice!

56
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,506
So even though our last idea
was cool and amazing,

57
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:02,473
we might've gone
a little overboard.

58
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:04,606
So, we toned it down...

59
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:07,006
And we came up with THIS!

60
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:10,706
"Strip rock‐paper‐scissors
tournament."

61
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,239
Rejected!

62
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,639
But why?! This is a Seika
School Festival tradition!

63
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:16,073
There's no such tradition.

64
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,406
Yeah‐huh! We did it last year
and it was a big hit!

65
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:19,839
Maybe with the boys it was.

66
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:21,273
What's wrong with that?!

67
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,906
We're supposed to enjoy
the school festival, too!

68
00:04:23,006 --> 00:04:25,606
The theme of this year's
festival is going to be...

69
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,839
"New Students and
Seika High School!"

70
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,939
So pick a freakin' idea that
will ATTRACT female students,

71
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,373
and NOT send them running!

72
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,706
So, you mean like,
a poolside bikini‐photoshoot?

73
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:34,939
Rejected.

74
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,506
How about a guy on girl
wrestling match?

75
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:37,906
Rejected.

76
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,573
A sumo tournament with
girls in skimpy loincloths?

77
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:42,873
Have you morons been
listening to single word
I've been saying?!

78
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,939
Get out and don't come back
til you have a REAL idea!

79
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,673
But you keep rejecting
all the good ones!

80
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:48,639
Why can't you just
pick one of them?

81
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:51,906
Because every single thing
you've suggested has been
totally worthless!

82
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,406
I think I might faint...

83
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:55,306
[SUDO]
Usui!

84
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:56,706
Huh?

85
00:04:56,806 --> 00:04:58,606
[GONDA]
Usui! You've gotta
do something!

86
00:04:58,706 --> 00:04:59,873
[BOYS]
Usui! Usui!

87
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:05,206
Usui! Usui! Usui!

88
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,373
Okay, what am I
supposed to say, then?

89
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,073
[IWAKURA]
Say, "Let us do the strip
rock‐paper‐scissors tournament!"

90
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,906
Let us do the strip
rock‐paper‐scissors tournament.

91
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:15,939
Uh?!

92
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,273
Usui...

93
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:19,773
No, no, Usui, you need to
say it with conviction!

94
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:22,339
Yeah but I don't really care
one way or the other.

95
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,473
[BOYS]
What?!

96
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,306
But they've got a point...

97
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,506
don't you think you should
take the guys' opinions
into consideration, too?

98
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:29,839
(Grunt)

99
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,206
[MISAKI THINKING]
I can't argue with him.

100
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:38,073
W‐welcome back, M‐Master.

101
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:39,639
Cat ears today?

102
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,939
[MISAKI THINKING]
I hate this guy!

103
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,739
Just because you have me
at a disadvantage

104
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,106
doesn't mean you'll
take me down without a fight!

105
00:05:44,206 --> 00:05:45,773
[USUI]
Oh Misa, I'd like to
order please.

106
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:48,006
I told you not to
come here after school!

107
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,173
If anyone else
saw me like this,

108
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:53,439
my image as student council
president would go up in smoke!

109
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:54,773
Don't worry about it.

110
00:05:54,873 --> 00:05:56,573
After all, THEY'RE hooked.

111
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:57,506
Huh?

112
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:59,039
Cat ears...

113
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,206
President Misaki, our precious
Misa of Maid Latte Cafe...

114
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:05,139
They're just like night
and day, aren't they?

115
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,639
[USUI]
Hard to believe they
used to be like THIS.

116
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:09,606
Now they're
your biggest fans.

117
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:11,939
I'm grateful to you
for keeping my secret,

118
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,773
but the school festival
is completely different.

119
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,573
The only reason
I haven't said anything

120
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:20,973
is because I don't want
anyone else getting in on
my secret enjoyment.

121
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:27,306
[SATSUKI]
Misa, would you mind
dropping this off?

122
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,839
Sorry for the wait, Masters!

123
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,339
Here's your Cutesy‐Cutesy
Rice Omelette.

124
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:33,373
What would you like me
to write for you today?

125
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,506
U‐um, then what about how
you feel right now, Misa?

126
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,039
Your wish is my command, Master.

127
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:43,173
Misa...

128
00:06:43,273 --> 00:06:44,673
She's so cold‐hearted!

129
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,806
I know it's great!

130
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,939
I'm home.

131
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,439
[SUZUNA]
Welcome back.

132
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,906
What's this?

133
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:58,006
I won a prize from the
sweepstakes that I entered.

134
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:01,506
Wow! What is it, Suzuna?
What'd you win?

135
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:02,673
Rice.

136
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:03,773
Miso paste.

137
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,373
And soy sauce.

138
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,339
Uh... Suzuna...?

139
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,006
I know we're poor and all, but
you're a junior high student,

140
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:13,273
so why don't you try to aim a
little bit higher than that?

141
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:17,139
Don't worry it's not like I'm
doing this because we're
dirt poor, or anything.

142
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,739
I only send these off as
part of my club activities.

143
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,306
Oh, I see...

144
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:23,073
When you think about it, you're
the one who has it the worst

145
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:25,339
since you have to work
at that maid cafÃ©.

146
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,573
You must hate it, huh?

147
00:07:26,673 --> 00:07:29,073
Well, "hate" is kind of
a strong word...

148
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:30,206
So you DO like it?

149
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:31,773
Uh...

150
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:33,606
I guess when you put it that way

151
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,306
I can't say I like it either.

152
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:38,406
But the pay is so amazing that
it almost makes up for the fact

153
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,006
that I have to dress
like that...

154
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,306
Not to mention the fact that
my manager treats me well,

155
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,973
and that the customers...
They're all pretty nice, too.

156
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:47,473
So I guess...
I'm really lucky!

157
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:48,973
Boring.

158
00:07:49,073 --> 00:07:49,973
Wait what?

159
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:52,406
Why did you ask
in the first place?!

160
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,473
Of course it's rejected!

161
00:07:55,573 --> 00:07:56,873
How come?!

162
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,406
Did you really think
"Heart‐Throbbin' Cosplay

163
00:07:58,506 --> 00:08:01,739
& Strip Rock‐Paper‐Scissors
Tournament" was gonna fly?!

164
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,739
Fools even asked the girls
for their opinions?!

165
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,639
What would you guys
like to do?

166
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,239
Uh... like a coffee shop?

167
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:10,306
Perfect. Class 2‐2 will be
doing a coffee shop.

168
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,306
That's not fair!

169
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,106
You're kidding me!

170
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,139
You tyrant!

171
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,306
This is exactly why
I told you morons

172
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,106
to come up with a proper idea!

173
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,406
(Whining)

174
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:24,773
Is it okay for you to just
choose for them like that?

175
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:26,139
It had to be done.

176
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,706
If we hadn't come up
with something Class 2‐2

177
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,606
wouldn't have been
able to participate.

178
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:32,739
We just want to make sure
that everyone has a good
time at the festival,

179
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,939
that's what's
important, y'know?

180
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,106
Don't worry. The festival
will be lots of fun, I promise.

181
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:52,273
Hey, do you think you can come
help me with this box, please?!

182
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:57,239
What the hell is
this supposed to be?

183
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:59,439
It's a planetarium where
couples can hold hands

184
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,906
and get lovey‐dovey in the dark‐

185
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,673
it's a really great idea, right?

186
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:04,206
NO WAY!

187
00:09:04,306 --> 00:09:06,406
This is the opposite
of what we're going for!

188
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,806
We want to welcome girls,
not send them screaming!

189
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,173
[MISAKI]
Where are all the boys?

190
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:17,373
Oh, Misaki!

191
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,873
How 'bout you show me
what you've got... 'kay?

192
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,306
Sure! This is the
coffee shop's menu.

193
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:25,639
We tried to think of things
that would be easy for the
three of us to make.

194
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,439
[MISAKI] Mhmm...
Also, could you take a look
at our shop's layout, too?

195
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,639
Hmm... It would be better to
separate the guests from
the kitchen area.

196
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,673
Also, this menu has
too many items.

197
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,973
You should avoid using
any elaborate dishes.

198
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,273
The more requirements
there are on the kitchen,

199
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:42,106
the longer your
turnaround time will be.

200
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,339
And if you leave the finishing
touches to your waiter,

201
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,206
it will create more
interaction with the customer.

202
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:48,173
You'll kill two birds
with one stone.

203
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:51,273
Wow, Misaki, you sound like
some kinda expert?

204
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,539
Th‐that's because my younger
sister works at a coffee shop!

205
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,139
Ah‐choo.

206
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:01,806
Not yet, huh?

207
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:04,273
(Boys laughing)
Wahoo!

208
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:07,739
(Evil laughing)

209
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,173
Ooooo... AH!

210
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:12,673
I believe I said boys aren't
allowed to dress like monsters.

211
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:14,239
Huh? why the heck not?!

212
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,939
Because last year some idiot
latched onto one of the girls

213
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,439
and wouldn't let go of her.

214
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,973
We'd never do that!

215
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:20,873
Right?

216
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:23,073
(Girl screaming)
(Boy Laughing)

217
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,406
GOTCHA!

218
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:25,573
[BOY]
You're mine now!

219
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:26,906
[MISAKI]
Oh, really?

220
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:27,906
(Scared)

221
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,473
[MISAKI]
You got some kinda death wish?

222
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:30,706
Huh?

223
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,773
(Growl)

224
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,239
(Screaming)

225
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,139
You better run.

226
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,973
Misaki!

227
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,639
We look super scary, right?

228
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:43,673
Y‐yeah, super...
scary...

229
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:46,239
I hope I didn't
frighten you too much.

230
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,206
But I spent weeks studying
horror movies just to get
into character for this.

231
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:52,939
Are you sure it's okay to
blow‐off the boys of 2‐2?

232
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,206
They seemed pretty mad
when you said they
couldn't use their idea.

233
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,506
They'll get over it‐

234
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,439
I'm sure they're off having
another stupid meeting.

235
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,139
(Whispering)

236
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,639
This is perfect.

237
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:09,373
I know, right?
We should've done this
in the first place!

238
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:10,839
(Evil laughing)

239
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:13,506
I can't wait to see the look
on the president's face!

240
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,806
(Evil cackling)

241
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,173
Sakura's got a point‐

242
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:39,006
I can't imagine those dimwits
from 2‐2 giving up
without a fight.

243
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:41,706
Ooh!

244
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:44,006
Yes, yes! That's EXACTLY
what I've been looking for!

245
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:46,406
A cool but guarded,
intellectual maid,

246
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:49,273
a new character who will devote
herself to her master,
body, mind, and soul!

247
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,806
If this isn't the perfect
strategy I don't know what is!

248
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,473
"Character"?
"Strategy"?

249
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,473
Oh, Manager. You're getting
carried away again aren't you?

250
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:59,139
Quit trying to suck Misa into
your personal fantasy land!

251
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:01,639
Sorry. I couldn't follow
what you were saying at all.

252
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,606
That's fine‐ in fact,
it's better that you
don't know, Misa!

253
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:07,839
That slow but innocent nature
really suits your character!

254
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:09,873
We're so lucky to
have you at our shop!

255
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:11,573
[MISAKI]
I have no idea what
she's talking about...

256
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:14,673
Manager, I think that's enough
of that for one day. Okay?

257
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:19,806
It's not like Misa actually
cares about this job
or any of us anyway.

258
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,106
Honoka may look cute but she
has a bit of a dark side.

259
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:27,139
Don't let it
get to you, Misa.

260
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:31,639
I know that working at a place
like this isn't ideal for you,

261
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:35,706
but you're a hard worker
and a big help, too.

262
00:12:35,806 --> 00:12:38,973
Personally, I love
everything about this job.

263
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:41,939
Making dreams come true,
making people happy,

264
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:46,239
and having a fun time together
is really wonderful,
don't you think?

265
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:52,006
And in order to make others
happy, WE have to be happy, too!

266
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,773
I guess that's why I get
so carried away!

267
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,206
Sorry if I get out of hand!

268
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:08,573
Man, they must think that
I really don't care about
this job at all.

269
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:10,006
[USUI]
Who does?

270
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,906
Ugh!

271
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:13,406
You're here again?!

272
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,973
What's with that reaction, Misa?

273
00:13:15,073 --> 00:13:17,239
If you're looking to kill time,
go bother someone else.

274
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,773
Can't I get a little
of your time?

275
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:23,873
Ah!
Those are awfully
fancy panties.

276
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,573
That's sexual harrassment!

277
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:27,206
And they're DRAWERS
not panties!

278
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,739
There's no need to yell.

279
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,206
This is why I hate men!

280
00:13:31,306 --> 00:13:32,739
You think you can just do
whatever you want to women,

281
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,206
regardless of whether
they hate it or not!

282
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:35,006
You're all the same!

283
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,306
How prejudiced. Haha!

284
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:38,206
Because of people like you!

285
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:42,306
Miss President if you treat all
men like they're your enemies,

286
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:45,173
then don't you think they'll
treat you like an enemy as well?

287
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:46,339
I don't care!

288
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,773
I hate them so being their
"enemy" is fine by me!

289
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:51,873
Well, okay then.

290
00:13:51,973 --> 00:13:53,339
I'm just saying you
should be careful,

291
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:56,073
or you're gonna dig yourself
into a deep hole.

292
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:02,873
What's with him?

293
00:14:07,873 --> 00:14:09,273
[MISAKI]
The school festival
is finally here.

294
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,839
This time next year,

295
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,673
whether our school's
transformation is
successful or not

296
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,573
will depend on how hard
you work today!

297
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:15,639
Yes, Ma'am!

298
00:14:15,739 --> 00:14:17,373
So let's do our best, okay?

299
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:18,406
Yes, Ma'am!

300
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,073
[YUKIMURA]
Welcome!

301
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:22,639
Welcome to the Seika High
School Festival!

302
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,139
[BOY]
So many girls!

303
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:28,906
[BOY]
Thanks very much!

304
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:33,273
(Happy giggle)

305
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,339
(Guitar tuning)

306
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,673
[IWAKURA]
Hey!

307
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,206
Everyone suited up
and ready to go?

308
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:40,406
Sir!

309
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,173
This is the day that we've all
worked so hard for!

310
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,273
We even had to sew
our own costumes by hand!

311
00:14:44,373 --> 00:14:46,439
We're not gonna let
the president boss us
around any more.

312
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:49,439
If we pull this off,
we'll finally beat her
once and for all!

313
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:51,906
Ah! U‐Usui! It's you!

314
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,806
So which of these...
is mine?

315
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,806
You really mean it?!
Yeah!

316
00:14:55,906 --> 00:14:58,106
Now we can't possibly lose!

317
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,873
Uh... This doesn't really fit...

318
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:06,306
It's not bad,
but it's not good either.

319
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,339
[USUI]
Why can't I just be
a samurai, too?

320
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:10,673
Is this it?

321
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,173
We have a winner.

322
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:14,506
The sword may be a fake,
but he looks like the real deal!

323
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:15,939
So I'll have to...

324
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,039
...wear one of
these too, right?

325
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,306
No way!

326
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:21,339
Hurry‐ someone find
something that suits him!

327
00:15:21,439 --> 00:15:22,706
Go, men!

328
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,673
Thanks a lot!
Come back, okay!

329
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,639
Uh, what I meant was...
Please come again!

330
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,639
That's really what I meant.
Gotta be polite...

331
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:33,806
One takoyaki please.

332
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:34,739
Welcome, valued customer.

333
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:35,606
That looks delicious!

334
00:15:35,706 --> 00:15:36,939
I know, right?

335
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,506
Looks like giving the guys
a strict lecture

336
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:41,006
on how to appeal to the girls
really ended up paying off.

337
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,406
I'm going to check on
the 2nd years.

338
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,773
Kay!

339
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:47,339
It's suspicious that the boys
of 2‐2 never complained,

340
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,606
but maybe they just gave up.

341
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:50,973
Ah!

342
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,406
Huh?

343
00:15:53,173 --> 00:15:54,839
(Girls nervous)

344
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,373
[MISAKI]
What the HELL is this?!

345
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:02,773
M‐Misaki, it's terrible!

346
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:04,906
These guys barged in out
of nowhere and took over!

347
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,973
They said this is
their "territory" now!

348
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:08,706
What does that mean?!

349
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:10,539
[USUI]
It means...

350
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,273
This place is now an all‐male,
military cosplay coffee shop.

351
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,639
Obviously.

352
00:16:15,739 --> 00:16:18,773
It sounded interesting,
so I joined in.

353
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:20,473
Get back, you!

354
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,539
Careful, or I'll
see up your skirt.

355
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,239
We bring you prisoners of war!

356
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:26,506
Your human rights
will be protected.

357
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,173
So just sit quietly and order
your drinks and you'll be f‐

358
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:29,773
Ah!

359
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,039
(Grunting)

360
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:35,039
All of you...
in the hallway‐ NOW.

361
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,739
Just what do you
think you're doing?!

362
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:38,239
What's the problem?

363
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:40,206
It's a cosplay coffee shop
like you wanted, right?

364
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:42,573
We even listened to
the girl's opinions!

365
00:16:42,673 --> 00:16:44,239
We wanna enjoy
the school festival, too!

366
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,506
There are other ways
to enjoy it, aren't there?!

367
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:51,073
Why don't you make yourselves
useful instead of acting
like a bunch of idiots?!

368
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:53,206
Screw you.

369
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,939
You really think we're
gonna do what you say

370
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,439
when you order us around with
that kinda of bitchy attitude?

371
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,106
It doesn't matter what we say.
She never listens to us.

372
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,006
After all, Miss President
hates all the guys, right?

373
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,639
Let's go.

374
00:17:05,739 --> 00:17:08,706
[WAITRESS]
I'm sorry, I'll go
get it right now!

375
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,239
[CUSTOMER]
Uh, this isn't
what I ordered...

376
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,639
Can I just go ahead
and leave now?

377
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:15,273
Please wait
just a little longer.

378
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,106
But they've got a point...

379
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:20,773
don't you think you should
take the guys' opinions
into consideration, too?

380
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,139
I'm just saying
you should be careful

381
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,739
or you're gonna dig
yourself into a deep hole.

382
00:17:24,773 --> 00:17:26,206
[MISAKI]
He's right...

383
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,439
This... it's all my fault.

384
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,873
Wait a minute...

385
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:34,206
Please wait.

386
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:35,739
Huh?

387
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,239
Please help us with
the coffee shop.

388
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,006
I'm asking you!

389
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:45,739
[IWAKURA]
It's too late for that.

390
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:57,606
I'm sorry.
I'll help out.

391
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,139
I'll apologize properly later.

392
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:02,139
Right now, we have to get
this situation under control.

393
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,973
Here's your iced tea‐
enjoy, okay?

394
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:08,139
What can I get for you
today, young lady?

395
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:10,906
I'm sorry, if you could please
wait just a little longer...

396
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,206
Misaki... looks like
some kinda professional!

397
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:17,539
[MISAKI]
Alright, that's one coffee.
Would you like cream and
sugar with that?

398
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,539
[IWAKURA]
Huh? Usui?

399
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,773
[GONDA]
You're going in?

400
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,939
Our president needs help.

401
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:24,706
One cheese tart and
a lemon tea, right?

402
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,006
Will that be all for you?

403
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,606
I'd like to
order, please.

404
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,906
What can I get for
you today, Master?

405
00:18:30,006 --> 00:18:31,139
Uh...

406
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:32,506
Huh?

407
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:36,006
Oh, crap!
I said it reflexively!

408
00:18:40,173 --> 00:18:41,339
Excuse me, miss.

409
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:44,373
Might I offer you another
cup of coffee... young lady?

410
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:49,073
Usui...

411
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,973
I‐I'd like to
order too, please.

412
00:18:51,073 --> 00:18:54,539
How about you, sir?
What would you like?

413
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,639
What're your spacing out for?

414
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,339
After all, you are a maid...

415
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:01,939
so please devote yourself
to your duties fully.

416
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,839
Right away, sir.

417
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,439
That looks like fun!

418
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:09,173
We wanna help, too!

419
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,694
Behold, Princesses!

420
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:15,094
This assortment of candy
and other crap!

421
00:19:15,194 --> 00:19:17,461
Here's a refill on your
Iced Tea ration, ma'am.

422
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:19,827
May I take your orders,
m'lord and lady!

423
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,594
[IWAKURA]
Best coffee shop ever!

424
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,127
[GONDA]
This candy is the best!

425
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,227
[SUDO]
I know, right. I love how
everybody is so chill.

426
00:19:25,327 --> 00:19:26,394
That looks kinda fun!

427
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:27,327
That's Class 2‐2, right?

428
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:32,461
(Excited chatter)

429
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:33,761
(Happy laughing)

430
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,661
In the end things worked out.

431
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:37,594
They did.

432
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,927
Why you...!

433
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:44,094
No! They ordered us to engage
in a battle of strength I swear!

434
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:45,094
[GIRL]
No we didn't!

435
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:46,461
P‐please don't hurt us!

436
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,727
[GIRL]
You're in trouble now!
(laughing foley)

437
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:51,361
(Misaki giggles)

438
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,494
Just don't get
too carried away, okay!

439
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,261
Did she just smile at us?!

440
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,361
I think she did...!

441
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,994
It was...

442
00:19:58,094 --> 00:19:59,127
Really nice...

443
00:19:59,227 --> 00:20:01,094
We know, right!

444
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:11,527
Hello, welcome to Seika!

445
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,227
Miss President!
What happened with class 2‐2?

446
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:18,394
Everything's fine.
Anyway, I'll take over
from here.

447
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:19,927
But...

448
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:22,961
You guys haven't gotten to
enjoy the festival yet, right?

449
00:20:24,427 --> 00:20:26,127
Well? Hurry and up and go!

450
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,561
Yes ma'am!

451
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,961
It sure is exciting, huh?

452
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,827
This is our first time
visiting Seika...

453
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:34,094
Welcome...
to Seika High School!

454
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:37,227
Make sure to have plenty of fun
at the festival, okay?

455
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:38,661
Kay!

456
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:41,694
She was really pretty!

457
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,427
I think I like this school!

458
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:46,527
[SATSUKI]
Making people happy and
having a fun time together

459
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,727
is really wonderful,
don't you think?

460
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:53,794
And in order to make others
happy, WE have to be happy, too!

461
00:21:09,194 --> 00:21:12,094
Huh? Miss President?
Not going to the after party?

462
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:15,261
You startled me!
I was just taking a break.

463
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,661
Welp.
Guess I'll join you.

464
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:23,994
Usui.

465
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:27,761
Thank you for helping me, Usui.

466
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:30,961
You were right.

467
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,061
As president, I should've
taken everyone's opinions
into consideration.

468
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,794
Looks like you've helped me
realize something obvious
again, haven't you.

469
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:42,561
So you don't mind
if I tell everyone
you're a maid?

470
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:44,427
S‐stupid!
That's completely different!

471
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,294
And don't you dare
tell anyone‐!

472
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:48,027
Of course not.

473
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,127
You're all mine.

474
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,027
My maid, that is.

475
00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:59,061
[MISAKI]
Who do you think you are?!

476
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:02,027
[USUI]
I'm an admiral in the Navy.
I'm kind of a big deal.

477
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:04,061
Just shut up already!

478
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:10,794
Seeing Misa in an apron at
school was pretty great, huh?

479
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:13,027
Yeah and we got to
watch her all day long.

480
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:15,694
I hope they have another
school festival soon.

481
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,827
Maybe next time
I'll be a butler.

482
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:19,927
I'll just
ignore them.

483
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,027
[SHIROKAWA] We'll be the ones
[KUROSAKI]
...handling things this time!

484
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:54,461
I am the White God,
Naoya Shirokawa.
You can call me "Shiro."

485
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:57,327
I am the Black Lord,
Ryuunosuke Kurosaki,
also known as Kurotatsu!

486
00:23:57,427 --> 00:23:59,994
And I am the Sarasara Lord,
Ikuto Sarashina, or Ikkun!

487
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:02,561
[MISAKI]
Hold on, you three idiots! You
still have to clean the toilets!

488
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,127
[SHIROKAWA] The president!
[KUROSAKI] Three idiots"?
You're calling us that again?
[SARASHINA] Misa!

489
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,794
Last time, you just went
"Eek!" and fled without
doing your chores!

490
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,861
Your punishment is cleaning
the toilets for a week!

491
00:24:09,961 --> 00:24:11,827
[USUI]
Next time is
"Younger Sister's Day," huh?

492
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:13,427
Your sister seems like
the cute, comforting type.

493
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:16,694
[MISAKI]
Huh? Cute and comforting?
I think you're mistaken.

494
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:19,561
[BOYS]
Looking forward to it.
