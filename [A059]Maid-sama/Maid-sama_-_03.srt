1
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:36,863
[SUZUNA]
Yes, yes.

2
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:40,266
Oh. Hmm. I see.

3
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,303
Is something the matter, Misaki?

4
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,440
No, I'm just observing.
Go back to what you were doing.

5
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:52,345
Very well. If you don't mind,
I shall resume.

6
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,716
Where did all of these
magazines come from?!

7
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,384
There's no need raise
such a fuss about it.

8
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,253
I didn't buy them,
I borrowed them.

9
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,389
I bought the postcards
with funds from my club.

10
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,960
Oh. Your Sweepstakes
Club, right?

11
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,494
Would you like something, too?

12
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,797
There's a supplement set,
an assortment of canned salmon,

13
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,833
or a special Swiss Army Knife?

14
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,300
I should've known better.

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,670
There's no way I can use
her as a reference.

16
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,338
Reference for what?

17
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,241
From a maid to
a younger sister...

18
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,844
What is that even
supposed to mean?

19
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,781
A little sister is a bundle
of playful and cute!

20
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,215
A‐a "bundle"...?

21
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,184
That's right! It's exactly
the kind of character

22
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,686
our customers have been craving!

23
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:36,022
Misa, you have to do it,
you'd be perfect I just know it!

24
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,390
It's better if you
style your hair

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,025
like you did when
you were younger.

26
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,194
Yeah, I think you need to
wear pigtails or something.

27
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,464
[SATSUKI]
When talking to customers,
instead of calling them
"Master,"

28
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,867
call them "Big Brother"
or "Big Sister."

29
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,837
But you can change it
to fit your character,
like "Big Bro" and "Big Sis"!

30
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,279
[SATSUKI]
Oh! It looks even better
than I imagined!

31
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,982
So, what nickname are you
going to use, Misa?

32
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,316
Huh?

33
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,651
What are you going to
call the customers?

34
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,353
I always call them,
"Big Brother!"

35
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:11,124
Uh how about "Dude"?

36
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,493
What are you saying, Misa?

37
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:16,597
You have to say something like
"Big Brother", you hear me?!

38
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,598
B‐Big Brother?!

39
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,833
Big Brother, can you
help me change?

40
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:20,967
Like that!

41
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,136
Big Brother, can I
sleep with you?

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,304
Like that!

43
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,506
You have to say
something like that!

44
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:26,973
I'm not a
five‐year old!

45
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,542
That's Honoka for you.

46
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:31,512
She's like an expert when it
comes to the little sister type.

47
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,980
It's like a switch got
flipped, or something!

48
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,749
Now, give it a try!

49
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,117
You're a younger sister,

50
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,886
anxiously awaiting the return
of her beloved older brother!

51
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,087
Repeat after me:

52
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,189
"Big Brother,
where are you?"

53
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,192
Big... Brother...
where are you?

54
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,229
Ah! That's him at the door!

55
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,897
Th‐that's him at the door...

56
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,867
Welcome home, Big Brother!

57
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,737
Welcome home, Big Brother...

58
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,811
I‐I told you! That just doesn't
fit my personality at all...

59
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,480
This is just too much
for me to handle.

60
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,215
It's too much for you to handle?

61
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,885
If you ask me that sounds like
a lame excuse for not
doing your job.

62
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,520
Hey, Honoka!

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,189
I have been waiting for
too long to say this.

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,791
But I don't care
how hard she works,

65
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,893
or how much the customers
love her ditzy persona,

66
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,763
or the fact that she doesn't
know much about our industry‐

67
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,798
but if she was hired
to do this job,

68
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,033
then she should be able to do
what's expected of her.

69
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:32,539
Uh oh! Black Honoka's appeared!
Now no one can stop her!

70
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,808
Using your personality and
your pride as an excuse

71
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,377
to avoid doing something
you don't want to do

72
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,445
is the height of stupidity.

73
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,383
Why don't you quit acting
so spoiled, little girl?

74
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,858
[SATSUKI]
Misa!

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,761
Wait! Wait!

76
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,496
Don't pay attention
to her, Misa.

77
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:58,565
If it's too much we can
change your shift!

78
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,602
I know you'll do
better next time.
Oh, that's right!

79
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:05,171
Lookie! The next event is
a Maid Power Ranger Day!

80
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,940
I said that I wanted
to be the pink one,

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,309
but then Honoka said SHE
wanted to be the pink one,

82
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,711
and now she won't
back down!

83
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,913
What color do
you want, Misa?

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,582
Any color's fine with me.

85
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,183
Calling it a day already?

86
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,752
Usui!

87
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,287
Oh, you're the guy that
always comes to see Misa!

88
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,589
Your name's Usui, right?

89
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,758
Oh! You'd know, wouldn't you?

90
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,093
What color
suits Misa the best?

91
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,428
What color would...?

92
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,597
We're doing a Maid
Power Ranger event next!

93
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,634
What color do you think
would suit our Misa best?

94
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,802
"Maid Power Rangers"?

95
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,905
Personally, I think she's a
light purple or light blue,

96
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,074
but then there'd be overlap
with the other girls...

97
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,646
I was thinking multi‐colored
vinyl maid outfits‐
what do you say?

98
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,481
Something see‐through, I think.

99
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:49,850
Oh, hell no!
Now, now.

100
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,952
You don't have to
decide right away.

101
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:55,088
But would you think about
it for me, pretty please?!

102
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:01,061
[MISAKI]
Younger sister... cute...

[KUROSAKI]
Huh? A message to Misa in
the Maid Latte guest book?

107
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,709
[SHIROKAWA]
Forget it, Ikkun.
She's not gonna write back
to you in that thing.

108
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,578
[SARASHINA]
I won't know unless I try!

109
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,280
I'm tellin' you, man, you're
never gonna get a reply.

110
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,383
If someone saw that,
they're recognize her
handwriting right away.

111
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,653
There's no way she'd
leave any obvious
evidence like that‐

112
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,322
But what if it's something
overflowing with love...?!

113
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,724
What's with you, Ikkun?

114
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,059
You have some secret plan
to get her attention?

115
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,196
How about...
something like this.

116
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,598
It's a message‐
WITH A PICTURE.

What the hell, Ikkun?

119
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,468
I didn't know you
were so talented!

120
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,071
Well... I've been keeping it
a secret until now,

121
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,408
but the truth is,
I'm actually a closet nerd.

Ikkun, what the‐?!

123
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,147
But it's not like...
we're any different...

124
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,517
Yes, I said it!

125
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,051
Ah!

126
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,320
Huh? It's decent enough,
so I'll forgive it.

127
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,722
I've been forgiven!

128
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,455
For what?

129
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:03,624
So, about this...

130
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,158
What color would the flower be?

131
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,026
Huh?

132
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,193
F‐flower?

133
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,294
Color?

134
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,530
What are you talking‐?

135
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,532
Question:
If you had to pick a color

136
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,900
that would best describe Misa,
what would it be?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,571
You have 10 seconds. Ten, nine,
eight‐seven‐six‐five‐four‐three‐
two‐one...

138
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:22,809
I‐it has to definitely be red!
RED gives a sense of passion
and womanly strength!

139
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:25,278
Also, it stands out
against Misa's dark hair!

140
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:29,683
I say PURPLE has a sense of both
aloofness and seductiveness!

141
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,852
It's mature with
a hint of sexy!

142
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:35,556
It's gotta be black.
BLACK is the only color
for that tight body!

143
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:39,526
Add in a little lace, and...!

144
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,095
[SHIROKAWA]
In that case, I'd go with
strawberry‐pattered underwear.

145
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,098
[SARASHINA]
When the heck did we start
talking about underwear...?

[UTSUMI]
Hey, check it out.

147
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,369
It's a "little sister"
special edition.

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,004
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

149

that earlier today.

if she sees.

Doesn't this chick look like
Yukimura's sister?

a stupid drawing!

Uh, I don't know.

I'm not interested
in that 2D stuff.

the same to me.

00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,882
[MISAKI]
Yukimura.

170
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:36,650
Yes?!

171
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,284
(Screams in terror)

172
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,219
You...

173
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,988
I mean... you and...

174
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,724
your sister...

175
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,526
what kind of things...

176
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,293
What kind of things
do you talk about?!

177
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,129
Just normal things,
I guess...

178
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,632
Then what about her
is "comforting"?!

179
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,466
C‐comforting...?

180
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,103
Is she that really much
like the anime character
in the magazine?!

181
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,639
I‐I...

182
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,075
I think I'm gonna wet myself,
so please excuse me!

183
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,418
[USUI]
President?

184
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,888
Agh! I was s‐s‐simply
doing some research

185
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,524
the best way to address these
confiscated articles...

186
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,225
Oh, it's just you, Usui.

187
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,460
(sigh)

188
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,263
Well? What were
you "researching"?

189
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,198
None of your business!

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,934
Siblings?

191
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,136
Yes, I do.
Have I not mentioned it?

192
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,273
I have an older brother
and a younger sister.

193
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,741
Misaki, get this!

194
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,342
Shizuko, her brother,
AND her sister...

195
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:37,944
all have the
exact same glasses!

196
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,146
No, they're different,
they only LOOK similar.

197
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,415
And they all have
the EXACT same face!

198
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,917
That I cannot deny.

199
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,586
But we all have
different glasses.

200
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:48,321
So you have
an older brother?

201
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,122
Is something the matter?

202
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,591
Uh, no...

203
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,659
It's just, uh,
I don't have any brothers,

204
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,061
so I was wondering
what it's like.

205
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,396
D‐do you get along?

206
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:57,764
Do I get along
with my brother?

207
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,332
Well, it's not that we
don't get along...

208
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,768
That's because they're all
just like each other!

209
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,303
Just what exactly is
that supposed to mean?

210
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,304
(Giggling)

211
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,872
What about you, Sakura?

212
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,141
I've got an older sister.
And we get along SUPER well!

213
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,677
We go shopping together
all the time!

214
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,247
[MISAKI THINKING]
I see. Both Shizuko and
Sakura are younger sisters.

215
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,249
[SAKURA]
Let's all go
shopping together!

216
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,151
[MISAKI]
Sure enough, watching them
interact is somehow soothing.

217
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,286
[SAKURA]
I can't. I don't have
any allowance left.

218
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,523
[MISAKI]
But I don't think it's
just because they're
younger sisters...

219
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:27,260
Maybe the boss is trying to
make a place where people
feel at ease like this...

220
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,428
Misaki?

221
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,264
What is it?
You're staring at us.

222
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,400
Nothing. I was just thinking
how cute the two of you are.

223
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,169
Ah!
Oh!

224
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,739
Wh‐what's gotten into you?

225
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,907
Are you confessing your
forbidden love for us?

226
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,743
Wow, I'm gonna fall
in love with you, Misaki!

227
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:45,178
[MISAKI]
I have to re‐think this...

228
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,050
Can I really do it?

229
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,301
You sure about this, Ikkun?
You're really gonna draw it?

230
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,071
You know it! I've got
all 24 colors ready to go!

231
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,673
Don't tell me
you're going to‐!

232
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,907
[SARASHINA]
Yes‐ PURPLE!

233
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,676
[SHIROKAWA]
This is a bad idea.

234
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:17,143
[KUROSAKI]
If you HAVE to draw it,
forget about the colors!

235
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,145
Just do black lace!

236
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,414
[SHIROKAWA]
No, if he's going to do
anything it's going to
be a strawberry print!

237
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,049
[KUROSAKI]
Fine, we go with the
middleground: leopard print.

238
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,551
[SHIROKAWA]
What kind of
middleground is that?

239
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,452
Apologies for the wait, Masters.

240
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:30,056
Here's a special Cutesy‐Cutesy
Rice Omelette, on the house!

241
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:33,727
[SARASHINA]
Catter‐what...?

242
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,396
[KUROSAKI]
C‐catter wall...?

243
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,167
[SUBARU]
Seriously...
She's an admirably hard worker.

244
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,837
I've even seen her reading
textbooks on her break

245
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,271
while working out with
dumbells at the same time.

246
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,440
In any case, she's got
her act together, huh?

247
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,075
She's caught on
pretty quickly.

248
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,178
To be honest, I totally
hated her from day one!

249
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,581
I didn't give a damn what her
home life was like at all,

250
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,651
and the special treatment she
got really pissed me off.

251
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,786
But she lifts
heavy stuff for me,

252
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,356
and if I happen to get stuck
with a crappy customer,
for instance...

253
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,093
[MISAKI]
Master, please don't
be too hard on her.

254
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,730
The customers buy it
every single time!

255
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,533
She certainly serves her purpose
every now and then.

256
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,234
She's almost useful!

257
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,470
(Awkward laugh) Honoka,
I'd hate to be on your bad side.

258
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,075
What're you staring at?!

259
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,845
I'm observing.
To see what color you are.

260
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,681
I told you to just pick
whatever you want!

261
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,816
As long as it's
not see‐through.

262
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,987
Don't you think you're
putting a little too much
thought into all of this?

263
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:34,955
Shut it.

264
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,090
You have a younger sister,
don't you?

265
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,825
Why don't you just imagine
what she would say.

266
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,227
She would never say "Big
Brother" or anything like that!

267
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,397
And I'd never used a cutesy
voice like that in my life.

268
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:48,569
[USUI]
If you can't do it,
why not just change shifts?
Or take the day off?

269
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:53,006
[HONOKA]
Why don't you quit acting
so spoiled, little girl?

270
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,775
[MISAKI]
Saying "I can't do it"...

271
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,178
It's just a lame excuse!

272
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,515
Also, Maid Latta isn't some
normal coffee shop.

273
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,084
It's a place where you can
go have fun and experience

274
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,052
something unexpected and great.

275
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,122
Not to mention, they have
their own special atmosphere,

276
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:13,059
one that the staff has created
through hardwork and devotion.

277
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,662
I've finally noticed that.

278
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,531
That's why I'll become
this character‐

279
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,133
Why are you so concerned
about it now, though?

280
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:20,967
Huh?

281
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,168
What's that supposed to mean?!

282
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,739
I think you're fine
the way you are.

283
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,842
If you suddenly became
my younger sister...

284
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,111
What are you...?

285
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,749
That'd be...
so hot.

286
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:40,186
I'd make a collectors album
titled "365 Days of Misaki's
Sleeping Faces,"

287
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,689
and have a different angle
for every day of the week.

288
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,892
Ah! Stay away from me,
you freak!

289
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,232
(Giggle)
Welcome home, Big Brother!

290
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,466
[GIRLS]
Oh!

291
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,803
It's not perfect,
but it's still pretty good!

292
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,640
[MISAKI]
You must be tired after a long
day at work. Come sit down!

293
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,342
It sounds a little rehearsed,
but I think that overall she
passed with flying colors!

294
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,778
We'll practice with her a
bit more and she'll be perfect!

295
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:08,181
I admit she's worked hard,
but it seems she went for
the obvious Lolita‐type.

296
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,984
She could just as easily have
gone with another type,

297
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,954
such as the diligent,
prim‐and‐proper character,

298
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,190
but it seems she
really had no idea.

299
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,627
(Giggles)
Welcome home, Big Brother!

300
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,596
Uh‐uh‐oh...

301
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,102
Wh‐what's wrong?

302
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,271
What do you mean,
what's wrong with you?

303
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,739
I... uh...

304
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,341
Your calling me "Big Brother"
is freaking me out.

305
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,912
What's with the act
all of a sudden? It's weird.

306
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,413
Are you trying to
get something out of me?

307
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:43,717
Or are you feeling guilty
about something?

308
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,085
Uh...

309
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,654
C‐come on, Big Brother!
Misa's always like this‐

310
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:52,492
Are you trying to make up
for farting in front
of me the other day?

311
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:53,459
Ah!

312
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,028
[SATSUKI]
No, Misa!

313
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,197
What an amateur,
getting mad at
a customer's joke.

314
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,165
Well, it was a pretty bad joke.

315
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,604
G‐geez, Big Brother! What ever
am I going to do with you?

316
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:06,239
Here, have some WATER!

317
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,375
Where's this water from?
Your "brother" only drinks
water fresh from the Alps.

318
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,811
Go get me some.

319
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,246
There you go again,
making jokes.

320
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,348
You really got me
this time, Big Brother!

321
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,017
Anyway, what would you
like today?

322
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,085
I recommend the
cutesy‐cutesy rice omelette‐

323
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:22,222
"Big Brother" would like
roast lobster in a
white wine reduction,

324
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,224
foie gras poêlé,
a side of summer truffles,

325
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:25,992
and a bottle of your
finest champagne.

326
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:29,062
Another joke! You sure are
picking on me alot today‐

327
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,496
Cut it out already,
Big Brother!

328
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,833
Aren't you the one
who should cut it out?

329
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,301
If you're getting picked on
it's because you're
putting on this weird act.

330
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,170
You even lied about
farting in front of me.

331
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,639
I told you I didn't do that!

332
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,007
You idiot perverted
older brother!

333
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,879
Whoops‐
she finally lost it.

334
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,782
Well, Misa, you seem like
you're in a bad mood today.

335
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,617
I guess I'll just leave.

336
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,523
B‐Big Brother...

337
00:15:56,623 --> 00:16:01,261
Please... please come back and
see me again sometime, 'kay.

338
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,566
This... this is...!

339
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,667
It can't be!

340
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,635
Another type of "little sister"!

341
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,036
It's THAT!

342
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,306
Yes! It's not Lolita OR
prim‐and‐proper, it's...!

343
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,743
The air‐headed...

344
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,979
hot‐and‐cold younger sister!

345
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:21,982
Good work, everyone!

346
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:25,786
Honestly, I never expected her
to put that much work into it.

347
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:29,155
Huh? But Misa's a
hard worker to begin with.

348
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,658
Next time I want to see
more of her cute "hot" side.

349
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:35,228
I agree! We already see more
than enough of her "cold" side.

350
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,031
But, I don't think she's
suited for these events.

351
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:42,235
Because Misa's at her
absolute cutest when she's
with you‐know‐who...!

352
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,937
Aren't you gonna
say "thank you"?

353
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,305
For what?

354
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,140
You succeeded
because of me, right?

355
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,042
I wouldn't call that a success.

356
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,211
I guess I don't have
what it takes after all.

357
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,546
When I throw myself into a part

358
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:54,981
I lose my ability to make
clear judgments,

359
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,683
and I lose my temper, I guess.

360
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:59,753
That's why you
shouldn't try to play
some fake character.

361
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,321
Just be yourself.

362
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,692
But my personality isn't
"comforting" at all!

363
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:10,263
Really? I think
you'd make a great
little sister.

364
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,733
Shut up, stupid Usui!

365
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,703
[SATSUKI]
Misa's at her best
when Usui's by her side.

366
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,713
[GIRL]
Oh, look!
Upperclassman Usui showed up.

367
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,014
Best of luck!

368
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,516
Uh‐hm.

369
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,318
Do you need something?

370
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,455
Um, yes! I'm sorry for
calling you out here.

371
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:40,226
U‐um, but, there's something I
wanted to tell you in person...!

372
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,129
The truth is,
since the moment
I saw you,

373
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,798
I was in love...

374
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,700
[USUI]
Oh...

375
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,672
W‐will you please
be my boyfriend?!

376
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,574
That was close...

377
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:58,579
Upperclassman... Usui?

378
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,147
I'm a huge freak who likes
maids more than anything
else in the world.

379
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,050
All my favorites books are about
maids, I visit maid cafes
every single day,

380
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,819
and I collect
maid figurines, too.

381
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,721
My heart races every time
I play maid dating games,

382
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:09,690
and in my spare time
I dress in a maid costumes

383
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,025
and breathe heavily while
I stare at myself in a mirror.

384
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,059
See ya.

385
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,862
Huh...?

386
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,931
Don't give up!
He's just testing you!

387
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,801
There's no way that's true!

388
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,569
I don't care about that! I...

389
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,573
If you just give me a chance,
I can become your type!

390
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,778
Sorry, but I don't think so.

391
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,784
Usui! The nesxt class
is about to start.

392
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,352
Miss President...

393
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:43,857
Strip.

394
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,160
What are you...

395
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,262
...saying, you pervert?!

396
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:56,402
[USUI]
You planned on waiting
until your next break,
even though it's this bad?

397
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,772
[Masaki]
It's not like I'm
bleeding or anything.

398
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,509
That's our president for you,
rugged till the end.

399
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,779
Anyway... how did you
even know about that
to begin with?

400
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,748
Are you stalking me now?

401
00:19:07,848 --> 00:19:09,449
Don't blame it on me.

402
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,520
You're the one who
always seems to be around
no matter where I go.

403
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:15,689
It's fate.

404
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:20,393
Besides, if anyone should be
surprised, it should be me.

405
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,663
Every time I see you at school,

406
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,766
you're always standing up
for the girls and
beating up the guys.

407
00:19:25,866 --> 00:19:28,535
You're like the
main character of some
sort of romantic anime.

408
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,671
Well excuse me for not
being more ladylike!

409
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,339
And what's wrong with a woman
protecting other women?

410
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,542
I didn't say it was wrong,
did I?

411
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,843
But...

412
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:40,781
Seeing you risk yourself for
a guy was pretty unexpected.

413
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:42,315
I didn't have a choice.

414
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,718
I couldn't just let him
get hurt like that, could I?

415
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:47,921
So you're saying you'd
help out both guys and girls,

416
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,323
even if you put
yourself at risk?

417
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,593
I'd do that for anyone.

418
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,896
I'd even save YOU
if I had to, Usui.

419
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,368
I look forward to
seeing that, Misa!

420
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,739
Er! Quit making fun of me!

421
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,610
Oh, no! Misa,
what happened to your arm?!

422
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,878
[MISAKI] It's not a big deal.
[SATSUKI] It's all wrapped up
in a bandage! Are you all right?

423
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,380
It looks worse than it is,
don't worry, I'm fine I promise!

424
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,349
You sure about that?
It was pretty swollen.

425
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,251
Usui! Boys aren't
allowed back here!

426
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,822
I'm about to start my shift
anyway, so hurry up
and leave already!

427
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:22,923
Roger that.

428
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:24,490
All right, ma'am,
I'll be going.

429
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,260
Let me know right away if it
starts hurting, okay, Misa?

430
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,062
Well, guess I'll
take it from here!

431
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:32,232
Don't worry, Usui,
she's in good hands,
so just leave her to me!

432
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,600
Yeah. But watch out,

433
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,736
she's the kind of person
who puts on a brave face

434
00:20:35,836 --> 00:20:37,638
and doesn't like to
take help from others.

435
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,406
So make sure you're discreet
or she'll catch on.

436
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,509
(Satsuki giggles)

437
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,679
Oh, no! Where'd all these
flowers come from?

438
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,517
It's a lot of trouble for you,
isn't it, Usui?

439
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:56,690
Not really. I'm enjoying myself,
so it's no trouble at all.

440
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,158
Is that so?

441
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,860
I guess it would be kinda fun

442
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,428
just to watch someone who's as
hard of a worker as Misa is.

443
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,565
She puts her all into
everything she does,

444
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:07,668
and even though sometimes
she can't do what she
sets her mind to,

445
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,703
she pushes herself to
her absolute limit

446
00:21:09,803 --> 00:21:12,272
and then you end up getting
worried about her, right?

447
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,975
(Misaki wheezing)
One day I WILL overtake you!

448
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:17,744
[SATSUKI]
Not only is she a splendid
and capable young lady,

449
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,345
but she's so determined
to get better

450
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,281
that it makes it hard to
take your eyes off her.

451
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,849
It's like,
she gives you power,

452
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,351
and the drive to say,
"I can do better, too!"

453
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,655
That's what you enjoy
the most, right, Usui?

454
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,424
Hm.

455
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,996
By the way, I thought about
what Misa's color should be.

456
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:37,397
Ah!

457
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,200
Someone like her can't
just be a single color.

458
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,803
So that's why she's...

459
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,004
Definitely white.

460
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:46,206
Huh. I didn't expect that.

461
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,374
Geez, Usui, what're you
still here for?!

462
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,844
I told you to
hurry up and leave!

463
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:53,013
But it's also...

464
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:56,650
The type of color that
takes on other colors, too.

465
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,952
[MISAKI]
What are you
talking about?
[SATSUKI] Cute overload!

466
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,186
Ah, now you're red.

467
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,756
Oh no‐ it's a cutesy
flower overload!

468
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,729
So cool! White Misa's the best!

469
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,964
Defeat me with your love!

470
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:11,898
(Grunts)

471
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,399
Us, too! Us, too!

472
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,669
All right then, who's next?

473
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,104
Uh, actually, I'm starting
to have second thoughts.

474
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,773
Me, too.

475
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,266
[SATSUKI]
Oh, no! I STILL can't
hold back the cutesy flowers!

476
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,269
[MISAKI]
Ma'am, it's really a shame
to have this event just once.

477
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,006
[SATSUKI]
We'll do it again sometime!
Look forward to
Younger Sister Day Part II!

478
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,875
[USUI]
Use something transparent
and revealing.

479
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,044
[MISAKI]
Quit saying that!
Just shut up, Usui.

480
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,580
Say, ma'am, are you a
younger sister, too?

481
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,181
[SATSUKI]
Yes! I have an older brother.

482
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,283
[HONOKA]
Manager! A cute girl
decked out in frilly clothes

483
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,018
just walked into the café!

484
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:12,986
[MISAKI]
You're right.

485
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,087
[SATSUKI]
She's here!

486
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,656
[USUI]
Misa, you're sooo cute.

487
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:18,525
[MISAKI]
Usui, just shut up.
