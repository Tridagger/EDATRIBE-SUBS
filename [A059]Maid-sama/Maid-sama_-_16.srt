1
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,264
(laughter)

2
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,805
[SARASHINA]
Yay, it's summer vacation!

3
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,708
We're gonna go to Maid Latte
every single dayyy!

4
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,043
[SHIROKAWA]
As long as we get our summer
allowance,

5
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,912
we can go whenever we want!

6
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,380
[KUROSAKI]
Our spirit is hotter than
the hottest summer,

7
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,184
and it's screaming that
we'll make this a summer
to never forget!

8
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,153
[TRIO]
Gah!

9
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,825
[SHIROKAWA]
WHYYYYYY?!

10
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,198
[TRIO]
Misaaaa!

11
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,772
[HONOKA]
It's so hot! I can't
take it anymore...!

12
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:24,244
[SATSUKI]
It's just a little bit further.
Hang in there, Honoka.

13
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,048
Ugh... I never should have
agreed to come on this "company
trip" in the first place!

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:33,319
Come on, don't say that. After
all, Satsuki's younger sister
was kind enough to invite us.

15
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,421
That's right.
No complaining!

16
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,991
Huh? Where'd
Misa run off to?

17
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,760
Over there.

18
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,128
[HONOKA]
Whoa. When'd she
get so far ahead?

19
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,931
Amazing!

20
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,870
[MISAKI]
It's the beach!

21
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:06,486
[SUZUNA]
I cut the slices extra
big. Wow, how fancy.

22
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:12,392
Still... Sis went on a
trip to the beach. And
Mom is busy working.

23
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:17,463
I didn't think I'd win all this
stuff. What should I do if I
can't finish it by myself?

24
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,800
(chomp)
Oh, that's right!

25
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,769
I should call everyone from
the Sweepstakes Club. Ulp.

26
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,605
After I eat this, of course.

27
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:29,309
(chewing and spitting out seeds)

28
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,711
[NAGISA]
Welcome!

29
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,946
It sure has been
a long time hasn't it, Big Sis?

30
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,282
[SATSUKI] Nagisa! Have
you been doing okay?
[ERIKA] Sh‐She's so tan!
[NAGISA] Yup!

31
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,752
[Misaki] A tan Manager...
[Satsuki] You're the owner of
Beach House! That's awesome!

32
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,121
[NAGISA]
But Sis, you have
your own place, too!

33
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,659
Thanks for coming out, everyone.
You're welcome to rest up before
heading down to the water.

34
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,093
[ALL]
Okay!

35
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,361
[NAGISA]
I'll take your luggage.

36
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,496
Thank you very
much, ma'am.

37
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,501
(gasping & laughing)

38
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,469
[HONOKA]
What a beautiful view!

39
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,639
[SATSUKI]
Oh! This place just
started up this year.

40
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,306
[ERIKA]
Look! There are chairs
on the terrace.

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,810
Oh... What a
nice breeze...

42
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,912
[AOI]
Are you stupid?

43
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,549
You girls work at a maid café.

44
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,651
This place is brimming with
harmful UV rays...

45
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,788
Don't you think you should at
least make an effort to take
better care of your skin? Huh?

46
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:15,922
Aoi?!

47
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,958
[SUBARU, voiceover]
Aoi Hyoudou, 14 years old.

48
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,562
The owner's nephew, who
became popular as Aoi,
the Internet celebrity.

49
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,664
Sex: Male.
Hobby: Dressing in drag.

50
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,966
[MISAKI]
Don't tell me you've
been thrown out again!

51
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:29,335
[HONOKA]
He's probably just here to prey
on unsuspecting beach goers.

52
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,005
Darn it, Aoi!

53
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,807
You're dressing
like this AGAIN?

54
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,408
Hey, give that back!

55
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,210
[NAGISA] This is
the beach you know.
(AOI growling)

56
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,746
[Nagisa]
The way you dress, I get hot
just looking at you, cut it out!

57
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,783
My older brother dropped him off
here hoping he'd get a little
more manly...

58
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,818
looks like it's had
the opposite effect.

59
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:45,786
So I can see.

60
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,487
(beach chatter)

61
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,791
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

62
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,293
Oh, President.

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,530
Why the heck are you
here, too, Usui?

64
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,100
I told you. The manager
asked me to come.

65
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,968
She wanted me
to be the bodyguard.

66
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,236
Gweh!

67
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,771
Even though it's way
too hot outside,

68
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,740
I had to get up early
and came all the way
here. (yawn)

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,209
If you didn't feel like doing
it, then why did agree to?

70
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,913
If it's for you, I'll
do anything. You know
that, Misa. Besides...

71
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:18,985
If you happen to drown out
there, I can't very well let
some other random guy give you
mouth‐to‐mouth, now can I?

72
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,823
(slap)
Well, I'm off to the
beach. Time to swim!

73
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,928
Okay, Usui, we're gonna go
ahead and get changed now.

74
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,131
You really are excited,
aren't you, Misa?

75
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,767
[MISAKI]
Well, actually my mom gave me
some weird speech about

76
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:37,037
occasionally "acting like a
normal high‐school student"
or something.

77
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,707
It's been a while since I've
done something fun, so I figured
I might as well go all‐out.

78
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,610
You really give your all at
everything you do, don't you?

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,712
Uh, Misa? What's with
that bathing suit?

80
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,414
Okay guys, I'm
heading out first!

81
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,660
[MISAKI]
Hey, everyone!
The water feels great!

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,995
[GIRLS]
That's her school
bathing suit...

83
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,064
[MISAKI] Aren't
you going to swim?
[SUBARU] Guess
that's no surprise.

84
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,832
[MISAKI] It's the greatest
[SUBARU] Bathing suits are
pretty expensive.

85
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,234
Yeah but does she really have
to wear her swimming cap?

86
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,671
[Honoka] As long as she can swim
and have a good time, who cares?
[Misaki] Come on, everyone!

87
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,138
Yeah, that's Misa
for you, all right.

88
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,609
It looks like she's
really loving the beach.

89
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,844
[ERIKA]
Whoa, some one looks
incredibly dejected...

90
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,880
I bet he was really looking
forward to this.

91
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,649
[SUBARU] Well... at least
he's at the beach.
(USUI muttering to himself)

92
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,850
But he...

93
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,219
[GIRL A]
Hey, are you alone?
You wanna hang out?

94
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,791
[GIRL B]
We don't have enough people to
do beach volleyball. Wanna play
with us?

95
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,894
[SUBARU]
He really isn't interested
in anyone but Misa.

96
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,002
[MISAKI]
How long has it been since
I've been to the beach?

97
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:46,540
Elementary school? Before that,
when I went gathering shells?

98
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,611
Okay! I'm gonna enjoy this! Uh?

99
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,654
[NAGISA]
That's right. This place is
actually completely in the red.

100
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,723
Yeah, the location
really isn't that great.

101
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,825
It's at the very
end of the beach.

102
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,127
Plus it's the only one
out here on its own.

103
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:10,797
[NAGISA]
Newcomers here always have
trouble getting the good spots.

104
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,501
[SUBARU]
The place itself is
so clean and new...

105
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,237
Surely there's
something she can do?

106
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,974
[AOI] A crappy place like this
could never get popular!
[GIRLS] Huh?

107
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:23,877
Hurry up and go bankrupt.
Then I can finally go back home.

108
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,313
[SATSUKI] Aoi!
[GIRLS] He actually looks
like a boy for once!

109
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,217
[NAGISA]
You've got some nerve.
'Specially when you wear
something like this.

110
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,319
Gah! Give that back!

111
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,589
I said you'd get it when you
were done working, didn't I?
(AOI struggling)

112
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,625
But won't you be in trouble
in you don't find some sort
of solution soon?

113
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,794
[AOI] Let go of me!
[NAGISA] Yeah, you're right.

114
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,864
[AOI] Give it back,
give it back...
[NAGISA] If only there was
something that would make up

115
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,032
I might have a chance
at saving the place...

116
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,968
[MISAKI]
In that case... it'd
have to be something

117
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,504
that really jumps out
and grabs your attention.

118
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,140
Something that no one
else on the beach has...

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,676
Uh? Guys?

120
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,443
(menacing laughter)

121
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,680
No matter what the
situation we always have...

122
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,884
A secret weapon that
only we can use, right?
(gleam! laughing continues)

123
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,954
Huh? Wait Uh... You
can't be serious! This
is a terrible idea!

124
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,592
Alright then girls:
let's do this thing.

125
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,827
[HONOKA]
Are you ready?

126
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,631
Hello Masters, welcome
to our beach house.

127
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,901
[HONOKA]
Let's walk along the beach
to get the word out.

128
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,337
[SATSUKI]
Does everyone know what to do
if you run into any weirdos?

129
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,773
[ERIKA]
Just politely ignore them.

130
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,110
Hmph. Looks like this calls for
a guest appearance by Aoi. Ah!

131
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,914
[NAGISA]
Hey! Didn't I tell you to go
clean out the shower area?

132
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,215
[MISAKI]
Nagisa!

133
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,818
Are you all right with
them taking over like this?

134
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,086
Sure, why not?
It sounds like fun.

135
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,789
[NAGISA] It'll be a one‐day
event, just for today only.
[MISAKI] Uh...

136
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,358
[NAGISA]
Tomorrow, things will
go back to normal.

137
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:48,194
If everything goes well they
might be able to grab enough
attention

138
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,063
to keep this place in business.

139
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,265
Besides, they offered their
services for free,

140
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,668
so as far as I'm concerned
they can do whatever they want.

141
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:58,304
[Nagisa] Call me if
something comes up, okay?
[Aoi] Ow. AH! Hey, let go of me!

142
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:03,777
Basically... she doesn't care?!

143
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,682
[USUI]
Grumble grumble,
grumble grumble...

144
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:16,056
For today only, a real, live
maid café is open right here
on this very beach!

145
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,026
Master, My Lady, please
feel free to stop by and
pay us a visit.

146
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,395
I'll be waiting for you
at the beach house.

147
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:26,166
[GON‐CHAN]
Master, would you and the
Madame like to accompany me?

148
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,670
[SAYU]
We'll have a
limited‐time only menu.

149
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,573
[MISAKI, THINKING]
Is this really okay...?

150
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,446
(fuming) Geez, this sucks!
It's not like anyone even
uses this anyway,

151
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:44,718
so why do I have to do clean
NOW, when the sun's at the
highest point in the sky!? Oh?

152
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,887
Need a hand there?

153
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,289
How about I help you
out with the cleaning?

154
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,791
What's up with you?

155
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,226
Heh... Well, today...

156
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,596
I was thinking about helping
out from behind the scenes.

157
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,566
Hmph! Did you finally
become aware of your own
utter lack of sexiness?

158
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,235
Your swimsuit is so plain
and boring it's pitiful!

159
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,106
Uh, so I thought I could take
care of the cleaning outside.

160
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,842
You have more stuff you need
to do inside, don't you?

161
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,278
Fine, whatever. Just make sure
you do a good job, got it?

162
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,680
Don't you worry!

163
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,116
Now hurry up or you're
gonna get sunburned.

164
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,530
You shriveled
old raisin! Ahhh!

165
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,164
Raisin?!

166
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,172
Wow, he really
does hate me, huh?

167
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,955
[BOY A]
Is the place you
were talkin' about?

168
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,924
[BOY B]
Yeah, this is it. The
Maid Beach House. Huh?!

169
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,694
Hello there, Masters.
Welcome to the Beach House!

170
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,262
[BOY B]
Uh, hi.

171
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,065
Please feel free to relax
in the shade, my Masters.

172
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,600
[BOY A]
Okay.

173
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,736
Can I interest either one of
you in a refreshing beverage?

174
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,471
Iced coffee for me.

175
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,973
I'll have
an iced tea.

176
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,708
I'll be back with
your drinks shortly.

177
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,410
So this is what a
maid café's like, huh?

178
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,680
I've always wanted to go to one,
but I never thought

179
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,982
there'd be one at a beach
house. Kna' wha'm sayin'.

180
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,217
Good thing we came
to the beach, right?

181
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,852
Right!

182
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,156
Huh?

183
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,961
Uh!

184
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,630
[SUBARU]
My apologies for the wait.

185
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,898
[GON‐CHAN]
Understood, My Lady.

186
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,566
[GIRL A]
She called me "My Lady"!

187
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,702
[GIRL B]
They're so polite here!

188
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:46,339
Our special, today‐only
"Beach Mini‐cake Set."

189
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:51,011
My Ladies, would you care
for a free heated shower?

190
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:55,649
(laughing) Here are your
cold drinks. Please enjoy!

191
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,985
[GON‐CHAN]
Please let me know when you
have decided your order.

192
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,155
[SAYU]
Master, allow me to
show you to your seat.

193
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,894
[SUBARU]
Would you care for a half‐sized
order for the young Master?

194
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,805
It's way too hot.

195
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,184
Ah! Usui!

196
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:37,457
You were here the whole time?!
That was close! WAY too close!

197
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,959
Misa, what are you wearing?

198
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,928
Well, Manager said...

199
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,131
I'll help out, too! Do you have
another apron I can borrow?

200
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,602
Thanks, Misa... I'm
sorry, this was supposed
to be a vacation.

201
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,706
Think nothing of it! You
always do so much for me.

202
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,041
Well, if you really don't
mind...

203
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,477
Your school swimsuit
kind of sticks out,

204
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:59,445
So I'll lend you this one, okay?

205
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:02,849
Uh, yeah...

206
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,918
I couldn't exactly
refuse her.

207
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,421
They've got a lot of customers
right now, so I've got to do
what I can to help out.

208
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,457
Are you saying, you intend to
go out there dressed like that?

209
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:15,028
Huh? Of course I do. That's why
I changed in the first place.

210
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:18,699
Why don't you try giving us a
hand instead of lying around?

211
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,234
Look, I've got to get down there
before thing start getting out
of hand.

212
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,704
All the seats are full and the
orders are starting to pile up.

213
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,438
[MISAKI] I better hurry.
[USUI] Ayuzawa.

214
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,814
[MISAKI]
Stop it!

215
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,116
What are you doing?!

216
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,852
(chuckling) So you're
all right, Misa?

217
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:42,989
With everyone seeing that
huge hickey smack dab in
the middle of your back?

218
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,793
[SATSUKI] Huh?
[SAYU] Thank you for coming.

219
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:49,863
[ERIKA] My apologies
for the wait.
[SATSUKI] Misa what happened?

220
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,301
I'm sorry, Manager. Please allow
me to wear this outfit instead.

221
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,369
[SATSUKI]
What?

222
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,104
Quit standing there!
You help out, too!

223
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,440
I am helping out,
I'm being your bodyguard.

224
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,609
(SATSUKI giggling)

225
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,290
Thanks for all of your
hard work today. Cheers!

226
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,192
(together)
Great work, everyone!

227
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,927
[NAGISA]
Eat as much as you like.

228
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,462
[MISAKI]
Wow, thank you so much!

229
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,531
[NAGISA]
I should be the one
thanking you guys.

230
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,534
Because of you, this place was
packed for the first time since
it opened!

231
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:32,038
There were so many people here
it was crazy‐ I don't know how
you do it, Big Sis!

232
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,140
It's all thanks to
my wonderful staff.

233
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,909
(giggling)

234
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,912
[AOI] Hmph.

235
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,180
[SATSUKI]
Here, take this.

236
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,682
They're free tickets
to a hot spring.

237
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:42,983
A hot spring?

238
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,150
There's one nearby!

239
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,819
it's so close you
can walk there.

240
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,087
Wow.

241
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,222
Let's all go once
we're done eating.

242
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,324
First we go to the beach,
and now a hot spring?

243
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,727
I think this is the best
summer of my entire life!

244
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:57,097
This side of the coast is
famous for its hot springs.

245
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,632
(MISAKI happily giggles
and HONOKA laughs)

246
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,669
Huh? What's so funny, Honoka?

247
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:08,108
This area... is actually
famous because it's HAUNTED.

248
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,311
Huh? Did you just say "haunted"?

249
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,014
[HONOKA]
That's right. They say that a
couple made a promise

250
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:18,719
to throw themselves from
these very cliffs, and die
tragically together.

251
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:23,957
However, the guy had another
girlfriend, and at the last
minute he pulled back,

252
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:29,095
leaving the girl to plummet
to her doom, alone.

253
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,298
Her body was never found. A few
months later,

254
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:38,572
an unsuspecting couple visiting
the area happened upon the exact
same cliff where... they saw it.

255
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:42,576
[MISAKI]
Saw what? Ulp...
What did they see?

256
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:47,981
[HONOKA]
Emerging from the dark water,
crawling up the cliff at an
impossible speed...

257
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,051
a woman covered in blood!
(MISAKIs screaming)

258
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,319
Ever since then, all sorts of
ghost sightings and mysterious
encounters

259
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,089
have been reported along
the seashore and in the
surrounding area.

260
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,859
Aah, I wanna
see one, too...

261
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,163
Ulp. Th‐that's just an
urban legend‐ there's no
way any of that's true!

262
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,132
Oh really? Do you know...

263
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:11,738
why there are so many
sightings in this area?
(laughter)

264
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,374
Because there really
ARE ghosts here.

265
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,742
(MISAKI scared)

266
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,916
Okay, guys! It's
hot spring time!

267
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,217
[ALL] Okay!
(MISAKI still frightened)

268
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,652
I love that it's within
walking distance‐

269
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,987
that's so convenient.

270
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,289
Let's bathe naked so
we can really enjoy it!

271
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:32,659
[MISAKI]
I agree... GAH!

272
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,596
[MISAKI, thinking]
Naked?! My back! They'll see IT!

273
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,298
(GIRLS squealing)

274
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:44,270
[MISAKI]
Um... I think I'm
going to have to pass.

275
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,939
[SATSUKI]
Huh? Why, Misa?

276
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,974
[MISAKI]
I'm not feeling too good.

277
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,375
(concerned)

278
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,912
Well... we don't want
to force you...

279
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,515
I'll just stay here and
keep an eye on things.

280
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:58,685
[SATSUKI]
Well, we'll be back later!

281
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:10,396
[USUI]
Misa‐?

282
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,146
This is your
fault. Stupid Usui!

283
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,883
If you hadn't put that hickey
on me, I could be out having
fun with everyone else!

284
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:33,053
Well, why do you think I
stayed behind with you, Misa?

285
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:37,257
I don't know and I don't care!
If you think that's gonna make
up for your crime you're wrong!

286
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:40,260
My "crime"? You wanted
to go that badly?

287
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,196
Of course! I hadn't been
on vacation in so long.

288
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,398
I wanted to have as
much fun as I could.

289
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,369
It's not every day you
get to go to a hot spring
for free. Also...

290
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:53,540
Being with everyone...
helped keep me distracted...

291
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,177
Are you scared...
of ghosts?

292
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,780
No, I'm not! Where'd
you get that idea?!

293
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,250
I just didn't want to waste
those free tickets that the
manager had is all...! Huh?

294
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:10,190
What the...? Manager! How
could you forget the tickets?!

295
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,562
[MISAKI] Manager! Manager! (sob)
[USUI] So much for the free
coupons. Looks like no one's
going to get to use them

296
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,498
If I start running now,
I should be able to catch them.

297
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,333
Usui! Stay here
and watch the place!

298
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,135
Huh? You're going
to chase them down?

299
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,805
Do you really have to go
to all that trouble just
for some tickets?

300
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,307
[MISAKI]
What are you talking about?
These aren't just any tickets!

301
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,743
They're FREE tickets! They get
you into hot springs that

302
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,345
normally you'd have to pay
money for, but for free!

303
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,848
I can't just let something
like that go to waste.

304
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,583
What if you run
into a ghost?

305
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,721
Uh?! Ulp. That's
not scary at all.

306
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:45,859
After all, I‐I don't b‐believe
in such r‐ridiculous, childish
things.

307
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,199
Hmm...

308
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:07,480
That's right there's nothing to
be afraid of! It's not like any
of that stuff actually exists!

309
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:13,554
Besides, I can't let everyone
waste their money like that
when there's no reason to!
That's just stupid!

310
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:18,358
[HONOKA]
This area... is actually
famous because it's HAUNTED!

311
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:24,765
(laughing) There's no way ghosts
are real... I've never even seen
one, not once in my entire life!

312
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,836
There's no way I could believe
in... (heavy breathing)

313
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:39,212
Uh oh. This is bad. (nervous
laughter) Where exactly am I?

314
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,364
(screaming)

315
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,904
(scared breaths)

316
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:21,487
(panicked breathing)
What the heck?
It's just you Usui?

317
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,593
I'm sorry... I didn't
mean to scare you.

318
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,863
I locked the beach house up
and thought I'd come with you.

319
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,565
Can you stand?

320
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:39,405
You really...
are troublesome.

321
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,411
Huh? What?

322
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:52,653
You're completely
limp, Ayuzawa.

323
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,289
[USUI]
You still scared?

324
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,091
[MISAKI]
You're making fun of me again.

325
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,760
[USUI]
I'm not.

326
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,828
[MISAKI]
You're going to use this against
me later, aren't you?

327
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,098
(USUI chuckling)
[MISAKI] Dammit, let
go of me already.

328
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:09,736
[USUI]
I won't let go. I'll hold you
until you've calmed down.

329
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:17,711
[MISAKI]
What does that mean?
Stupid Usui.

330
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,980
What do you think you're doing?!
(MISAKI screaming)

331
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,117
Geez give me a break.
Can't you find somewhere
else to make‐out you two?

332
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,719
No one's making out with anyone!

333
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:28,321
Yeah, right, like anyone'd be
dumb enough to believe that.

334
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,323
You two are
obviously going out.

335
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:31,558
No, we're not!

336
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,126
[AOI]
Then why were you two lovebirds

337
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,595
embracing out in the
dark like that?

338
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:35,929
W‐Well, that's
because...

339
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,731
[AOI] Ugh, now you're
really pissing me off.

340
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,033
You like him, don't
you? Just admit it!

341
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,069
You're wrong! Oh...

342
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:58,652
[MISAKI]
And so, the first day of Maid
Latte's Beach House vacation

343
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:02,656
ended with a night that seemed
a little hotter than usual.

344
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:05,458
[MAN A]
Hot springs sure are nice.

345
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,695
[MAN B]
Yeah, nothin' can beat'em.
(laughing)

346
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,265
Those were just the
extras we didn't use.

347
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,067
Blrgh!

348
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,603
[AOI] Ugh! C'mon, quit it!
[USUI] We're here, so
we might as well go in.

349
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,640
[AOI] I don't wanna go
into the men's bath!

350
00:23:49,963 --> 00:23:53,033
[MISAKI]
So, Usui, did you go into
the hot springs with Aoi?

351
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:55,702
[USUI]
I tried to drag him in but
then he tickled my underarms.

352
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,070
[MISAKI]
Usui, you idiot!

353
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,272
[USUI]
So he got away.
Did you take a bath?

354
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:00,841
[MISAKI]
Only for a bit, thanks to you.

355
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,876
[USUI]
Aah, your spiteful
glare is oh‐so‐nice.

356
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,178
[NAGISA]
Good work, everyone. That
was a fun day off, wasn't it?

357
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,448
[SATSUKI]
You said it, Nagisa. Of
course, we can't go to
sleep yet, can we?

358
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,816
Got anything, Subaru?

359
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:11,652
[SUBARU]
I brought some cards.
And you, Erika?

360
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,486
[ERIKA]
I brought Uno.
What about you, Gon‐chan?

361
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,788
[GON‐CHAN]
A ball game. And you, Sayu?

362
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:16,523
[SAYU]
A collection of poetry! Honoka?

363
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,492
[HONOKA]
I'll tell SCARYYY stories.
