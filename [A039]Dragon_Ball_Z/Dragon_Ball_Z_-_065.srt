00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,625
Vegeta launched
an all-out attack

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,708
against the
brutish Recoome,

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,416
but the Saiyan Prince's
strength was no match

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,000
for the might of
the Ginyu Force...

6
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:31,166
Fortunately, Krillin and Gohan
were standing by at the ready!

7
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,041
But even though
Vegeta was spared

8
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,916
the brunt of
Recoome's blast,

9
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,583
Krillin's counter-attack
had little effect.

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,166
Fool!

11
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Hey! Jeice!
Burter!

12
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,375
Can I kill
this one, too?

13
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,375
[NARRATOR] And then the
unthinkable...

14
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,500
Krillin fell!

15
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:57,250
It's... all right... It's
time to face the facts.

16
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,166
The Dragon Balls
are gone...

17
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,750
[NARRATOR] Now, with Krillin and
Vegeta out of commission,

18
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
only one fighter remains to
challenge the evil Recoome.

19
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,541
You stay away!

20
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,500
I-I'm not gonna let you
hurt my friend any more!

21
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,125
[RECOOME] Let me get
this straight, little man.

22
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,458
You're gonna
stop me?

23
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,458
You think you're 
tough, don't you?

24
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,750
Well, come on then,
let's see what you've got!

28
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,625
[JEICE] Ugh. We should've
kept our turn...

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,958
[BURTER] Aw, let
Recoome have him.

30
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,583
I mean, it hardly
seems worth it now.

31
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,833
This kid won't put up
much of a fight on his own.

32
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,958
Gohan...

00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,750

Not bad...

48
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,416
Yeah! For a second there,

49
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,041
the kid's power went
up over 20,000!

50

Aw, don't
sweat it, kid!

55
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,375
I don't mind gettin'
my hands dirty.

56
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,166
Not when there's
killing involved.

Oh  no... Gohan!

[MRS. BRIEF] ChiChi?
Did you say something?

66
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,833
Is everything
all right, dear?

67
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,833
[ChiChi] I-It's my Gohan...

68
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,958
He's in trouble.
I just know it!

69
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,166
Ahh. Oh...

70
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,291
[ChiChi] He... He's
lost without me...

71
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,791
I have to
do something!

72
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
Don't worry
yourself too much.

73
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,833
I'm sure Gohan is
doing just fine.

74
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,500
After all, he's got my
Bulma to take care of him!

[MRS. BRIEF giggles]

76
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,958
[ChiChi] Dr. Brief!
I need that ship!

77
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,500
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, ChiChi!
Good, you're just in time!

78
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
I was just putting on
the finishing touches!

79
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,541
She's a beauty,
isn't she?

80
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,750
I had all the plans worked
out from the first one,

81
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,583
so putting this one
together was a snap!

82
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:54,750
I even managed to get
the cappuccino maker

83
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,208
installed this ti--

84
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,208
All that's left to do
now is test her out!

85
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,375
[CHICHI] Mommy's coming,
Gohan! Mommy's coming!

86
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,666
Just hold on!
I'm coming!

87
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,708
[DR. BRIEF] ChiChi? Maybe you'd
better let me just show you

88
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,708
how to work the
controls! ChiChi?!

89
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,208
C'mon you
bucket of bolts!

90
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,875
My son's in trouble!
Let's go already!

91
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,541
[DR. BRIEF] No, ChiChi! Wait!
It hasn't been tested yet!

92
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,208
You don't know
what you're doing!

I installed those airbags.

[GINYU] And one
more makes seven.

110
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,083
[FRIEZA] Once again,
you have more than

111
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,958
outdone yourself,
Captain Ginyu.

112
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,750
When I am the ruler
of the Universe,

113
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,250
your efforts will
be repaid tenfold.

114
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,083
I can already
see it now.

115
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,541
Thank you my loyal subject,
for a job well done.

116
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,250
It was my
pleasure, Frieza.

117
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,375
You know how much I enjoy
serving your lordship.

118
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,875
At last, I've
searched so long and

119
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,166
the Dragon Balls
are finally mine.

120
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,208
It's time to
make my wish...

Allow me to honor you

value your life, stop.

Aw, did I hurt your feelings?
I'm so sorry... Get over it!

128
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,083
This is my moment of glory.
Don't spoil it for me.

129
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,458
You're right,
Lord Frieza.

130
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,875
I don't know what
came over me.

131
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,958
You have a
wish to make.

132

The Dance of Joy
can wait!

133
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,958
Now, Dragon Balls...
Grant my wish!

00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,625
[FRIEZA] U-Uhh..
M-My wish...

179
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,416
Maybe it already came
true... I don't know.

180
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,541
Does it feel like you
have eternal life?

181
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:28,083
[FRIEZA] No... At least,
I... I-I don't think so...

182
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:31,458
Nothing's changed...

183
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,166
Why? What's wrong?!

184
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,500
Wait!

185
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
Here, it's yours!
Go ahead and take it!

186
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:41,125
It doesn't matter.
You'll never succeed!

187
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
Even if you do find
all seven balls,

188
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,333
you still won't be able
to make your wish...

189
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,333
[FRIEZA] Before I destroyed
his village and took

190
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,958
the second
Dragon Ball,

191
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,166
one of the elder Nameks
warned me this would happen.

192
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,208
I didn't think much
of it at the time.

193
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,333
People will say anything
when they're about to die.

194
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:01,541
But now it seems the old
geezer was telling the truth!

195
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,083
Urrgh... I can't
make my wish!

196
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,666
There must be some secret
to unlocking their power!

197
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,250
A password! A code!

198
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,666
Some sort of special ritual
to release the dragon

199
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,541
that only Nameks
would know!

200
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,208
I could scream!
Curses!

201
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,000
I have all seven Dragon Balls,
and they're worthless!

202
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,083
Now I need a Namek to
show me how to use them!

203
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,625
Check the Scouter,
Lord Frieza.

204
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,875
There's bound to be
one or two of them left.

205
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,708
[FRIEZA growls]

206
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,833
[FRIEZA] Hmmm...

207
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,958
[FRIEZA] The rest of the Ginyu
Force is in that direction.

208
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,041
Perhaps Vegeta or
his new friends

209
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,916
can tell us what
we need to know.

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,416
Uhh?! It's best not to stop
the men once they get started.

211
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,958
I'm sure if we
keep looking...

212
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,916
Oh... Hey,
there we go!

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,791
There's still a small band
of Nameks in quadrant three.

214
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,875
You see? There's two of
them, due north.

215
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,916
And the third is
approaching from the East.

216
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,833
Somehow, they've managed to
avoid detection until now.

217
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,291
As usual, my men weren't
nearly as thorough

218
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,333
as they should have been
while searching the planet...

219
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,458
Normally, I'd be angry,
but in this case,

220
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,791
their incompetence has turned
out to be rather fortunate,

221
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,291
wouldn't you say?

222
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,541
Lord Frieza, just
give me one hour

223
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,708
and I'll find out
everything you need to know

224
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,000
about the
Dragon Balls!

225
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,750
I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

226
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,416
But I prefer to
handle this myself.

227
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,291
I've dealt with
enough Nameks now

228
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,375
that I know exactly
what buttons to push

229
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,458
to make them spill
their secrets...

230
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,916
You stay here,
Captain Ginyu.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,625
I'm counting on you to
keep my Dragon Balls safe!

232
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,666
Right! You can
count on me, Lord!

233
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,541
I'll guard
them with my life!

234
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:49,833
Ha! Ready or not,
Nameks... Here I come!

235
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:57,958
[GOHAN grunting]

236
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:03,500
[panting]

237
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,625
Gohan...

238
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:08,750
[GOHAN] I have to
keep trying...

239
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:14,541
For Piccolo... For Yamcha...
Tien... Chiaotzu...

240
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,166
They're all
counting on me...

241
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,291
[RECOOME chuckles]

242
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,333
And I am not going
to let them down!

243
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,500
[GOHAN shouts]

244
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:29,083
[RECOOME] Ha, ha!
You missed me!

245
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,916
[GOHAN growls]

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,250
Now!
It's my tuuurn!

247
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,166
Recoooome
Bomber!

248
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,791
[RECOOME yelling]

249
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,250
[GOHAN shouts]

250
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,625
[RECCOME yelling]

251
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,916
[GOHAN shouts]

252
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,833
[RECOOME yelling]

253
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:09,250
[RECOOME laughing]

254
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,666
[GOHAN screams]

255
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
Yoo-hoo!

256
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,458
[GOHAN grunts]

257
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,416
[screaming]

258
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,958
[GOHAN grunting]

259
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,708
[RECOOME] Hmmm...

260
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,333
Well, now...
Still alive, huh?

261
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,166
That's... enough...
Gohan... stop...

262
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,250
[GOHAN coughs]

263
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:29,041
[GOHAN grunting]

264
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:48,708
[GOHAN] No... It's
not over yet...

265
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:53,750
I... won't... quit...

266
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,208
[GOHAN] Dad wouldn't give
up. Neither will I.

267
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,250
Well... Who's
the big man, huh?

268
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,583
Really, kid...

269
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,833
I've fought some stubborn
characters in my day...

270
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,166
But you...
You take the cake.

271
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:14,875
Now! Let Recoome
show you your doom!

272
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:20,125
Never! I'm not
gonna let you win!

273
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:24,250
[GOHAN screaming]

274
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:25,791
[KRILLIN gasps]

275
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,458
[grunting]

276
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:38,208
[RECOOME laughing]

277
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,750
[KRILLIN gasps]

278
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,500
[RECOOME] Hmph.

279
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,708
Haah.

280
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,791
[RECOOME laughs]

281
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,333
Gohan, no!

282
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:18,666
[KRILLIN whimpers]

283
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:24,833
[JEICE chuckles]

284
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,833
Well, that's the
end of that.

285
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,041
I don't think that kid's
getting up this time.

286
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:33,125
How could he? Recoome
just snapped his neck!

287
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:37,708
[KRILLIN crying]

288
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:41,416
Bah! That little runt
was our last hope...

289
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,208
Damn! I should've known better
than to rely on a child!

290
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,000
[ChiChi] Gohan...?

291
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,583
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, good.
She's waking up!

292
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,333
[MRS. BRIEF] ChiChi, you
gave us such a scare!

293
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,583
Something's happened...
Oh, Gohan!

294
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:12,166
[CHICHI sobs]

295
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,541
[JEICE] Oy! Recoome!

296
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,125
Huh? What?!

297
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,791
[JEICE] Finish up your handiwork
so we can report back to Frieza!

298
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,875
[BURTER] Yeah, we don't
want to spend all day

299
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,416
watching you
have fun!

300
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,291
Let's get this
over with!

301
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,833
Hold your horses, this
will just take a second!

302
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,375
[BOTH gasp]

303
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,666
[JEICE] Wonder
who that is?

304
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,458
[BURTER] We're not
expecting anybody...

305
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,541
Maybe some Nameks
coming home from vacation?

306
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,708
[JEICE] Poor dopes!
They have no idea

307
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,041
what they're getting
themselves into!

308
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:19,708
[computer beeping]

309
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,000
[GOKU] It's time...

310
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:37,250
[NARRATOR] At long last, Goku
has arrived on Planet Namek!

311
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,666
And after his extensive
training in 100-times gravity,

312
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,833
he's ready to face
the challenges ahead.

313
00:22:43,916 --> 00:22:46,041
But even with all of
his awesome strength,

314
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,125
will he be able to
save his friends?

315
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,333
Or is he already
too late?

316
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:55,375
Find out, in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
