00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,416
an evil android creature
arrived from the future

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
to take over the world.

5
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,500
And mankind seems
powerless to stop it.

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,000
[COUPLE screams]

7
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,333
[NARRATOR] Fortunately,
Goku has fully recovered

8
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:31,041
from the devastating virus that
had a grip on him for so long.

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,916
And now he's ready to
put his plan into action.

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,291
[NARRATOR] Goku has to
get into fighting shape,

11
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:41,083
and he's taking Vegeta, Trunks,
and Gohan to Kami's place

12
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,916
where they can get a year of
intense training in one day.

13
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,208
[VEGETA] All right, I'll go!

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,666
[NARRATOR]
The door is open,

15
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,125
all they have to do
is step through...

16
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,333
[MR. POPO] Good luck.

17
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,416
[NARRATOR] Is Trunks
tough enough to survive

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541
being locked in a
room with Vegeta?

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,458
If Goku is right,
this training will push

20
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:01,333
all of their Saiyan powers
to the next level,

21
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:05,500
transforming them
into Ascended Saiyans.

22
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,166
This plan had better work,
because those three

23
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,833
devious androids are
still hot on his trail.

24
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,541
[ANDROID 17] Hi...
Can Goku come out and play?

25
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,000
Where has Goku gone?

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,958
If you don't tell us
where he's hiding,

27
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,875
I'll make you tell us.

28
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,541
Alright... Have it your way.

29
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,375
Over there! That island!
You and me!

30
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,916
Very well...
If you really want to.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,125
[NARRATOR] Piccolo's definitely
got his hands full now.

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:37,416
Locked into a deadly
duel with Android 17.

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,333
Since uniting with Kami,

34
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,458
Piccolo has been pumped up
with extra power.

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:47,166
But does he have the strength to
pull the plug on Android 17?

36
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,333
Find out today!

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,208
Tell us where Goku is...
or I'll make you.

38
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,083
Last chance.

39
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,875
[PICCOLO] I'm going
to enjoy this.

40
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,333
[ANDROID 17] Hm...

41
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,708
[ANDROID 17] Hm.
I don't think you know

42
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:08,666
what you're getting into
by challenging me.

43
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,291
Just give up.

44
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:16,041
Really.
You can't win.

47
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,708
[ANDROID 17] Very well.
Let's see what you've got.

48
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,958
[PICCOLO gasps]

49
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,416
[thinking] Fighting this android
is going to be tough because

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,375
I won't be able to keep
an eye on the other two.

51
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,625
I've got to make sure
they won't attack me

52
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,375
--while my back is turned.
--[ANDROID 18 chuckles]

53
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:45,583
Keep those two
out of this. Alright?

54
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,125
[ANDROID 17]
Don't worry.

55
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:52,416
Those two are only spectators.
This is between me and you.

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,666
[thinking] Perfect!

57
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,250
If it's just him, then
I won't have any problem

58
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,833
shutting him down.

59
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,541
I'll take out Android 17 first
and then I'll get the others.

60
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,583
If I can beat them, then Cell
will have nothing to absorb

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,500
and he won't be able
to become complete.

I've never felt anything
like this before.

74
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,250
The energy coming from
Piccolo is incredible!

00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,208
Wow!

00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,000
It's for real?

But, he's all
alone out there?

No, Kami is with
Piccolo right now!

That's no ordinary
energy level.

81
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,958
It's the combined powers of Kami
and Piccolo working together.

fighting, Daddy?

87

Is it Cell?

There's no life force...

You're just not
strong enough yet!

And besides, you'd only
get in Piccolo's way!

As soon as we
finish our training,

we'll go down and help Piccolo.
You can count on it!

Yes. That's right.

00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,958
I wish...
I could cry.

181
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:12,833
Heh. Nice shooting.
But not quite nice enough.

182
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,083
[PICCOLO] Hmph.

199
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,500
What? He deflected my blast!

200
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,583
Well done.
Impressive light show.

201
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,708
Do you have anymore
tricks to share with me

202
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,250
before I finish you?

203
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,000
[ANDROID 18] 17 is
playing with him.

204
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:07,000
Why doesn't he just get it over
with? Then we can go find Goku!

205

[PICCOLO yells]

207
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:25,083
It feels like a fierce
battle is going on,

208
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,583
but I can't tell who's winning,

209
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:29,458
Is it Piccolo or the android?

210
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,875
I know who's going to win!

211
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,541
There's no way that Android
could have as much power

212
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,000
as Piccolo right now.

213
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,208
[ROSHI] Not so fast!

214
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,625
Piccolo's energy
is incredible, yes,

215
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,708
but we really don't know
how strong the Android is!

216
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,708
For all we know, that Android
is as strong as ten Piccolos.

217
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,791
[ANDROID 17] What a shame.

218
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,375
Is that all you've got for me?

219
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,500
No!

220
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:09,000
Come on... Let's go!
Finish him off.

221
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,625
If you can't
do it then maybe

222
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,500
you should let someone
who can--like me!

223
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,750
Stay out of this.

224
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,750
Can't you see I'm just
trying to have some fun?

225
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,083
Are you ready to begin again?

226
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,750
Yes, of course.

227
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,458
I have enjoyed
this game.

228
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:31,875
I'd love to stay, but I must
find Goku and deal with him.

229
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,416
[PICCOLO] Then stop talking
and start fighting!

00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,833
[ANDROID 17] Again?

235
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,375

What a fool.

240
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,375

he'll get lucky and hit me.

What have you done?!

247
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
[ANDROID 17] He was
never trying to hit me!

248
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,708
It was a trick all along!

[PICCOLO] You never expected a
guidance scatter shot, did ya?

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,041
It's all over.
There's no escape for you now!

of terror ends today!

over 'til it's over!

Meet me there and we'll
end this little game

will be spared...

things to deal with right now!

Hmm... Ah yes, perfect...

278
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,041
Piccolo must be
fighting Android 17!

taken a turn for the worse.

Cell is on his way to
absorb the androids,

289
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:15,416
but Piccolo is completely
unaware of the imminent danger.

290
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,166
There's no room for error!

291
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,083
[NARRATOR] Piccolo put up a good
fight against Android 17.

292
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:26,041
But even with the power of
Kami surging through him,

293
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,333
he couldn't recycle
that renegade robot!

294
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,375
Now more than ever, the help
of Goku and the other Saiyans

295
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:35,875
is needed to stop these
machines of madness!

296
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,750
With every second that ticks by,
Cell is closing in!

297
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,416
If he gets to the island
before Goku and Gohan

298
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,791
can finish their training,
then all hope is lost!

299
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,208
Could this be the
beginning of the end?
