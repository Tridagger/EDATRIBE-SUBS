00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,083
as the first competitor
in the Cell Game,

4
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:17,916
Goku came out swinging,

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,666
but everything he threw at
the slippery serpent Cell,

6
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,041
including the Kamehameha Wave
attack, had no effect. 

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,333
And, a behind the
back sneak attack

8
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,250
only made Cell more psychotic.

9
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,125
So much so that he nearly
polished the Super Saiyan off

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,625

power-packed punches.

13

and determined to beat
the beast in battle,

14
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,000
Goku carefully planned
his next attack.

15
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,291
But Cell's uncanny ability

16
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,416
to anticipate every one
of his moves

17
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,250
stifled any chance
of a strategy.

18
00:02:56,333 --> 00:03:00,083

just their warm up?

gonna fight for real.

20
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,500
[NARRATOR] While a world wide

21
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,791
the two warriors
stood their ground,

22
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,750
stone faced and silent.

23
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:15,083
Making it impossible to know
what was really on their minds.

24
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,958
[NARRATOR] Now its time for Goku
to pull out all the stops.

25
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,458
He's got to use his
Super Saiyan powers

26

of terror Cell.

They both posses
incredible power,

28
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,125

brains, as well as brawn,

00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,875
to win this competition.

30
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,041
Cell's passion for
inflicting pain

31
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,291
makes him a fiercesome
force to fight against.

32
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,041
And, to him, defeating Goku
would be the ultimate prize.

33

When these two
clash again

34
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,125
only one of them
will be left standing.

Well, thanks. I try.

He did it!

[ANNOUNCER] What an upset!

197
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,625
Cell is down and out and it
looks like it might be for good!

198
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,166
We could have a new champion!

Goku has beat Cell!

201
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,166
That means that
he won the tournament!

[VEGETA] Ha... I doubt it!

203
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,208
Can't you see that's exactly
what Cell wants you to think?!

204
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,750
He's playing another one of
his tricks on you, that's all!

If you weren't
so busy celebrating,

you would notice that Cell's

[KING KAI] No,
that's not Krillin's move!

216

That's the last technique
Frieza used against Goku!

217
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,708
And if Cell feels he cannot win,

218
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,750
he may destroy Earth just as
Frieza destroyed planet Namek!

an evil monster on planet Earth?

possibly escaped!

have flown up and diverted it.
