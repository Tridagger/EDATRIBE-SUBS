1
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,916
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,625
Time ran out
for our heroes,

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,166
as Frieza's diabolical
Ginyu Force

4
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,708
descended from
the skies!

5
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:24,708
Even the mighty Vegeta
could only watch helplessly,

6
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,666
as his hopes for using the
seven magic Dragon Balls

7
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,458
to make a wish
vanished into thin air!

8
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,541
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN whimper]

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,791
Now then, if
you'll excuse me,

10
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:40,625
I have to deliver these
Dragon Balls to Lord Frieza.

11
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,291
[ALL] We are
the Ginyu Force!

12
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,416
[ALL laugh]

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] Captain Ginyu made a
hasty departure with his prize,

14
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,875
but he left behind
his four lieutenants,

15
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:55,833
with orders to eradicate
Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta...

16
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,666
Now, these unlikely allies
must stand together

17
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,291
if they hope to survive
the battle ahead...

18
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,916
Say there...
Why don't you go ahead

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,125
and take your
turn first, Guldo.

20
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,916
Yeah, why don't I?

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,291
[NARRATOR] Gohan and Krillin
fight for their lives... today!

22
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,000
Whoa! Yeah, just
look at 'em go! Ha!

23
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,333
Lotta good
that's gonna do.

24
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:46,791
Now!

25
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,250
Right!

26
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,250
[BOTH] Haaa!

27
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,583
Buh! 'Kay...

28
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,500
[GULDO screams]

29
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,625
Time Freeze!

30
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,875
[thinking] Ha! Suckers.

31
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,875
[thinking] What?! They're gone!

32
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,541
Why, those little... Try to
sneak up on me, will ya'?

33
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,875
Well, it's not
gonna work!

34
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,625
[thinking] Hey! They're
some quick little buggers,

35
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,916
aren't they? Oh well...
Now I got 'em...

36
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,500
[thinking] Uh-oh...
There's just one problem!

37
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:34,041
I... can't... hold my...
breath... any longer!

38
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,250
[GOHAN yells]

39
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,583
[GULDO panting]

40
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,291
Have to admit
I'm impressed...

41
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,791
Guess those two are
tougher than we thought!

42
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:56,166
Oohh...

43
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,541
Now isn't
that something...

44
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,708
Looks like our little
friends have the ability

45
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,875
to increase their power
without changing their shape!

46
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,375
[JEICE] Hey, Vegeta! You got
some real choice mates there!

47
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:08,708
Incredible...

48
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,250
Their speed and power have
increased exponentially

49
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:13,083
since I fought
them on Earth.

50
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,208
That was
amazing, Gohan!

51
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,083
If I hadn't seen it, I'd never
believed you had it in you!

52
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,666
Yeah, that makes
two of us!

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,375
But thanks to Guru,
I've never felt stronger!

54
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,958
But look! How'd he get
way over there already?

55
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,833
I dunno. Maybe he stopped
time again... Be careful!

56
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,333
[GOHAN] Right!

57
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,083
[GULDO] Yah! Not again!

58
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,458
Uh? Huh?! Ah-ah-ah!

59
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,833
Time Freeze!

60
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:04,791
[GULDO squeals]

61
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:12,083
[thinking] Wait a second!
Why am I running away?

62
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,666
They're the ones who are
supposed to be scared of me!

63
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,583
Heh! Prepare to
die, small fry!

64
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,250
[GULDO growling]

65
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,416
[coughs]

66
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,291
[BOTH gasp]

67
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,791
Ugh... Oh, crud!

68
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,583
There he is!

69
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:40,250
Ka-me-ha-me-HAAA!

70
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,000
[GULDO screams]

71
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,250
[GOHAN growling]

72
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,208
Haaa!

73
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,750

74
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,208
[coughing, gruntiing]

75
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:50,291
I guess old four-eyes
didn't see that one comin'!

76
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,583
If I were a betting man,
I'd say Guldo's gonna lose.

77
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:54,791
Oh, obvious.

78
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,541
Thanks for pointing out
the obvious, Burter.

79
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,833
Guldo'll kill 'em
in under a minute!

80
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:02,166
One chocolate nut
bar says he does!

81
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,791
Ha! You're on!

82
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,541
[GULDO panting]

83
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,791
Knew I should have joined that
Ginyu Fitness Club last year,

84
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,083
but no, I had to go on that
stupid chiliburger diet!

85
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,000
[BULMA] Come on...

86
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:25,500
Come in, Master
Roshi, this is Bulma!

87
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,833
I need your help!

88
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,708
Krillin and Gohan have
run off and left me again!

89
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:31,166
And they've taken our
Dragon Ball with them!

90
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,291
What's worse:
They're with Vegeta!

91
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,833
[ROSHI] What? Vegeta?
My, that does sound serious.

92
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,791
But I'm sure they have their
reasons. You just sit tight.

93
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,416
They'll be back
before you know it.

94
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,708
[BULMA] I'm tired of sitting
tight! I can't take it anymore!

95
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,875
I just wanna get off
this stupid planet!

96
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:50,000
Ah, well, I certainly
do feel your pain...

97
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,833
But there's really
not much you can do

98
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:55,333
with your spaceship blown
to pieces, now is there?

99
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:58,541
I wish there was something
I could say to help...

100
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,500
Oh, wait! Hasn't it been
six days since Goku left?

101
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,875
He should be getting
there any minute now!

102
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,166
He'll get'cha home!

103
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,541
[BULMA] What?! The
signal's breaking up!

104
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:12,833
Hello? Ugh...
Mmm... Agh!

105
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,333
Master Roshi?!
Ooohh! Darn it!

106
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,208
This stupid
satellite phone!

107
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,291
I hate using
outdated technology!

108
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,250
[thinking] Goku, please
hurry. We need you!

[GULDO panting]

110
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,666
Hey, Gohan! Looks like
all this time-stopping's

111
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,458
starting to
wear him down.

112
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,291
Now, let's end this before
he gets his strength back!

113
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,500
Gotcha!

114
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,875
[KRILLIN] Okay, ready?
On my mark... NOW!

[thinking] Aw, hell! Of all
the times to run outta energy!

120
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, there's only
one thing left to do...

121
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,958
[thinking] And that's
to run for it!

122
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,833
[thinking] I gotta find
me a place to hide!

123
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,458
[ thinking] There! I can
hide behind that rock

124

'til I catch my breath!

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,541
[KRILLIN] He did it again!

127
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,333
[KRILLIN] C'mon!
We gotta find him!

128
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,041
[KRILLIN] You sense
anything, Gohan?

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,375
Behind that ridge!

C'mon, Guldo, you're
killin' me here!

138
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,541
I dunno, I'm kind of
enjoying watching him

139
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,208
get his flabby
tail whipped!

140
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,666
Hey, Guldo!
Here's the deal:

141
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,458
If you can't beat those two
little punks, and I mean quick,

142
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,458
then you're outta
the Ginyu Force!

143
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,166
Yeah, and not to mention your
spot on the bowling team!

145
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:22,791
But, you can't kick
me off the force!

I was just warming
up! That's all!

I promise!

Charge him, full power!

Right!

150
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,083
What do I do?

151
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,416
It's time to pull
out all the stops!

that trick?

Looks like what we said really
lit a fire under old Guldo.

170
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,041
He never uses
his "mind bind".

171

Not unless he's
gettin' desperate.

172

Yeah, it's a shame
didn't use it sooner.

00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,208
It's been more than a
minute. You lose the bet.

176
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,041
Ugh. Yeah,
yeah, whatever...

177
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,833
Here's your stupid
chocolate bar.

178

180
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,750
Dammit...
Those ignorant fools.

181
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,833
I specifically warned them
not to try a direct assault!

182
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,000
They flew right
into Guldo's trap!

183
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,875
Ha! Get ready, boys!

184
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,583
I'm gonna finish you
off nice and slow!

185
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,416
Raaa...

186
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,625
Haah!

187
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,625
[shouting continues]

188
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,166

191
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,541
Hey, Guldo!
Just kill 'em!

192
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,666
Yeah, step on it!

193
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,250
C'mon, we don't
have all day!

197
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,833
[GULDO] Whee!

198
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:36,041
Little baby not so tough
after all! Guchi guchi goo.

199
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,833
[GULDO laughing]

200
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:39,916
[GULDO] Come on!

201
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,375
[laughing continues]

202
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,666
What's wrong? You don't like
me pulling on your cheeks?

203
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,458
So how 'bout I try
pounding instead?!

Gohan!

207
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,583
[GULDO] Take that, and that!
And one to grow on!

[GULDO chuckles]

209
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,541
Oh, hey there, Cueball. Don't
think I've forgotten about you!

00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,458
[RECOOME] That's enough goofin'
around! Get on with it already!

216
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,250
[JEICE] Do I have to come up
there and kill 'em for you?!

217
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,708
[BURTER] It's still not too late
to kick you off the force!

218
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:42,708
Uh, uh, right! Huh, huh?

219
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,041
A-ha!

do the trick!

[GULDO laughs]

229
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,125
Personally, I prefer
mine well done!

[BOTH grunting]

231
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,083

Uh-oh! Heh, heh, heh. Almost
there! Time's running out, boys!

235
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,666
Last chance to save yourselves
before I stick it to ya'!

[grunting]

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,958
No! I have to...
break free!

238
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,833
I can't
disappoint Piccolo!

[thinking] Gohan's
in trouble!

243
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,166
[thinking] So, Piccolo, you can
also sense the trouble on Namek.

244
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,000
I know how badly you must
want to help your friends,

245
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:26,375
but from here I'm
afraid there's nothing

246
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,625
we can do
for them!

247

Oh?

[YAMCHA] Piccolo...?

252
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,666
Now that's what I'd
call breaking wind!

253
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,666
Heh, heh, heh! Get it?

[GULDO laughs]

257
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,375
Now, let's see here!
Who dies first?

258
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,375
Bah. Sorry, baldy. That
big shiny head of yours

259
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,291
just gave
you away..

260
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,166
It's way too easy a
target to pass up!

261
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,958
[KRILLIN whimpers]

263
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,708
Gohan, forget about me!
Save yourself!

264
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:38,083
It's no use! I still
can't move a muscle!

265
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,333
[GULDO laughs]

266
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,958
Ready or not...
Time to die!

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,333
[GULDO laughs]

268
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,791
[GULDO] Huh?!

269
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:58,708
Krillin!

270
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,166
Gohan!

[GULDO whimpering]

275
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,333
No... No...
Fair, Vegeta.

276
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,875
You cheated!

277
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,541
This fight was
supposed to be

278
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,166
just me against those
two! Alone, Vegeta!

279
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,375
There's no such thing as
fair or unfair in battle...

280
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,375
There is only victory.
Or, in your case, defeat.

281
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,291
[GULDO] You...
You dirty Saiyan!

282
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,250
Do you really think
you'll get away with this?

283
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,625
You're nothing!
Just a stupid monkey!

284
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,583
I belong to
the Ginyu Force!

285
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,458
[VEGETA chuckles]

286
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,125
[VEGETA] Not anymore.

287
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,583
[GULDO screams]

288
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,708
Well, I certainly didn't expect
you'd be the one to help us.

289
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,083
Thank you.

290
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,958
[VEGETA] Keep your thanks...

291
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,541
I had my own reasons for
wanting to destroy that freak.

292
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,541
[BOTH gasp]

293
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,916
I saw my moment to
strike, and I acted on it.

294
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,166
That's all. It had nothing to
do with saving your lives.

295
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,833
From now on, you'd
best watch yourselves.

296
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,875
Because next time...
you won't be so lucky.

297
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:35,375
That's insane! The crazy
bastard actually killed Guldo!

298
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,666
Yeah...
We're in trouble!

299
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,541
I know!
With Guldo gone,

300
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,125
our whole
routine is ruined!

301
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,833
We're gonna have to
come up with a new one!

302
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,458
[ALL] Hmm...

303
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,333
Recoome!

304
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,583
Burter!

305
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,166
Jeice!

306
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,333
Now!

307
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:03,291
[ALL] Feel the power
of the Ginyu Force!

308
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,958
[RECOOME] Uh, do any of
you guys feel not so fresh?

309
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,250
I'd say Captain Ginyu's
gonna be pissed!

310
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,750
You guys know
how he gets.

311
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,875
He worked real hard on
that choreography...

312
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,125
[JEICE] That's right!

313
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,416
And someone's gotta pay
for it means one of us

314
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,291
has got to teach
these twerps a lesson!

315
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,500
[RECOOME] I still
got dibs on Vegeta.

316
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,833
[BURTER] Then it's
between me and you

317
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,208
for the other two, Jeice!

318
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,416
[JEICE} Let's do it!

319
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
And, go!

320
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:35,041
[BURTER &amp; JEICE] Rock, paper,
scissors! Rock, paper, scissors!

321
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:44,625
[chanting continues]

322
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,708
Who knows?
Maybe we'll get lucky

323
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,625
and they'll keep
tying forever.

324
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,458
Well, maybe. I guess it
doesn't hurt to have hope.

325
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,000
[BOTH] Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors!

326
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:57,166

[VEGETA growls]

328
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,958
No... Hope is a luxury
none of us can afford.

329
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,375
[NARRATOR] After his long and
perilous journey through space,

330
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:20,875
Goku is now in the final
approach to Planet Namek.

331
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,166
But, even after all of his
training at 100-times gravity,

332
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,958
is he prepared to face
the evil might of Frieza,

333
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,166
the most powerful villain
the galaxy has ever known?

334
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,916
And more importantly,
will he be able to put a stop

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,458
to the remaining members
of the Ginyu force-

336
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,458
Burter, Jeice, Recoome,
and Captain Ginyu himself-

337
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:43,333
before they put a permanent
end to all of his friends?

338
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:50,000
[NARRATOR] A showdown of epic
proportions is about to begin...

339
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,875
and it all starts in the
next exciting episode

340
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:55,333
of Dragon Ball Z!
