00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,291
Spopovitch and Yamu attacked,
armed with a mysterious device

4
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,208
that drained Gohan
of his energy.

5
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,458
[SPOPOVICH laughs]

6
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:26,125
Hey, that was
easier than we thought.

7
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,208
[NARRATOR] Shin, now revealed
to be the Supreme Kai himself,

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,791
flew from the arena in pursuit
of Gohan's assailants.

9
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,291
The Z-Fighters also
took to the skies,

10
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,916
where they learned
the true nature

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
of the danger they
rushed to face...

12
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,625
[SUPREME KAI] I'm glad
you decided to come.

13
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:42,166
And thank you.

14
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,166
Without all of your help I would
not be able to defeat them!

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,750
You need us...
to beat those two?

16
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,500
No, it's not Spopovitch and
Yamu that concern me...

17
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,583
It's the wizard
that controls them!

18
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,416

Back on the stadium floor,

19
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,708

restore Gohan's energy...

20
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,083
Gohan may be back
in fighting shape,

21
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,708
but will he be ready to meet
a powerful new enemy?

22
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,916
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

23
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,750
We did it!

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,625
Once we give him
this pure energy,

25
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,000
Babidi should be very pleased...

to be great.

28
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,041
Yeah.

Hmm...

[SUPREME KAI]
There...

39
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,750
That's it, drones,
lead the way.

40
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,333
So, it's obvious
you were able

41
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:10,083
to defeat
this wizard Bibidi

42
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,708
before he could unleash
Majin Buu on the Earth.

43
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,791
But you didn't
destroy Majin Buu.

44
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:18,166
You chose instead to leave him
here, lying dormant.

45
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,000
That's right...

46
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,916
We thought it best that way.

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,333
We believed that Bibidi
was the only one

48
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,083
who could free Majin Buu...

49
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,541
We were mistaken in that belief.

50
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,291
Bibidi has a son--
also a wizard.

51
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,625
And if he isn't stopped,
Majin Buu will live again.

52
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,250
So I guess Bibidi's son is
controlling the guys

53
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,708
from the tournament?

54
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,666
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes. His name is Babidi.

55
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,958
And as is often the case
in this universe,

56
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,000
the son is as evil
as the father.

57
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,375
[KRILLIN] Great.
Why does that not surprise me?

58
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,041
It's simple. All we have
to do is stop Babidi

59
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,333
from waking up Majin Buu, right?

60
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,916
Yes, that's right...

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,541
But I'm afraid that it won't be
as easy as you make it sound...

62
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,041
Babidi's abilities as a wizard
are not to be underestimated.

63
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,583
It may take all of us
to defeat him.

64
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,791
[GOKU]
Wow...

65
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,958
It sounds like this
guy's pretty strong...

66
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,208
Babidi's strength
lies in his magic.

67
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,625
Physically, he is
not very powerful...

68
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,166
Nor was his father.

69
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,541
But a wizard does
not need to be...

70
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,125
Instead, his magic enables
him to harness the evil

71
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,166
that exists in the hearts of
people like Yamu and Spopovitch,

72
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,833
and thereby control
their actions.

73
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:28,166
Imagine what would happen

74
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,250
if someone truly powerful
came under his spell...

75
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,166
[GOHAN]
If Yamu and Spopovich

76
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,750
didn't enter the
tournament to win,

77
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,291
then why were they even there?

78
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,250
I mean, what did they do to me?

79
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:58,000
Babidi intends to
resurrect Majin Buu,

80
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,333
but before he can do this,

81
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:03,041
he requires a tremendous
amount of pure energy.

82
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,000
So they came after me?

83
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,791
Babidi sent them
to the tournament

84
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,500
because he believed that it
would be the easiest place

85
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,041
to gather such a large
amount of energy...

86
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,375
Only after they saw you
transform into a Super Saiyan

87
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,666
did you become their target.

88
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,750
The Supreme Kai
and myself knew

89
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,375
that Babidi would send
someone to the tournament.

90
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,416
We also entered.

91
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,083
The ball containing
Majin Buu has vanished...

92
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,750
We journeyed to where it laid
before, but found no sign of it.

93
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,958
So we believe it is
in Babidi's grasp,

94
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,458
and he waits only for
the energy to open it...

95
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,458
And upon his success...

96
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,541
...the world will
slip into darkness

97
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,500
the like of which has never
been viewed by human eyes.

98
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,625

99
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,458
[GOHAN]
You okay?

100

Yeah...
I'm... I'm fine.

101
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,458
I don't think
I understand.

102
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
I mean, you had your chance
to finish off Majin Buu

103
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
when you were fighting
Babidi's father.

104
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,041
Why didn't you take it?

105
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,500
It wasn't worth
the risk...

106
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,041
We feared that any
external stimulus

107
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,875
might accidentally
set him free...

108
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,000
The ball in which
Majin Buu was confined

109
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,416
was hidden deep
within the earth,

110
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,833
where no human
could ever find it.

111
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,958
So we allowed him
to lie dormant.

112
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,250
If our actions had
caused him to be released,

113
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,708
we would have been
powerless to stop him...

could be some magic trick.

I doubt it, she's
never flown before.

that didn't look like a trick.

Then... My father wasn't the
one who beat Cell, was he?

No, it was you.

Yes... It was.

feeling about that.

It just seemed strange
to me that my father

was capable of that
kind of strength...

been disturbed recently,

dug up or something.

It's so obvious now!

232

That's why we couldn't
find his spaceship

234

He buried the whole
thing underground!

235

And that means...

236
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,291
There's a chance Babidi has
learned that Kibito and I

have followed him here to Earth.

He is the King of

Wait a second.
What is this Demon World?

It is a shadow world that exists
on the other side of this one...

Dabura is the strongest by far.

Yes, it is...

278
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,166
And he is the most
dangerous of them all.

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,750
Remember, it is not his size you
must concern yourself with.

280
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,916
It's his magic.

281
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,666
If he is able to keep a being

282
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,708
such as Dabura
under his control...

283
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:29,291
Just imagine the horror
he could inflict on this world.

284
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,958
So if this Dabura is that
strong and Babidi has him,

285
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:35,958
what's going to keep us from
falling under his spell?

286
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,541
A wizard seeks out the evil
desires in a person's heart.

287
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,041
Once discovered, he manipulates
them, enhances them...

288
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,166
And ultimately uses
them to control.

289
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,125
This is how Dabura was captured.

290
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:50,625
Once Babidi infiltrates
a person's heart,

his influence is complete.

292
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,916
All he needs is to find
but a trace of evil

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,041
to bring someone
under his power.

294

Only those pure of heart
and free of evil desires,
