[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,750
the evil Frieza had Gohan
in the palm of his hand.

3
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,875
But Krillin wasn't about
to take this lying down.

4
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:26,291
Cutting off Frieza's tail
with his Destructo Disk attack,

5
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,250
Krillin escaped using
the Solar Flare technique.

6
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,583
[NARRATOR] Even so,
as the Earthlings gathered

7
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,833
to launch their assult
against Frieza,

8
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,750
their odds didn't look good.

9
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,083
[NARRATOR] Will Gohan and
his gang's combined power

10
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,875
be enough to topple
the tyrannical Frieza?

11
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:50,083
Or can Piccolo's new persona
take Frieza on all by himself?

12
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,541
Find out Frieza's fate today!

13
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,791
Stand back, kid. I'll
take care of him myself.

14
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,250
What?!

15
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,875
No way! I know he's strong,

16
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,208
but I'm just not sure he can
really do it all by himself!

17
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,666
[thinking] Piccolo?

18
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:49,000
I can sense Piccolo's power has
increased since he's left here.

19
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,291
I wonder how that
happened to him?

20
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,000
Wait a second. Are
you saying you think

21
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,375
he's strong enough now to
actually defeat Frieza?

22
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:57,958
[KING KAI] No!

23
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm just saying that for some
strange reason he's stronger,

24
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,750
but he's still no
match for Frieza.

25
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:07,291
If Piccolo fails then we'll
have to remain here forever.

26
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,000
I knew he'd botch this up!

27
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,000
If only I were there,
I'd take Frieza out myself.

28
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,916
[YAMCHA growls]

29
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,625
Yamcha, have a little
more faith in Piccolo.

30
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,875
He'll come through for us...

31
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,791
I just hope you're
right about that!

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,458
Call me crazy, but I
got a funny feeling

33
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,041
that Piccolo doesn't have a
clue what he's up against.

34
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,875
Someone should tell HIM that.

35
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,708
I can't put my finger on it,

36
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,375
but I sense something
different about Piccolo.

37
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,291
What the heck are you
talking about, Gohan?

38
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,250
The Piccolo I know
would never fight

39
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,625
unless he felt for
sure he could win.

40
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,583
You think he has a chance?

41
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,083
Would you two cut the crap?!

42
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,791
There's nothing different
about your stupid green friend

43
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,375
and there's no way he can
win against Frieza, alright?!

44
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,708
B-Bu.. But Piccolo
said that...

45
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:32,083
[thinking] Piccolo is back! And
his power is stronger than ever!

46
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,750
I just hope he's strong enough.

47
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,375
This is just too weird!

48
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,541
I can't seem to put my
finger on what it is

49
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,875
but there's something about
Piccolo that reminds me of Nail.

50
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,291
Hmph.

51
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,291
So you think you're
pretty tough, huh?

52
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,916
Well, it won't take me long to
have you face first in the dirt

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,458
begging for mercy!

54
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,500
Give it a try.

Huh?!

60
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:14,750
Piccolo won!

61
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,166
I can't believe my eyes!

62
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,041
[thinking] Oh, these
idiots actually believe

63
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,458
Frieza's finished.

64
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:24,250
Well, I'm no fool! He'll
be back! Mark my words.

[FRIEZA] Well, who's next?

74
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,541
Or should I just come down
and pick one of you at random?

75
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,208
Ahh! He's alive!

76
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,208
You surprise me, my friend.

77
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:03,458
I thought our time together
had come to an end.

Excuse me, Vegeta,

85
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,791
but I really hate it
when someone leaves

86
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
and doesn't say goodbye.

87
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,041

[FRIEZA] You are quite
the comedian, Vegeta.

91
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,125
If only the rest of
your Saiyan people

92
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:05,958
were around to see the brave
Prince Vegeta now, huh? But...

93

[FRIEZA laughs]

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,625
That really doesn't matter

95
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:13,166
because I've got you cornered
like a frightened little mouse!

96
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,666
Oh, don't worry, dear Prince.

97
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,875
I'm going to save you until

98
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,791
I've taken care of your

for the intrusion,

but I just had to take
care of something.

104
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,583
Time to wipe that
smug look off your face.

It's amazing!

00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
For a guy that I thought was
a goner five minutes ago,

109
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,291
he's sure hanging
in there, huh Gohan?

110
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,291
There's something
strange about him...

111
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,791
Do you think he can take Frieza?

112

Your green friend is just fine.

And to prove it, I'll
bring him up for you.

124
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,583
Well, maybe I exaggerated
about the "just fine" part,

125
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,375
but hey, who's
keeping score anyway?

You know what? We might
even stand a chance, Gohan!

00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,625
I think you're right!

135
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,583
It's just like Vegeta said, all
we have to do is fight as one.

I'd take care of Frieza?

beat him alone!

Don't argue with me.

143
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,125
He's even a bigger fool than I

144
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,708
if he really believes he
can take on Frieza by himself.

145
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:48,208
But then again, I'm not that
stupid to tell him not to try.

how I can anticipate your
every move. Right, Horn Boy?

do against me? Huh, Frieza?

really are quite stubborn.

difference to me.

clear, that was my last warning.

00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:03,458
Now, divulge what I want,
or you won't ever get up again!

are of one body.

combined strength, you Frieza,

00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,250
are no match for our us.

180
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:25,083
I know how strong
he is. I fought him...

181
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,083
If we unite, you'll
be much stronger...

182
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,208
If we don't use every scrap of
what we have to fight him,

183
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:31,791
then we're done for...

184
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:33,750
Yeah, right. I doubt that.

185
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,125
[NAIL] You're one of us.
We have to work together...

186
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,791
Frieza's just too strong.

187
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,750
I'm not trying to
trick you, brother.

188
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:46,166
Please! All I'm doing is
trying to help you out...

189
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,500
[PICCOLO] Why not? Alright.

190
00:18:54,958 --> 00:19:02,000
[PICCOLO grunting]

191
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,666
[grunting continues]

192
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,916
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

193
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,916
I can do this! I can win,
I feel great! Aah! Yes! Yes!

194
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,541
[PICCOLO growls]

195
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:40,500
[PICCOLO laughs]

196
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,416
[FRIEZA whimpers]

197
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,333
[GOHAN whimpers]

198
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,708
Oh boy...

199
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:49,416
I-I don't believe this!

200
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,291
Now that I have
gained ultimate power,

201
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,541
it's time to finish off
this little game.

202
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,416
[PICCOLO growls]

203
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,916
[FRIEZA grunts]

204
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,875
[PICCOLO shouts]

205
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,208
[FRIEZA yells]

206
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,458
[YELLING continues]

207
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,625
[FRIEZA roars]

208
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,166
Huh? What's happening? Piccolo!

209
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,208
Piccolo, no!

210
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,208
No! You can't!

211
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,916
[PICCOLO growls]

212
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,333
[PICCOLO yells]

213
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:12,875
[yelling continues]

214
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,666
[PICCOLO roars]

215
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,375
[FRIEZA whimpers]

216
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,833
[PICCOLO shouts]

217
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,750
[FRIEZA screams]

218
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,416
He did it...

219
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:33,208
[FRIEZA growls]

220
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,083
[FRIEZA] You're dead!

221
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,875
[growling continues]

222
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,000
[NARRATOR] Even with
their combined strength,

223
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:45,666
Piccolo and Nail still
can't defeat Frieza.

224
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,583
It looks like there's only
one hope left for our heroes.

225
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,541
Can Goku make it in time?

226
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,791

next Dragon Ball Z!
