more lethal and cunning

350
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,041
than even the Androids!

351
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,166
What are you talking about?

352
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,833
Explain yourself
right now, you hear me?!

353
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,250
[KAMI]
I'm sure the day will come

354
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,958
when I give up being
guardian of the earth.

355
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,541
Then, and only then, can we
ever unite to fight as one.

356
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,166
[KAMI grunts]
[PICCOLO groans]

357
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,000
[growling]

358
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,000
[KAMI] Piccolo!

359
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,916
We will wait for
this new evil to surface.

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,708
And you will trust me.

361
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,125
I know what is
best for the earth.

362
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:23,708
But until I know exactly
what we're dealing with

363
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,000
I cannot make my decision!

364
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,125
[NARRATOR] Things are getting
interesting for our heroes.

365
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,250
While a monstrous creature
has mysteriously

366
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,666
come from the future
in Trunks' time machine,

367
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,958
three unstoppable
Androids are preparing

368
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,666
to bear down on a sickly Goku!

369
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,875
If Kami's hunch is correct,
the world faces a danger

370
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,458
unlike any it has
ever faced before!

371
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Is there anyone who can
oppose this terrible threat?

372
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:51,000
Find out, on the
next exciting episode

373
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,500
of Dragon Ball Z!
