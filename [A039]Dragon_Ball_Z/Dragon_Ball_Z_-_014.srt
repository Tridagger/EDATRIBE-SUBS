00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,750
Goku kept on running down Snake
Way trying to find King Kai.

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:20,875
Unfortunately, an unexpected
detour lay just ahead.

4
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,875
After hitching a ride
with a street cleaner,

5
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,458
he caught some shut eye,

6
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,916
but a bump in the road sent him
hurtling into the underworld.

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,666
Unaware of how he got
there or where he was,

8
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,916
he got an even
bigger surprise when

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,333
he met two
rambunctious ogres

10
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,500
who were eager
to play with him.

11
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,083
But there was no
time for games,

12
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,916
and Goku was eager to get back
on Snake Way any way he could.

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,125
The ogres made him an
offer he couldn't refuse.

14
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,041
If he could beat them
in a competition

15
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,000
he would be allowed
to leave...

16
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,708
And sure enough, he did...

17
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,166
Happy to win the grand
prize, as well as steal

18
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,625
some very special fruit that
gave him some extra strength,

19
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:05,541
Goku made a hasty exit.

20
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:08,958
But as everyone knows,
you can never trust an ogre!

21
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,416
Sure, Goku was allowed
to leave the underworld,

22
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,750
but he was sent right back
to where he started from...

23
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,458
To King Yemma's house!

24
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,375
Uh... hi there,
great King Yemma!

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,291
I thought you were
on Snake Way?

26
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,458
[GOKU] Uh, I am!
I mean, I was! I mean--

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,458
I should get going.
Bye, bye!

28
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,250
Hm. Goodness.
How strange.

29
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,333
[NARRATOR] Now Goku
has really got to hustle

30
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,791
if he wants to
find King Kai

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:36,500
and get that special martial
arts training he needs...

32
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,375
There are two Saiyans
on their way to earth

33
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,750
and he's got to get back
before they get there!

34
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:44,208
Let's hope that
he makes it!

35
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,500
[thinking] Good!
I think I'm almost back

36
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,458
to where I was
when I fell off!

37
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,833
Uh... Hm...
No-good hoodlum!

38
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,333
If that guy
doesn't slow down,

39
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,958
I'm going to have to clean him
off the back of this baby!

40
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,083
Hey! Slow down!

41
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Holy cow! That's that same
guy I ran into the other day.

42
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,416
Boy, I tell ya, that guy
should get a ticket

43
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
for reckless running!

44
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,041

Ouch...

[NARRATOR] While Goku gets
back on track, on Earth,

50
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,833
deep in the desert, Piccolo
is focusing his powers

51
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,375
and working on his own
special kind of training...

High atop Korin Tower,

65
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,458
the other members of the Z
warriors have gathered...

66
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,625
Eagerly they await their first
martial arts training session

with the one
and only Kami.

68
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm glad to see that you
two guys were called up.

69
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,833
This is great!
I'm totally psyched!

70
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:37,791

training should be excellent!

knows how to grow fruit!

I feel incredible!

77
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,375
I might make it to see King
Kai in time after all!

Huh? Wow. Check that
out. This must be it.

80

This place looks like
it's fit for a king,

81
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,958
but it doesn't seem
like anyone's home!

just dropped in to see her!

Excuse me, princess.
You have a visitor.

Let's take a peek,
shall we? Hmm?

94
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,875
From what I can see,
he seems nice enough!

Let's get a better
look... Oh, my!

Ah...! Mmm, goody,
he's handsome, too!

meet this young gentleman!

Whoa! King Kai's
a woman?

Uh, sure enough!
And cute, too!

you bold!

[GOKU] Oh, sorry,
your highness!

I came here to study
with you, if that's okay?

Look at her highness!

106
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:36,666
I haven't seen
her so excited

107
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,666
since King Yemma dropped
by a long time ago.

108

Ah, what a
hunk of a man!

It's hard to believe a
thousand years have gone by

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,458
since he was
here last!

The real reason I came here
is to receive your training

115
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,916
so I can help my
friends back on Earth!

had any training before?

[thinking] Wow! This is
kinda strange!

121
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,125
So this is the famous
martial art of King Kai?

You're a natural! Next
time I'll let you lead!

to you, my boy?

be doing really good

King Kai is testing me!

the vulnerable moment

she's Princess Snake!

beauty all over the land

and you must apologize
to her right now!

were King Kai. See you later.

since I've been hungry

King Yemma's special fruit!

three months now

good appetite. Sure! I'll stay!

that I'd like him to
stay a little longer!

Get it? Our guest
won't be leaving!

You'll make sure of
that, won't you?

Sure, no problem!
I've got the very thing!

I'll just grind it up and put
it in the soup broth...

And he'll fall right asleep
just like a little baby!

It's a little crude, but it
sounds like it should work!

00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,958
My belly, that is!

343
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,500
Oh, and watch out for
my digestive juices!

344
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,541
They're hot enough to melt
even the toughest of men!

345
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:51,041
Man, I've got to get out of
here before I turn into goo!

346
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,916
Come on!

347
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,000
[GOKU]
Yes!

348
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,125
[PRINCESS SNAKE roars]

349
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,583
Whew! That
was close! Ahh!

350
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,958
[PRINCESS SNAKE]
Sss, you rat!

351
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:21,500
[PRINCESS SNAKE
hisses and growls]

352
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,750
[PRINCESS SNAKE hisses]

353
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,250
[GOKU yowls]

354
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,375
[GOKU pants]

355
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,750
Ah... That does it!

356
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:44,125
Ka... Me...
Hey, wait! I can't!

357
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,166
She gave me
that nice meal!

358
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:49,041
Hey! How 'bout
we call a truce?

359
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,500
All I really want is to get
back on the road to King Kai's!

360
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,291
I'll chase you for
eternity if I have to!

361
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,291
[PRINCESS SNAKE roars]

362
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,833
Whoa!

363
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,375
I know!

364
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,166
[PRINCESS SNAKE roars]

365
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,791
[PRINCESS SNAKE yells]

366
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,583
Gotcha!

367
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,041
[PRINCESS SNAKE yells]

368
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,833
You!

369
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:32,208
Bye! I'd stay a while,
but you're all tied up!

370
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,916
Wait! Come back!

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
[fighting noises]

372
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,958
[TIEN &amp; KRILLIN grunt]

373
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:44,833
[CHIAOTZU &amp; YAMCHA grunt]

374
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,541
[thinking] These men are full
of fire, but it's not enough!

375
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,875
Goku, we need you!

376
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:00,333
[NARRATOR] For centuries,
outer space has been known

377
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:05,458
to be peaceful...
Until now...

378
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,291
On the outskirts of
the solar system,

379
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,166
two beings with
incredible powers

380
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,916
are on their way
to planet Earth.

381
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,375
And if they make it, they will
change our world forever...

382
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,666
That is, unless they
can be stopped!

383
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,666
Goku has escaped yet again
from another dangerous trap

384
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,583
and is back
on Snake Way.

385
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,416
He is still in the
running to save Earth,

386
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,875
but first he must
find King Kai.

387
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,250
He needs to learn a special
kind of martial arts

388
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,500
that only the
King can provide.

389
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,291
But the Saiyan warriors
are getting closer,

390
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,666
and the clock is
ticking towards

391
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,750
the day of
their arrival.

392
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,708
The Z warriors have made
it to Kami's place,

393
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,416
and are busy training for
their inevitable meeting

394
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,166
with the
deadly duo...

395
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,500
But will they have
they strength

396
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,208
to face them
in battle?

397
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,458
Or is Goku our
only chance?

398
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,666
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
