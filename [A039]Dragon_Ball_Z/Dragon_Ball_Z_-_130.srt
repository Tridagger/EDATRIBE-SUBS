00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,875
A vicious attack now,
could be sufficient!

179
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,333
[thinking] How can
he be so confident?

180
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,791
What is he hiding?

181
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,000
[thinking] Yes!
He is shrewd!

182
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,375
He seems completely
at ease, but is he?

183
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,708
Let me ask you this:

184
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,208
What makes you think
that you are going to do

185
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,125
any better than him?

186
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,916
You're an android, too!

187
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,208
I bet your head rolls
just as well as his does!

188
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,458
Fool.

189
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:53,333
I am far superior to
the Android 19 model.

190
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:58,708
Stamping you out of existence
is a trifle for a unit like me.

191
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,916
You're bluffing, friend!
Let's se what you've got!

[ANDROID 20 growls]

193
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,125
[VEGETA] Hm!

194
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,250
Oh, man!
There he goes!

195
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,083
Wow! He's running!

196
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:19,958
Hey, Baldy, hurry!
Throw me one of those beans!

197
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,166
[KRILLIN] Huh?!

198
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,041
Uh, hey!
Wait a sec!

199
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:29,041
Listen, you idiot!
He's going to get away!

200
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,916
[PICCOLO growls]

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,875
Krillin! Do it!

202
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:35,375
Whatever you say!

203
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,166
[KRILLIN] Heh!
I'll give him a small one!

204
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,625
[KRILLIN grunts]

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,375
[VEGETA] Ahh!

206
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,875
[VEGETA growls]

207
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,875
[VEGETA] I appreciate
the assistance

208
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,958
but you're not
needed here anymore.

209
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,666
You should go home
where it's safe!

210
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,083
You'll only get in my way!

211
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,541
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?!

212
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:13,125
[KRILLIN growls]
Well, good riddance!

213
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,291
Man, that guy is
the biggest jerk!

214
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,125
I have to agree with you,

215
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,333
but he's a genius when
it comes to fighting!

216
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,708
Vegeta was weakened
by the other Android.

217
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,833
He was vulnerable so
he bluffed and acted

218
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,750
like he was eager to
fight the next one!

219
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,250
That other android could
have defeated Vegeta

220
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,375
if he would have called
the bluff and attacked,

221
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,000
but Vegeta was too convincing.

222
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,500
Mentally, he's
impossible to beat.

223
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,125
He thinks of every
conceivable advantage.

224
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,541
And physically, he's
reached a new plateau!

225
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:46,500
I've never seen a power
quite like his before!

226
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,416
It's radical! Just amazing!

227
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,833
[GOHAN] Wow!

228
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,666
Do you think Vegeta's even
stronger than my Dad now?

229
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,041
There's a good chance,
yes. I think so.

230
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,041
--[KRILLIN] What?!
--[TIEN] Wow! Man o' man!

231
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,208
[KRILLIN] Whoa!

232
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,875
I say we go find them!

233
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,875
Vegeta may be stronger than us,

234
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,791
but that doesn't
make him my boss!

235
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:08,958
Yeah! Mine either!

236
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:11,166
We have just as much at stake!

237
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,458
We can't just
take off right now!

238
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,000
There's no way!

239
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:20,750
Agreed. He might need our help.

240
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,208
But no jumping in unless I say!

241
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,875
I need to get you guys
back to Goku in one piece!

242
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,583
Vegeta's probably
looking for him

243
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,250
in the mountains
as we speak.

244
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,958
But he's going
to be hard to find

245
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,416
since we can't sense
his energy level.

246
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,791
So spread out, lay low,
and find that tin-can!

247
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,916
[TIEN] Got it!

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,958
[PICCOLO] If you spot him,
call it out!

249
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,416
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Right!

250
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,666
[thinking] Where are you?!

251
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,875
Coward!

252
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,416
Come out!

253
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,375
Show yourself!

254
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,875
How long do you want
to play hide and seek?!

255
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:44,416
If you androids experience fear,
you must feel shame, too!

256
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,916
So stop running
away and fight!

257
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,666
[VEGETA] This is ridiculous!
An android that's scared to die!

258
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,000
What a low-rate pile of junk!

259
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,500
No guts at all!

260
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,791
Just circuits and wires!

here all day and night!

262

I'll blast you out!

His frustration is apparent.

He is no longer the cool,
confident fighter

that he was before.

296
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,250
Heh!

00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:49,541
Perhaps the great Vegeta
can be beaten afterall.

[ANDROID 20 grunts]

299
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,041
[thinking] The risk
of fighting him

300
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,708
in my present condition
is still too great...

301
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,125
I must recharge to maximum
power if I am to beat him.

302
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,750
I will wait for
another opportunity

303
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,000
to steal more energy,

304
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,708
but Vegeta till not make
the same mistake twice.

305
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,833
There must be a way
to acquire more energy...

306
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,583
But how?

307
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,041
Hmm...?

Ah, yes, it is the boy.

310
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,166
So he followed us afterall.

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,833
Hmm...

just solved my energy problem.

from these pathetic fools

you can never get back!
