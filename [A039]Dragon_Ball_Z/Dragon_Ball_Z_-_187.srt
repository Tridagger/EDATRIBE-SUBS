The battle between
Cell and Gohan raged on.

And Gohan demonstrated
that his powers

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,625

Cell was forced to reveal
the full extent of his power.

Until now, the evil android

but against Gohan's
awesome abilities,

16
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:52,958
he had no choice but
to pull out all the stops.

17
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,000
Cell expected to see the
fresh-faced challenger

18
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,833
turn and run, but the
gifted young Super Saiyan

19
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,291

the heroic youth put
Cell's lights out.

30
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:28,750

Gohan just won it all!

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,125

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,625

would be such a blast.

183
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,000
[KRILLIN chuckles]

184
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,583
No! Cell is still alive!

185
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,583
There's no way he could be!

186
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,458
[KRILLIN] Yeah, that energy wave
swallowed him up completely!

187
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,375
[thinking] It looks
like Piccolo's right.

188
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,083
Gohan might
have slowed him down,

189
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,875
but he is still very much alive.

190
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:15,625
[CELL growls]

191
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:26,000
Heh...

192
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,791
[thinking] Gohan's power has
grown far beyond mine.

193
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,250
When were training in
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

194
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,375
I knew he had hidden strengths,

195
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,333
but I never knew he
would ascend to this level...

196
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:43,875
[GOKU &amp; GOHAN grunting]

197
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,958
[grunting,
blows landing]

198
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,125
[GOKU thinking]
Each time we trained,

199
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,583
his energy level increased,

200
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,583
and I saw his
fighting techniques improve.

201
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,291
It wasn't long before
he was as good as me.

202
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,666
[GOHAN grunts]

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,458
[GOKU gasps]

204
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,666
[GOKU thinking] Even when I
knew he couldn't take any more

205
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,375
he refused to give up!

206
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,416
[GOHAN whimpers]

207
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:27,583
[GOKU chuckles]

208
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,166
Let's call it a day.

209
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,333
We practiced for
twenty hours already!

210
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,250
Come on, Gohan I think
it's time for a break.

211
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,125
[GOHAN] Wait, Dad!

212
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,250
[GOKU gasps]

213
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:57,166
[GOHAN grunts]

214
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,333
[GOHAN] Let's keep going!

215
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,791
[GOKU thinking]
Watching Gohan that day,

216
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,541
I realized that there were
hidden depths to his power

217
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,250
I would never
even begin to fathom!

218
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,125
[GOKU thinking]
And that's when I knew!

219
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,708
If anyone was going to
have a chance at beating Cell,

220
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,166
it would be him.

221
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:25,791
[GOHAN yells]

222
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,458
[thinking] I'm proud
of you, Gohan.

223
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,166
You've mastered
your powers.

224
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,333
Now go show Cell
what you're made of!

225
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,500
[TIEN] Hey, what's wrong?
What's he waiting for?!

226
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,333
No! He's a boy!

227
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,250
There's no way that little
brat can be so strong!

228
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,583
[PICCOLO gasps]

229
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,750
Hey! If he waits too long,
Cell will regenerate himself!

230
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,125
[ALL] Huh?!

231
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,500
Remember, he has
my cells inside him!

232
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,916
Gohan!

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,291
You've got to take Cell down
now before he can regenerate!

234
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,125
Take him down now?

235
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,375
No, I think I'll wait.

236
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,541
I'm going to let him
suffer for a little while.

237
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,333
Wait? No, Gohan...

238
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,750
[PICCOLO] He's running
out of time, Goku!

239
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,958
Yeah!

240
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:36,166
[CELL grunts]

241
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,291
Gohan! Listen to me! You've
got to get him! Do it now!

242
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:48,416
We all know you have the
power! It's time to use it!

243

How dare you?!

250
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:27,750
HOW DARE YOU?!!

254
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,375
[KRILLIN] Oh no! Cell's
back to his old evil self!

255
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,333
Boy! You won't defeat me!

256
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:51,541
A worthless Saiyan like
you can't compete with me!

257
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,958
I am invincible!

258
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,916
And now I will make you pay!

[CELL grunting]

263
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,375
Look! Cell might have power,
but he can't catch Gohan!

264
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:18,041
He's too bulky! His size
is slowing him down!

265
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,458

done to me...?

00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,791
Hey! Look!

274
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,041
Looks like something's
happening to Cell!

275
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,458
He's sick!

276
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,958
It won't be long now.

277
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,000
Huh...?

278
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,625
His life force
is getting weaker...

279
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,291
And in a moment,
Cell's complete power

280
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,875
will have left him for good!

281
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,000
What? How do you know that?

282
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:39,208
[PICCOLO] Watch and
you'll see what I mean.

283
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:04,041
What?! What's that?!

285
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,083
[TIEN] Look...
it's Android 18!

286
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,958
I don't believe it! She was
inside Cell the whole time!

287
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,500
What...? But it can't be!
I thought she was a goner!

288
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,916
But if she's free,
then what does that mean?

289
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,166
The end of Cell!

290
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,875

you're right, Piccolo...

294
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,041
[NARRATOR] Now that
Gohan has freed Android 18

295
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:44,416
from the belly of the beast,
Cell's power is fading fast.

296
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,958
Gohan knows that with
his Super Saiyan strength

297
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,750
he could finish Cell off easily.
But what is he waiting for?!

298
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,250
Stay tuned for scenes from
the next exciting episode

299
