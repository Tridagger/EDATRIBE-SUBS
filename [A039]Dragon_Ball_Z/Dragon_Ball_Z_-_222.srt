00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,541
the Z warriors discovered
the hiding place

4
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,541
of the wizard
Babidi's spaceship.

5
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:23,000
Dabura, King of the Demon World
welcomed them by blasting

6
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,416
the Supreme Kai's sidekick
Kibito to smithereens.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,375
But he didn't stop there.

8
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:32,250
He had more than a mouthful
for anyone that got in his way.

[PICCOLO grunts]

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,291
[NARRATOR] Dabura turned
Piccolo and Krillin to stone,

14
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,208
but there was no time
for the good guys to

15
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,916
ponder the fate of their
concrete comrades.

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They decided to
launch a full-on assault

17
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,416
against the wicked wizard

18
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,875
and headed into the
heart of Babidi's ship.

19
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,333
With three of the Earth's
most powerful fighters

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,625
falling right into his hands,
Babidi is now confident

21
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:10,791
he can resurrect the monster
Majin Buu ahead of schedule.

22
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,458
[BABIDI] I'd be shocked if
any one of them had a brain.

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,291
[BABIDI laughs]

24
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:18,083
[DABURA chuckles]
Yes, trapped so easily...

25
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,375
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu
lies dormant in his shell

26
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,458
waiting to be released
so that he can wreak havoc

27
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,041
on planet Earth.

28
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:27,041
All he needs is enough power to
break the spell that binds him.

29
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,708
Babidi knows that if he can
drain Goku, Gohan and Vegeta

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,500
of their power it will be more
than enough to free Majin Buu.

31
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,125
So he's used his magic to
manipulate a fierce force

32
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,166
of warriors into
fighting for him.

33
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,958
And now, Vegeta must
face the first fighter,

34
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,958
the powerful Pui Pui.

35
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,375
[PUI PUI chuckles]
Welcome, fellow warriors.

36
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,583
You've arrived at Stage One.

37
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,666
[PUI PUI] Master Babidi is at
the bottom level of this ship.

38
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,041
We are currently on the top
level, also known as Stage One.

39
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,041
And there's no way of
getting down to him

40
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,416
unless you beat the warrior
that appears at each stage.

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,666
[NARRATOR] Babidi has
cleverly designed his ship

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,791
to absorb the
power of the fighters.

43
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,333
There are three stages that
the Z Warriors must pass

44
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
if they want to get
to the wizard.

45
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:16,041
But at each level a new and more
powerful foe waits for them.

46
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,458
Can the good guys get Babidi
before he gets them first?

47
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,791

gotten a lot stronger.

Just look at him...
He's losing...

That's not good, not good all.

get energy for Majin Buu

He's used his magic to

[PUI PUI] I've won

115
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,791
And by now, you've
noticed that my planet

116
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,041
is very different from yours.

117
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,083
It's the gravity! Ten times
stronger than Earth!

118
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,500
Your hopes of winning are
falling faster than that stone!

[VEGETA] Maybe if this was

00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,000
you might have an advantage.

But ten?

going to try and change

this room with his magic, too.

beat Pui Pui far too easily!

there was no one

come and find me,

since his match with Trunks.

too embarrassed

finish everyone off,

smash through the floor

bottom of this place?!

[We can't do that! Even though
he's not at full power,

Augh. I'm beginning to think
that this Majin Buu

can't be serious.

I've seen of Dabura so far

I don't see any reason
to be so afraid of him.

I watched his
movements outside

346
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,708
and the only thing I have
to worry about is his spit.

347

If I avoid that,
I know I can beat him.

About seven years ago, we
fought this guy named Cell.

354
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:10,125
Now that was tough! Oh-ho!

355
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,083
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
I can't believe this...

356
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:15,375
Can these Super Saiyans
really be that strong?

357
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,625
[SUPREME KAI thinking]
I suppose it is possible.

358
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,333
It was extremely difficult to
restrain Gohan's movements

359
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,166
after he became a
Super Saiyan...

360
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,750
And that may not even
have been his full power!

361
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:32,958
Hey! Get out here now!

362
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,333
Let's go! I'm ready to fight!

363
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,625
Huh...?

364
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,250
[YACON growls]

365
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,708
[GOKU]
Uh...

366
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:56,875
[YACON growls]

367
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:00,583
[GOKU, GOHAN gasp]

368
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,708
What is that thing?!

369
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:17,583
[YACON snarls]

370
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,000
That's it... Be a good boy,
Yacon, and finish him off

371
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,041
for me! [laughs]

372
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,541
[YACON roars]

373
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,458
What...? Oh no!

374
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:36,208
[YACON growls]

375
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,000
[NARRATOR It looks like Babidi's
pet monster Yacon

376
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,708
is about to have a
Super Saiyan for lunch.

377
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,958
Goku had better be on his toes.

378
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,541
One slip, and all his
power could be drained and

379
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,791
sent straight to Majin Buu.

380
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,708
Could this be Goku's
most difficult fight yet?

381
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,041
Find out on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
