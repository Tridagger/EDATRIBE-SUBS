00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,166
a repentant Vegeta courageously
gambled his own life

3
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,958
to avenge the fallen Gohan.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,291
Unfortunately, even this
bold, selfless act

5
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,458
wasn't enough to put an end
to the horrible Majin Buu.

6
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,625
Vegeta crumbled, and the
Z Fighters hopes of victory

7
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,458
were scattered to the wind.

8
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:34,416
If a sacrifice of this magnitude
ultimately proved futile,

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,041
what chance could they
have of defeating Babidi

10
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,375
and his monster?

11
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,791
[BUU]
Buuuu!

12
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,916
[NARRATOR]
What would our heroes try next?

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,166
[BABIDI] Doesn't make
much of a difference.

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,125
[NARRATOR]
Is Babidi right to be so cocky?

15
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,458
Is this odd creature under
his control truly invincible?

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,166
It wouldn't seem so,
judging from his face,

17
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,208
but Majin Buu has
already shown the deceit

18
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,208
of that innocent smile.

19
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,750
Up at the Lookout,

20
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,916
even Goku doubted his ability to
overcome the monstrous Buu.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,333
As evenly matched as they
were in their last fight,

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,708
if Vegeta couldn't stop
Buu, how could he?

23
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,583
But as the others soon learned,

24
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,208
Goku mourned the loss of
his fellow Saiyans

25
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,500
for another reason.

26
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,833
[GOKU]
We could've done a fusion!

27
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,458
[gasps]

28
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,458
Fusion? You mean a merger?!

29
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:20,958
It's an ancient merger art

30
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,500
that can be performed
between two people

31
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,291
of similar size and
physical ability.

32
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,875
You wanna try that again?

33
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,166
[NARRATOR] And as Goku explained
this new method of Fusion

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,666
he'd learned in Other World,

35
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,291
the Z fighters came up
with a most unusual idea.

36
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,625
Making a fusion
requires two warriors

37
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,208
of equal size and strength.

38
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:40,625
And the young Goten and Trunks
seemed to be a perfect match.

39
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,333
A new strategy begins!

40
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,666
[GOKU] We can't ever
give up hope, you guys.

41
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,333
[thinking]
I must find the Supreme Kai,

42
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,416
but I can't detect his presence.

43
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,041
What if the worst has...

44
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:09,666
No, I won't allow myself
to think that! Not yet...

45
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,000
Huh...?

46
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,916
Oh, he's still alive!

47
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,166
[KIBITO] Don't worry, Master.
Wherever you are, I'll find you!

48
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,750
[SUPREME KAI whimpers]

49
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,375
Gohan must still
be alive, I can feel it.

50
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:41,291
He has... to be...

51
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,666
He's the only one...

52
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,208
[groans]

53
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,500
Hey, Majin Buu! Where in
blazes are you taking me?

54
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:10,750
[BUU hums]

55
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,291
Hey!

56
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,375
Buu!

57
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,166
[growls, screams]

58
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,375
[PEOPLE gasping]

59
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,250
[BUU]
Buu stick landing!

00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,083
[DRIVER]
What the...?!

61
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,458
Hey, listen punk,
I'm driving here!

62
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,541
That's it! Stinkin' tourists.
Don't know where they're goin'.

63
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:38,708
You yell to Buu? Bye-bye!

64
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,166
"Bye-bye"?

65
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,833
[CROWD gasps, screams]

66
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,458
You... go bye-bye now!

67
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,208

68
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,291
[DRIVER screams]

69
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,125
Buu!

70
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:55,625
[CROWD screaming]

71
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,333
Where do you
think you're going?

72
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,958
Wait! I command you!

73
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:00,958
[mutters] Oh, what's the use?

74
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,416
[BOTH]
Huh...?

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,791

00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,166
Oh, sir, are you all right?!
Have you been injured at all?

78
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:28,458
[BUU] Buu, like!
Buu, like! Buu, like! Buu, like!

79
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,375
[laughs]

80
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,125
Welcome to our store, sir...

81
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,041
Can I help you get
anything today, sir?

82
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,125
Want all!

83
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,791
Ah, you want all? I-I don't...

Majin Buu! Stop this! Let's go!

to be back here!

[BAKERS yell]

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,958
[BUU]
Buu want more!

96
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,625
Quit stuffing your face, you're
fat enough already! Let's go!

97
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,791
Buu have more hungry!

98
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,333
Wait up! Majin Buu--

99
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,666
[BABIDI] What's going on here?
Why have I stopped?

100
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,833
Oh, it's you.
What are you looking at?!

101
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:18,250
If you'll kindly remove your
Amazonian person from my cape,

102
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:19,541
I'll leave!

103
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,375
You're not going anywhere,
you wrinkled freak.

104
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,541
[BABIDI]
Why, how dare you--

105
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,541
[WAITRESS B]
Can it!

106
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:26,333
I'll have you know
something, bub!

107
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,791
If you don't pay
for your friend's cakes

108
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,291
and the windows and the walls,

109
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,458
THEN it comes
out of my paycheck!

110
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,666
So, you're not going anywhere

111
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,291
until you flash
the cash, mister.

112
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:38,916
Young lady, apparently you don't
know who you're disrespecting.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,541
Apparently.

114
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,333
Well, my insolent little child

115
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,250
you won't remain oblivious
to my genius much longer.

116
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,625
In fact you may not remain
at all much longer for, you see,

117
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,083
I hold the fate of the
entire universe in my hands.

118
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,125
I am the great wizard Babidi!

119

[gasps]

120
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,208
I don't care if you pull
a rabbit out of a hat,

121
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,833
if you don't make some money
appear right this instant,

122
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,208
we'll see if you can fly!

123
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,541
[BABIDI screams]

124
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,416
I'll show you what
I can do: Paparapa!

125
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,500
OUCH!

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,125
She left us...

127
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,208
You want a piece of
me too, Blondie?!

128
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,000
[whimpers]

129
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,916
[WAITRESS B] Somebody please
get me down from here!

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,125
[whines] Somebody!

131
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,500
[POLICE CHIEF] This is the
police. We have you surrounded.

132
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,250
Come out peacefully
with your hands up,

133
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,458
and nobody's gonna hurt.

134
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,625
Majin Buu! Haven't you had
more than your fill yet?!

135
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,416
[BUU] Buu's tummy super big,
these cakes itsy-bitsy,

136
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,916
but they taste
so very yum, yum, yum.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,291
[BABIDI] Well, those blue people
outside want the cakes, too!

138
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,625
They don't want you
to have any of it!

139
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,666
Huh?!

140
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,833
[BABIDI]
They told me so themselves.

You're under arrest.

[BABIDI]
That was fabulous, Buu!

156
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,500
A little more of
that kind of action

157
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,583
and we'll be terrorizing entire
galaxies with no one to stop us.

Oh yes, boys. We're coming.

160

You don't mess with the great
Babidi and get away with it.

[KIBITO thinking] I can't
sense his life force anymore.

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,375
I must be too late!

for your loss, noble creature.

168
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,500
But at least there's still
some hope for my Master.

169
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,875
Huh?!

170
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,750

This just might be him!

Then I'm not too late!

00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,250
Master?

178
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,583
[SUPREME KAI grunts]

179
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,250
Greetings, Master!

180
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,125
K-Kibito?!

181
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,166
What's going on here?

182
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,208
I watched Dabura kill you
right before my eyes!

183
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,666
Is this Other World?

184
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,250
[SUPREME KAI] So you just awoke
as though nothing had happened?

185
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,791
How very peculiar.

186
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,000
[KIBITO]
Yes, indeed.

187
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,166
I must admit, I was
quite surprised myself.

188
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,458
I was certain I was dead.

189
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,333
Ah! It's Gohan!

190
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,250
Huh?

191
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,958
Kibito! Hurry!

192
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:12,250
Gohan's life hangs
in the balance!

193
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,375
No matter what, we absolutely
cannot let him die!

194
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,291
[BABIDI]
Come on, Buu.

195
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,375
No.

196
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,916
[BABIDI] I wish you'd stop being
such a miserable sourpuss.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,333
We're about to take over
the world, you know.

198
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,000
Buu still hungry!

199
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,541
Kibito, do you feel that?

200
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,791
Majin Buu's power level

201
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,166
continues to increase
substantially.

202
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,625
Yes, of course.

203
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,416
His negative energy is
impossible for me to ignore.

204
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,416
It seems that...

205
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,958
even after being
out of commission

206
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:47,166
for thousands of years,

207
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,041
Majin Buu is as unstoppable
a force as ever.

208
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,000
Every horrible possibility
that I never even dared to fear

209
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,000
has materialized today.

210
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,875
This situation's not
entirely hopeless.

211
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,583
There's a possible
beacon of light

212
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,458
that has made
itself known to me.

213
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,333
Huh? Are you sure?

214
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,250
Does this have anything at all
to do with our search for Gohan?

215
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,416
It does...

216
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,583
Let's just say for now
that Majin Buu,

217
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,708
however invincible he
might seem to us,

218
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,125
may not necessarily be the
most impressive force

219
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,708
in the universe.

220
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,625
[KIBITO]
Master, what are you saying?

221
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,625
Surely you can't expect
me to believe that--

222
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,000
[SUPREME KAI]
Of course.

223
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,375
You can't believe it because
you haven't witnessed

224
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,083
the awesome power of the
Super Saiyans for yourself.

225
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,625
We'd best hasten our search.

226
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,416
Gohan's fragile
life force is waning.

227
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,625
I can just barely sense its
remains in that forest up ahead.

228
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,666
Hurry, Kibito,
before we're too late.

229
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,291
He should be around
here somewhere.

230
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,250
[KIBITO]
There he is, right over there!

231
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,500
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes, that's him!

232
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,041
He's still alive. However,
he's in a critical state,

233
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,416
like you were before
I revived you, Master.

234
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,833
Ah! Then there's hope.

235
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:11,750
[SUPREME KAI]
No!

236
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,125
Huh...?

237
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,791
Kibito, let's wait to
restore Gohan's energy

238
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,000
until we take him with us
back to our world.

239
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,875
Huh?! But, Master!

240
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,208
Surely you don't suggest
bringing a mere Earthling

241
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,625
back to the World of
the Kais, do you?!

242
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,625
Why, even the Grand Kai himself

243
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,291
is not permitted to set foot
on such hallowed ground.

244
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:36,833
[SUPREME KAI] You heard me.
Now let's go home!

245
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,291
[KIBITO]
Yes, Master.

246
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,000
[KRILLIN] So, Bulma, what
did you do with your parents?

247
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,500
[BULMA] They couldn't
bring themselves to

248
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:53,833
leave their stupid pets.

249
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,541
They said that even if
they meet their horrible,

250
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,708
gruesome ends at
the hands of Majin Buu,

251
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,333
I can bring them back
with the Dragon Balls.

252
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,625
Logic must be genetic.

253
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,083
You really think so?

254
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,750
It's too dangerous down there.

255
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,708
If I only knew where
Tien and Chiaotzu were,

256
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,708
I'd tell them to come up here.

257
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,166
That's very interesting.

258
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,500
Now, where'd you say
Goten and Gohan are?

259
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,625
[gasps]

260
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,333
And what about my
Trunks? And Vegeta?

261
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,166
[whimpers]

262
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,125
You're a fool.

263
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,208
[VEGETA screams]

264
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,375
Goku, where are my sons?

265
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,583
Come on, Goku.

266
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,000
What I have to tell you
isn't easy for me

267
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,000
to say right now. But...

268
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,041
Goten and Trunks are
going to be all right.

269
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,875
But Gohan and Vegeta are dead.

270
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:17,041
[gasping]

271
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,958
Majin Buu, destroyed them both.

272
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,916
But, Gohan, he can't be!
He just can't!

273
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,625
No, ChiChi!

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,375
Vegeta...

275
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,291
Nooo! Vegeta!

276
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,291
Bulma, pull yourself
together! Bulma!

277
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,833
[BULMA wails]

278
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,458
[GOKU]
ChiChi!

279
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:59,500
[BULMA sobs]

280
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,541
Noooo!

281
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,333
ChiChi!

282
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,750
[BULMA sobs]

283
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,833
How... can this be...?

284
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,375
I love him...

285
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,541
[VIDEL]
Gohan...

286
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,916
[KORIN]
Well, well.

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,875
You know, it's never easy

288
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,166
dealing with the
loss of loved ones.

289
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,666
Hey, Korin.

290
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,083
But I'm afraid there's no
time for mourning, Goku.

291
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,666
You have to take action.

292
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,500
Even in this place, none of you
are going to be safe for long.

293
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,000
From what I've seen,

294
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,000
Majin Buu's power could soon
gobble up this whole world.

295
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,666
[BABIDI]
Snap out of it, you big baby.

296
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,875
What's the matter with you?

297
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:50,875
Buu still hungry!

298
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:54,083
All those sweets are
just empty calories...

299
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,166
I've got something
more satisfying.

300
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,958
We'll give those meddlers
their just desserts.

301
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,000
Goku, what about the fusion?

302
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,333
Good thinking!

303
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,333
Mister Popo, would you
wake up Goten and Trunks?

304
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,583
[BABIDI using ESP] People
of Earth! Can you hear me?!

305
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,291
Testing, one, two...
I am the all-seeing

306
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:16,083
all-knowing,
all-powerful wizard Babidi,

307
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,750
son of the all-seeing,
all-knowing,

308
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,458
all-powerful wizard Bibidi.

309
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:22,500
Now, now, no peeking. There's
no sense searching for me.

310
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,750
You're not even close!

311
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,333
I'm using my unprecedented
magical abilities

312
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,750
to transport my words
directly to you, the people.

313
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,916
I'm so sorry to
bother you like this,

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,541
especially if you're having
an otherwise pleasant day.

315
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,583
I, too, know what it's like to
be pestered while having fun.

316
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,958
You see, earlier today,
three nuisances did just that.

317
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,875
Now I'm simply looking
to return the favor.

318
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,291
I really am senile.

319
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,458
[MAN B] Did anybody else
hear that talkin'?

320
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,250
Uh, yeah, I don't
know. Did you?

321
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,750
[BABIDI using ESP] Now, sit
back, relax, and enjoy my show.

322
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,916
Please be courteous and remember
that silence is golden, okay?

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,125
What's he up to now?!

324
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,375
[growls]

325
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,875
[BABIDI using ESP]
I now present the stars

326
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,416
of my own personal nightmare.

327
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,625
These are the three cretins
that I'm looking for.

328
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
Get a good look at
their ugly mugs,

329
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,583
for they are the ones
to blame for any

330
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,666
and all destruction that
may come your way.

331
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,375
Come out, you cowards!

332
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,625
Unless, of course, you're
scared of little old me.

333
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,750
I've got a preview
of what's in store for you

334
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,625
if you refuse to
show your faces.

335
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, but wait. First, please
allow me to introduce myself.

336
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:30,208
The handsome devil you now
see is none other than me,

337
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,958
the great wizard Babidi.

338
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,166
And this is my faithful
servant, Majin Buu,

339
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,000
the heavyweight champion
of the universe.

340
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,083
He may not seem like much, but
he's actually quite unstoppable.

341
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,291
Just look at him pumping
his fists like that.

342
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,625
Now, do you see this city?

343
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,416
It looks like a
lovely place, doesn't it?

344
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,583
Well, its citizens are about to
get a special sneak preview

345
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,541
of the high cost
of your cowardice,

346
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,583
while you look on from
your hiding place.

347
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,500
Ah! Darn him!

348
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,625
[BABIDI using ESP] The following
material is of a violent nature

349
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,958
and may be considered

risk their own lives
