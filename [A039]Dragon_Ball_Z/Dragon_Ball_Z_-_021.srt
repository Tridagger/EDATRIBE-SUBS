[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:19,750
Gohan endured his most
severe training session yet!

3
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,458
And though the young fighter
showed vast improvement,

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
Piccolo wasn't
about to let up!

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,375
So you figured out how to
dodge my punches and kicks...

6
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,083
Now try this!

[GOHAN yells]

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,666
[NARRATOR] But Piccolo's seeming
cruelty was not without purpose.

9
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,333
For the veteran warrior
understood all too well...

10
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,583
The enemy they were
both preparing to face

11
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,666
would employ tactics
far more ruthless.

12
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,583
It's a lesson the rest
of the Z-Fighters

13
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,250
had also
taken to heart!

14
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,250
To survive the battle
against the Saiyans,

15
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,375
they knew they would have to
hone their fighting skills

16
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,125
to their highest
levels ever.

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:03:00,291
And under the watchful eye
of Kami, they did just that!

18
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,000
Meanwhile, far away
in Other World,

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,958
Goku continued
to sail through

20
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,166
King Kai's tests of strength
with flying colors!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,208
And after months of
difficult training,

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:16,333
it seems the student has
finally surpassed the teacher!

23
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,250
Goku's strength
and speed

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,916
may have him running
circles around King Kai,

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,625
but the
question is:

26
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:29,083
Will his newfound powers be
enough to stop the Saiyans?

27
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,500
The time to find out
is drawing near.

28
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,791
The two evil Saiyans are on
their final approach to Earth!

29
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:39,583

Today!

Goku, this will be

31
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,166
the last day of your
training with me.

32
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
You've done well,

33
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,375
but I'm afraid you're
lacking in one area...

34
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,791
You still can't seem
to deliver a good joke

35
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,708
when the
pressure's on!

36
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,125
Everything else is good...

37
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,458

Well, okay! Now it's time
to test the Spirit Bomb!

waiting for this!

believe it!

Well done, Goku!

74
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,625
To be perfectly honest,

75
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,291
I didn't think you'd
be able to handle

76
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,416
the Spirit Bomb
so skillfully!

77
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,000
It wasn't easy.

78
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:37,166
Mm. Goku, you
mustn't forget...

79
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,333
The energy used to
form the Spirit Bomb

80
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,708
is gathered from
all forms of life.

81
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,958
From trees... From
animals... From plants...

82
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,375
Even the particles of energy
that make up the air

83
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,291
in the atmosphere contribute
a small share of energy

84
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,916
to the bomb. Therefore,
you must be very careful.

85
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,416
You see, you have
mastered the Spirit Bomb

86
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,583
here on this
small planet.

87
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,333
But the Spirit Bomb that
you will form on Earth,

88
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,208
with its innumerable
life forms,

89
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,666
will have immense power
compared to this small one.

90
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,500
And if the sun
happens to be up

91
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,166
when you form
the Spirit Bomb,

92
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,750
you will be harnessing and
trying to control a power

93
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,125
of indescribable
magnitude

94
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:16,666
that could easily
destroy the Earth

95
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,875
if even the slightest error
is made in handling it.

96
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,875
[GOKU] Hm.

97
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,833
[KING KAI] If possible,
I'd like you to refrain

98
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,458
from using
the Spirit Bomb...

99
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,875
But if you must, use
it only once. Understand?

100
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:32,166
Mm. Got it! I'll stick to
the Kaio-Ken Technique.

101
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,750
That should do it!

102
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,583
Well, I'm afraid the
time has finally come

for us to say
our goodbyes...

arriving on Earth tomorrow.

Wh-What? What's wrong?

109

[KING KAI] I forgot to
include in my calculations

going to take you

going to zap me back to Earth!

you'll be much faster!

within two days if
you go all out!

get there a day late!

[ROSHI] Ahhh...
Well, that is a huge relief.

176
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:35,958
[GROUP] Uhh...

177
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,333
Ho-boy. Tell
ya' what...

178
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,083
I, uh, I change
my mind, Bulma.

179
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,583
You can go next
if you want.

180
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,708
That's okay.

181
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,875
[toilet flushes]

182
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,625
Hey, gang! Get the Dragon Balls!
I just talked to Goku!

183
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,375
[GROUP] Huh?!

184
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:03,250
King Kai! That was great!
I could hear him perfectly!

185
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,666
Heh, heh. Well, of course.

186
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,416
They're going
to wish me back.

187
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,416
Ah, good! Well,
while you're waiting,

188
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,416
I have a present
I'd like to give you.

189
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,416
We can't exactly have
you going into battle

190
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,375
looking all ragged
out now can we?

191
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,416
Wow! New clothes?

192
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,333
Uhhh-huh! Heh, heh, heh...

193
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,291
[GOKU chuckles]

194
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,666
Hey! These clothes
are light as a feather!

195
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Yes, I thought
you'd like that...

196
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,708
The material is light,
but it's marvelously tough!

197
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,333
[GOKU]
It's incredible!

198
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,875
Those clothes repel
attacks, too... Small ones.

199
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,083
Thank you so much,
King Kai!

200
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:42,958
Ahh! Check it out! You left
the turtle emblem! Neat.

201
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,416
Although I was
hoping that since

202
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,708
I've been training
under you,

203
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:49,375
I'd get to wear your
symbol now. Y'know?

204
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,625
Look on the back!

205
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,041
Ahh! The back!

206
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,291
Heh, heh.
What's there? I can't see it!

207
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,250
Your old master's
emblem is on the front,

208
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,083
but mine's the big
one on the back!

209
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,583
[snickers]

210
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:04,958
Great!

211
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,125
[PICCOLO yells]

212
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,458
[GOHAN yells]

213
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:29,416
Go ahead! Don't just
dodge! Get inside!

214
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,875
Haaaaa...!

215
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,583
[GOHAN yells]

216
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,333
[grunts]

217
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,791
[PICCOLO thinking] Darn it!
He surprised me...

218
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,333
That was a
reflex shot.

219
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,291
I didn't mean to
hit him so hard...

220
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,958
[GOHAN groans]

221
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,666
[sighs]

222
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:08,916
Hey... You cheated.
You said no eye-lasers.

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,333
And what if I did?!

224
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,625
You should never believe
anything the enemy tells you!

225
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:18,541
Yeah! But, I mean...
You're not the enemy.

226
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,166
[ROSHI] Alright...
Here goes!

227
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:26,916
Now!
Dragon, arise!

228
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,041
[ROSHI yells frantically]

229
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,250
[BULMA] Uh, I don't think
I'll ever get used to this...

230
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,583
[OOLONG] Yeah,
tell me about it!

231
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,416
Even my nose hairs
are standing up!

232
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,791
[screeching]

233
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:49,541
[rumbling]

234
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,666
What a storm! I've never
seen anything like it!

235
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,208
[thinking]
That's no storm...

236
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,416
[OOLONG whimpers]

237
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,291
Ugh. Hands off, pig!

238
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,958
Hey! C'mon, Bulma!
I'm scared here!

239
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,416
[GROUP yells]

240
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,041
[roaring]

241
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:43,541
Why have you summoned me?
Tell me your wish now!

242
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,208
[BULMA whimpers]

243
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,125
Yes, uh... 'Scuse me,
Mister Dragon,

244
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,458
could you possibly
destroy the Saiyans

245
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,833
that are on their way to
Earth right about now?

246
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,958
Hey, Oolong!
That's not the wish!

247
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,291
What about Goku,
you little pig?

248
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,291
What? We could
wish Goku back!

249
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,958
But why not wish
him back next time

250
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:06,125
and have the Dragon
save the world now?

251
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,916
Your wish cannot
be granted.

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,208
Because the guardian of
the Earth created me,

253
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,750
I cannot grant a wish
that exceeds his power.

254
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,458
Then I wish for Goku to
be brought back to life!

255
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:26,625
So be it. Your wish
has been granted!

256
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:38,000
[DRAGON roars]

257
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,833
[thinking] So they've
finally used the Dragon Balls

258
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,541
to wish Goku back...

259
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,750
Ah!

260
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,583
Which means the Saiyans
are going to be here

261
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,208
sooner than I expected!

262
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,458
Uh?!

263
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,875
Oh, good! Your halo's
gone! You're alive, kid!

264
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,041
Woohoo!

265
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,500
[KING KAI]
It's time, Goku!

266
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,625
Right!

267
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,958
Listen! Don't expect
those two Saiyans

268
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:17,083
to give you
a fair fight!

269
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,541
You must be on your
guard at all times!

270
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,375
If things get rough, just
kick 'em in the tail and run!

271
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,416
That's good advice...
And hey,

272
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,833
I really want to thank you
guys for all your help...

273
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,083
I promise I won't
let you down!

274
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,916
[GREGORY] Aww...

275
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,541
Oh, and thanks for the
new clothes King Kai!

276
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:38,000
I love the new symbol!
I'll wear it with pride!

277
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,416
Bye, Bubbles!
[BUBBLES chatters]

278
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,125
Gregory!

279
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,250
[GREGORY]
See ya'!

280
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,041
So long!

281
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,416
[GREGORY sighs]

282
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,083
[GROUP] Eh?!

283
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,791
[GROUP yells]

284
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,083
[GOKU]
Byyyye!

285
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,333
[GOKU laughs]

286
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:06,416
Woohoo!

287
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,875
[laughing continues]

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,250
That Goku truly does have
some incredible powers...

289
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:22,166
Not only that, but his heart
is as pure as gold!

290
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,125
It's hard to believe that
he was living down on Earth.

291
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,666
He's stronger than you
now, isn't he, King Kai?

292
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,500
[KING KAI coughs]

293
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:35,083
Well, he has surpassed me
in every area except one...

294
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,750
I am still the funniest
man in the universe!

295
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,708
[GREGORY]
Yay, hey!

296
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,250
[BUBBLES chatters
and GREGORY giggles]

297
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,750
Man! I feel
lighter than air!

298
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,583
This is great! Heh, heh!

299
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,250
Woohoo!

300
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,708
Huh?

301
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:03,750
[thinking] I almost forgot!
Every second counts!

302
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,125

[GIRL] Hey, Dad?
Can we eat, please?

305
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,208
[FATHER] Sure.
It's almost lunchtime.

306
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,333
Huh?

307
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,208
[FATHER] Huh?

308
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,416
[GIRL whimpers]

309
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,208
[FATHER]
What was that?!

310
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:13,500
[CROWD screams and yells]

311
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,833
Ahh!

312
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,666
What happened?

313
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,041
Who knows?
Help me!

314
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,708
[BUSINESS MAN]
Wh-What is it?

315
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,291
[WORKER] It's got to be
some sort'a ship...

316
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,041
[BUSINESS MAN] Wait, you mean,
like, from outer-space?

317
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,541
[WOMAN] Ah! That's it!
It's a space-pod!

318
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,291
Remember that movie
where the plant people

319
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,208
took over the city?

320
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:53,750
[MAN 1]
Someone call the cops!

321
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,458
[MAN 2] Yeah, right!
What are they gonna do?

322
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,750
They'll just say it's
a weather balloon!

323
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,208
[WOMAN] There could be thousands
of tiny aliens in there!

324
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:01,791
[MAN 3] There's another
pod over here!

325
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,833
[WORKER]
Stay calm!

326
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,500
[MAN 1] Forget that!
I'm outta here!

327
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,708

[MAN 2]
He's getting out!

330
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,125
No! It can't be!

331
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:31,166
What do they want?

332
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,250
[NAPPA groans]

333
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,916
[NAPPA] My neck
is killing me...

334
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:54,083
So, the Saiyans
are here.

335
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:58,541
That means my Dad's gonna be
back soon, too... Doesn't it?

336
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,500
Uh?!

337
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,333
[CHIAOTZU]
Wow... You feel that?

338
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:11,541
Yeah. It's them...
Without a doubt!

Heh!

[NARRATOR]
After a year of waiting,

344
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,791
the countdown to doomsday
has finally expired!

345
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:43,458
The Saiyans have landed!

346
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,875
And unless Goku and his
friends can stop them,

347
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,416
they'll carve a
path of destruction

348
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,375
across the globe in their search
for the seven Dragon Balls!
