1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,916
[GOKU bellows]

2
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,041
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,791
Goku was stranded
on the planet Namek

4
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,500
when it exploded and
was blown to smithereens!

5
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,416
[NARRATOR]
But Bulma wasn't worried,

6
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,000
because she found out that
the Dragon Balls from Namek

7
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,708
possessed certain
advantages that

8
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,541
the Earth's
Dragon Balls didn't have!

9
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:41,166
Goku, Krillin, and Chiaotzu
can all be wished back!

10
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,041
[NARRATOR] King Kai, however,
was less than enthusiastic.

11
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,958
[KING KAI] Using the Nameks'
Dragon Balls is a great idea,

12
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,750
but I'm afraid it won't
help Goku and Krillin.

13
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,083
[YAMCHA and CHIAOTZU] Huh?

14
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,083
He brings them back to
the place where they died!

15
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
Goku and Krillin died on Namek.

16
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,333
They would materialize in space.

17
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,083
Right where Namek used to be!

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,958
[NARRATOR] Is there any hope
to bring our heros back?

19
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,250
Find out, today!

20
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:26,666
[birds chirping]

21
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,625
[BULMA] Gosh, Goku...

22
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,458
Hey, there's got to be a way.

23
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,708
We just can't give up.
Whadda ya think?

24
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,375
[BULMA] I don't know, Gohan.

25
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:37,750
King Kai was
pretty clear on the matter.

26
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,333
It's no problem
to wish Chiaotzu back

27
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,250
because he died on Earth.

28
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,458
But I'm afraid it's a
completely different matter

29
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,916
with your dad and Krillin.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,083
There's no nest
to lay the eggs in!

31
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,916
Hey, that's a good analogy!

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, sure.

33
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,333
[BULMA] Your dad
and Krillin are the eggs

34
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,750
and the Dragon is the hen,

35
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,750
but there's no nest
for her to lay her eggs in!

36
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,916
And since there's not
a cozy space for the eggs,

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,291
they get cold and crack,

38
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,333
and the little chickies
end up dying.

39
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,125
That's awful. Gosh!

40
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,208
[BULMA] I'm sorry, Gohan.
I know it's hard.

41
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,250
Your dad's a really good egg.

42
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,166
--[VEGETA] Shut up!
--[BULMA] Wha--?!

43
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,375
Enough of this
ridiculous babble!

44
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,958
[gasps]

45
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,833
If you want Kakarot back,
then listen.

46
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,333
The Earth has a Check-in
Station to the spirit realm.

47
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,916
Wish him back there first.
Then wish him back to life.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,833
Hey! That might work!

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,208
[BULMA] Man, Vegeta! What a
great idea! I'm impressed!

50
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,041
[grunts]

51
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,416
[BULMA] This is awesome!

52
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,416
We need to gather
the Dragon Balls!

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,583
[GOHAN] Uh...
Thank you very much!

54
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,166
[laughs]

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,708
[VEGETA]
Don't get carried away!

56
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,583
[grunts]

57
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,625
You bunch of softies!

58
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,916
[BULMA] Huh...?

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,250
[VEGETA] Silly fools!

60
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm not interested
in helping Kakarot.

61
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,833
I want to know how
he became a Super Saiyan,

62
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,708
so I can do it too!

63
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,750
[MOORI]
Excuse me, Miss Bulma.

64
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,916
We have a request
we'd like to make.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We plan to use our Dragon Balls
to relocate to another planet.

66
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,291
But finding a suitable
home is going to take time.

67
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,125
Do you know of a place
where we can stay temporarily

68
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,958
until we can make
other arrangements.

69
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,458
[BULMA] Gosh...

70
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,916
Hey, I know! Just stay with me!

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,833
No. We mustn't impose.

72
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:17,375
Aw, hey,
it's really no biggie.

73
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,291
It's the least
I can do for you all.

74
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,333
Besides, you need a major
credit card to stay in a hotel.

75
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:23,750
Huh?

76
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,750
[BULMA] Hey, no worries.
My dad's compound is huge.

77
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,541
There's enough room
for everyone.

78
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,791
It's not like you guys
have a lot of options.

79
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,000
Green men from outer space

80
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,750
aren't a common
sight around here.

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,333
Oh, gosh! I see your point.

82
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,625
We... accept.

83
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:41,416
What about you?!
Hey, homeboy!

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,583
Huh? What? Home--what?

85
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:45,958
Hey, loosen up.

86
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,291
You're going to need
a place to crash, too.

87
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,791
Agh!

88
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,208
[BULMA] Hey, why don't you
drop the arrogant tough-guy act

89
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:52,916
and just relax. Let it all go!

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,333
Take a vacation
for goodness sake.

91
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,375
Unwind a little and see
what life has to offer you.

92
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,041
You're actually kind of cute.

93
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,250
[giggles]

94
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,708
What? I'm not kind of--!

95
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,166
Shut up!

96
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,375
All right then!
It's all settled!

97
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,041
I'm going to go call my dad
and have him pick all of us up.

98
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,625
[MOORI] Thank you so much!

99
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,833
[GOHAN] Bulma?

100
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,333
Um... do you think I could

101
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,708
stay at your house
for a little while?

102
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,958
[BULMA] What are you
talking about, kiddo?

103
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,500
You have your own beautiful
house with a wonderful mom,

104
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,666
who's probably
worried sick about you.

105
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,625
Well, yeah. But...
it'll just be for a short time.

106
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,750
Please? Just 'til
I finish my homework.

107
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,416
[DR. BRIEF] What's the
deal here? Darn thing!

108
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,250
Oh, there!

109
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,708
All right, gang,
everything is a go!

110
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,708
Now remember,
when you first take-off

111
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,291
it's going to feel like
someone's trying to

112
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,500
pull your brains out
through your feet!

113
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,375
But once you clear
the Earth's atmosphere,

114
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,125
you're going to feel
like you're walking on

115
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,333
a cushion of air!

116
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,541
Now everyone, are you ready?!

117
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,083
[ALL grunt]

118
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:05,458
It's about time! I'm ready
for action! Lock and load!

119
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,625
[DR. BRIEF]
Uh, just a moment.

120
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,791
I have a phone-call
coming in. Please standby.

121
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,125
Uh, sorry. That was Bulma.
She's back on Earth!

122
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:21,250
She said that Gohan
is with her as well!

123
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,583
Huh?

124
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,541
[DR. BRIEF] Does anyone
still want to go to Namek

125
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,208
or should I cancel the flight?

126
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,791
[ALL yell]

127
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,791
[CHICHI]
Step on it! Oh, come on!

128
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,375
I could walk faster
than this piece of junk!

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,916
[whimpers]

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,041
Hey, that's them! All right!

131
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,541
Yo! Dad! We're down here!

132
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,541
Gohan! It's Mommy!

133
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,083
Huh? Well, where is he?

134
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,083
Gohan! It's you!

135
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,250
Uh-huh...

136
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,625
[CHICHI] My son!

137
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,833
Yep! That's me...!

138
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,125
Well, guys, this is going to be
your new home for a while.

139
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:25,125
It's not the Taj Mahal, but
I think you're gonna like it.

140
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,041
Hi! Are you the one
who helped Goku

141
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,125
save my beautiful little girl
from those horrible men?

142
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,208
You should get a medal!
You're a hero!

143
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,791
I... I, uh...

144
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,666
A ship!

145
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,500
She's a real beauty!

146
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,625
Advanced supertronics...
the best!

147
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,625
Self generating
laser powered reactor,

148
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,416
and a stereo system that
will bring the house down!

149
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,708
Not bad. Kakarot must've used
a ship just like this one.

150
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,041
[beep]

151
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,083
Hi, Vegeta. Come on out.
Cold drinks for everyone.

152
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,166
I made you a Shirley Temple.

153
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,208
[NARRATOR] And so began
a period of rest and recreation

154
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,625
for the visitors
from outerspace.

155
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,166
Moori became an expert putter.

156
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,833
[NARRATOR] The Namek boys
learned how to play poker.

157
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,750
[NARRATOR] And a certain frog
became the proud new ruler

158
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,333
of the fish pond.

159
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:26,833
[NARRATOR]
One hundred and thirty days

160
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,916
seemed to pass by very quickly,

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,958
and it was time to summon
the Eternal Dragon once again.

162
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:46,750
Gosh, are you guys ever lucky.

163
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,875
Our Dragon Balls take a
whole year to regenerate.

164
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,375
Ours too. We Nameks just have
shorter year than you all do.

165
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,833
Oh. Gotcha! Well,
what do you guys think?

166
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,916
I say we should we call
upon the Eternal Dragon

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,250
while we're still young.

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,750
Are you up to it?

169
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,750
Sure, why not?!
But... where's... Gohan?

170
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,541
[CHICHI]
Hey! Hold on! Wait for us!

171
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,750
Hey! What's up, kid?

172
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,041
[GOHAN] Not a lot!

173
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,041
Sorry we're late.
I had to finish my homework.

174
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,208
[BULMA] Don't sweat it, kid.

175
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,416
You're fashionably late
and that's okay.

176
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,750
Gohan's been hitting
the books a lot lately.

177
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,000
He's almost caught up
on all the work he missed

178
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,083
while he was gone.

179
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,916
Man! What a
little champion! Cool!

180
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,250
Well, Dende? Whadda ya say?

181
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,708
Sure!

182
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:36,791
[speaking Namekian]

183
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:53,125

[PORUNGA growls]

187
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,250
Wow! Now that's a dragon!

188
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,916
Yes! Oh, my! Dear me!

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,041

[indistinct chatter]

191
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,375
[screams] It's a monster!

192
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,000
[ALL gasp]

193
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,125
Whoa! Look at
the size of that thing!

194
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,500
Not on my beat!

195
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,333
We're taking that overgrown
lizard downtown, bro!

196
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,541
Go ahead! I'll back ya up!

197
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,000
I have... no clue.

198
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,791
[MAN] This is Sky-Cam Six

199
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,500
with the five o'clock
traffic report!

200
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:22,833
I quit!

201
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,958
I don't get
paid enough for this!

202
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,250
[OFFICER]
Ladies and gentlemen!

203
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,500
We have traced the origin
of the appararition

204
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,500
to the Capsule Corporation!

205
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,250
Go home. There is
no need to panic.

206
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,541
Aw, man!

207
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,083
[OFFICER] It's just
another one of Dr. Brief's

208
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,166
crazy experiments!

209
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,375
[indistinct chatter]

210
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,541
You who have summoned me.

211
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:48,666
I will now grant
you three wishes.

212
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,500
Now, proceed with your wishes.

213
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,083
Go ahead, my friends.

214
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,041
We can wait another
hundred and thirty days

215
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,458
to start our new life.

216
00:12:57,541 --> 00:13:00,166
Besides, I think I can
improve my putt.

217
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,750
It's all in the wrist.
And the follow-through.

218
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, shoot! Let's do it then!

219
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:09,750
Please bring Goku and Krillin
to Earth's Check-in Station

220
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,375
in the spirit realm.

221
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,541
[DENDE speaking Namekian]

222
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,291
All right. Just a sec.

223
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,625
[PORUNGA]
The one called Krillin

224
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,250
is at the Earth's
Check-in Station.

225
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,958
--[GOHAN and BULMA sigh]
--[DR. BRIEF] Ah!

226
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,583
But the one called Goku

227
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,166
cannot be brought
to that place.

228
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,833
What? Darn! What's up?!

229
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:41,958
Why not?

230
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,541
Because he is alive.

231
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,500
If I moved him there now,
he would die.

232
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,708
[CHICHI gasps]

233
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:54,791
[GOHAN] Dad's really
still alive? But how?

234
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,833
[VEGETA] Kakarot...

235
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,708
What? Goku? Alive? Huh?

236
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,416
--[PUAR laughs, cheers]
--[OOLONG] Hey! Yeah! Ha-ha!

237
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,583
Yay! [laughs]

238
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,083
[GOHAN laughs]

239
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,125
Hey, if Goku's alive, why
hasn't he come back yet? Huh?

240
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,250
[GOHAN] Well, maybe his
ship's broken!

241
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,791
Yeah, I'll bet he's stuck!

242
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,708
My friends! Look!
He's alive, right?

243
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,250
So, just wish him back here.

244
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,208
Hey! Great idea!

245
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,166
Yeah!

246
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,333
[laughs]
Now, the next wish!

247
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,750
Let's bring Krillin
back to life!

[speaking Namekian]

250
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,125
Huh? What? How?

251
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,041
Welcome back, partner!

252
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,250
[KRILLING] Oh, wow!
Wait a minute...

253
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,916
I'm back alive!

Hey! Yo, people!

257
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:07,083
Let's move it! One more wish!

258
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,833
Oooo! Sorry!

259
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,291
You're cute! I like you!

260
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,833
--[BULMA giggles]
--[PORUNGA] Oh...

261
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,416
Uh...

262
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,625
[BULMA] All right, then.
Let's do it.

263
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,750
For the last wish,
let's bring Goku back to Earth!

264
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:21,833
[cheering, lauhging]

265

268
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,750
Goku...!

[BOTH laugh]

270
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,833
[PORUNGA] Silence!
It can't be done!

271
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,291
Oh...

272
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,750
[PORUNGA] The one called Goku
refuses to return

273
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:59,541
and says he'll come back later.

274
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,125
What? But, why?

275
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,416
[ROSHI] I know why.

276
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,458
Because he's scared,
that's why!

277
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:10,375
Of the one more powerful
than a Super Saiyan; his wife!

278
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,291
[CHICHI] What?!

279
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:16,375
Yikes! No! Please, no!
It was a joke!

280
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:19,958
Gosh, why doesn't
Dad wanna come back?

281
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,333
[PICCOLO] Your dad told Porunga
that he'll be back later.

282
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,416
Don't worry, Gohan.
He'll keep his word.

283
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,333
[VEGETA] Kakarot!
What are you up to?

284
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,583
You're probably training
on another planet somewhere

285
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,291
perfecting your skills!

286
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,750
While I'm sitting here wasting
my time with these bozos!

[distant rumbling]

289
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:43,958
Huh?

290
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,958
[ALL gasp]

291
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,666
[MRS. BRIEF] Isn't that
your spaceship, darling?

292
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,375
[DR. BRIEF] Well, it was...!

293
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,208
Ohh...

294
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:02,541
[PICCOLO] Forget about him!

295
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,583
He's gone! No big loss!

296
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,583
Don't you guys have
some friends at King Kai's

297
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,333
that want to come back?

298
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,500
[BULMA] Oh, yeah!
Three of them.

299
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,416
But who should we
wish back first?

300
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,041
[KING KAI] Hey guys!

301
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,916
They want to
wish one of you back,

302
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but you have to choose.

303
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,208
Chiaotzu?

304
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,208
I think I'll stay here
and train some more.

305
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,208
You guys can pick.

306
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:27,291
Well, if he's staying,
I'm staying, too!

307
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,166
Very well then.
Yamcha, you're up!

308
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,375
[chatters]

309
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,708
Where's bubbles? He's gone!

310
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,416
Well... the hand
is quicker than the eye!

311
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,000
He knows better than that!

312
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,666
[KING KAI]
Bulma, can you hear me?

313
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,291
This is King Kai speaking.

314
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,333
Oh! Gosh, hi, King Kai!

315
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,291
[KING KAI] Bulma,
I asked all the guys

316
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,166
to decide which one
of them would go back first

317
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,083
and they chose Yamcha.

318
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,208
Yamcha, huh? Okay.

319
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,083
He probably
drew the short straw.

320
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:58,458
I'll bet he cheated.

321
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey, Dende. Yamcha's our man.

322
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,416

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,833
[PORUNGA growls]

324
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,833
So be it.

325
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,541
[PORUNGA] It is done.
Your wish has been granted.

326
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,708
It has? But where is he?

327
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,375
[PORUNGA] I have
fulfilled three wishes.

328
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,333
I am finished here.

329
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,583
Uh, no! Wait! Please!

330
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,208
[growls]

331
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh man! Bummer...!

332
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,958
The Dragon short-changed us!

333
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,625
No he didn't! I'm over here!

334
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,625
[chuckles nervously]

335
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,500
Ribbit, ribbit!

336
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,958
Yamcha! I missed you!

337
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,500
[laughs]

338
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,375
Puar, easy!

339
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:13,541
[PUAR]
You're really back!

340
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,083
[BULMA] Yamcha...?

341
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,708
Hey! Wow! You're looking
better than ever, Bulma!

342
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,541
I missed you a lot!

343
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,416
[NARRATOR] One hundred
and thirty days later,

344
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,166
on a sunny afternoon,

345
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,333
a peculiar darkness
overtook the sky once again!

346
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,458
The first wish was
used to bring back

347
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,958
the young Emperor, Chiaotzu.

348
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,208
[cheering and laughing]

349
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:51,041
[NARRATOR] With the next wish,
Tien was brought back.

350
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,500
Huh?

351
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,666
Are we, uh...?

352
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,125
Mm.

353
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:07,208
[CHIAOTZU] Oh, Tien! I can't
believe it! We're home!

354
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,208
[sobbing]

355
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,708
[clapping and cheering]

356
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,291
[growls]

357
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,333
[giggles]

358
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,958
Well, Dende...

359
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,125
It's time to say good-bye.

360
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,708
[DENDE] Yes, sir.

361
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:27,708
Good-bye, friends.
We love each of you.

362
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,458
Gosh! You're so sweet.

363
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,916
Gohan. I'm sorry, but I
have to say good-bye now.

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,708
Gosh, Dende.

365
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,791
I promise, I'll never
forget you, Gohan.

366
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,375
All right.
Let's have it already.

367
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,625
[DENDE speaking Namekian]

368
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,750
See ya!

369
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,041
Yeah, see ya!

370
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,958
Gohan...

371
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,666
Bye!

372
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,916
Dende!

373
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,041
[NARRATOR]
And so the star-voyagers

374
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,416
from the planet Namek
left the Earth

375
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
to begin life a new
somewhere deep in space!

376
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,083
[OX-KING] ChiChi, is that
meat loaf I smell?

377
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,958
[CHICHI] Yes, Dad.
It's meat loaf.

378
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,125
Mmm! Yummy! I love meat loaf!

379
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,708
[PICCOLO] If you ever
need me, Gohan...

380
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll be there for you, kid.

381
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:43,791
[NARRATOR] At long last,
life returned to normal

382
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,708
for Gohan and his family.

383
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:47,458
Except that every night,

384
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,375
they would go out and
look at the stars together,

385
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:54,791
and wonder when the one they
loved would finally return!
