00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,458
Majin Buu reached an all new
level of maliciousness.

3
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:21,208
He had already absorbed
Gotenks and Piccolo,

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,041
taking their power and wisdom

5
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,666
and transforming
into a mighty villain.

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,166
But when he sucked
up Gohan as well,

7
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,708
it gave him a virtually
unstoppable edge!

8
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:35,041
Goku planned to fuse with
Gohan using the Kai's Earrings,

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,208
and so had to watch

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:40,000
his best chance at
victory be taken, too.

11
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,708
And then came another.

12
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,875
[GOKU]
Vegeta!

13
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,916
All right! It's you! I knew it!

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] Thanks to
King Yemma's intervention,

15
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,083
Vegeta was back
from the Other World.

16
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,125
Immediately, Goku
tried persuading him

17
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,125
to join in a permanent fusion.

18
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,125
But Vegeta bore just
as much resentment

19
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,166
toward his old Saiyan
rival as ever,

20
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,833
and firmly refused.

21
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,125
[GOKU]
Everyone is gone!

22
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:07,791
[NARRATOR]
But in a passionate speech,

23
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:11,791
Goku asked Vegeta to lay down
their troubled Saiyan history

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,416
and look towards
a future on Earth.

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
And a bold decision was made.

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,583
[VEGETA]
Here, give it to me!

27
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,875
You bet!

28
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,166
To the end of the Earth!

29
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,291
All right! It's on!

30
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,750
Great! Thanks, Vegeta!

31
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,083
[NARRATOR]
And so, the last living Saiyans,

32
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,750
whose bitter rivalry has
stretched over a decade,

33
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,125
have dropped their swords
and fused permanently

34
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,333
into a new warrior.

35
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,791
The great battle begins.

36
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,041
Would you look at me?
I'm setting records.

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,708
He's dropped his guard! Great!

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,250
[gasps]

39
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
[VEGITO chuckles]

40
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:39,500
[VEGITO] Sorry about that.
Did I catch you by surprise?

41
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,791
What do you call a
Vegeta and a Goku?

42
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,500
Vegito sounds all right!

43
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,750
I was a little worried about
the two of us sharing a body,

44
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,625
but it looks like it
came out pretty good.

45
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,333
I guess I can live with this.

46
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,333
Those two I fought before
were starting to bore me.

47
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,750
Maybe now, I'll have
some decent competition.

48
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:13,500
[growls]

49
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,375
[chuckles]

50
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,000
Yoo-hoo!

51
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,333
[growls]

52
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,333
Cut that out!

53
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,041
[SUPER BUU yells]

54
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:27,750
[VEGITO yells]

55
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,958
[SUPER BUU groans]

56
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,750
[SUPER BUU grunts]

57
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:51,458
[yells]

58
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,666
[SUPER BUU cackles]

59
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,541
[chuckles]

60
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,125
[growls]

61
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:15,250
Thanks a lot!
That was a good warm up!

62
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,250
Nice bravado!

63
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:25,083
I bet you won't talk so tough
once I get my hands on you!

64
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,166
--[SUPER BUU cackles]
--[VEGITO yelps]

65
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:41,000
What a shame, dropping like
a fly, and I'm not even trying.

66
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,750
Ha...

67
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,250
Nice shot! That one really
got the blood flowing.

68
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,750
Can you throw me another?

69
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,125
Sorry about this,
but the body's rather new.

70
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,625
I'm sure you understand.

71
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,291
You've been stealing
people's bodies all day!

72
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,833
[SUPER BUU] The only thing
this two-man fusion has done

73
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,708
is make you twice
as foolish as before!

74
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,000
Funny, you think
that up yourself?

75
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:31,541
[grunts]

76
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,625
[gasps]

77
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,750
[SUPER BUU groans]

78
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,958
[SUPER BUU gasping, groaning]

79
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:07,375
[SUPER BUU] Curse you!
What have you done to me?!

80
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,375
[VEGITO] Pull yourself together,
would ya? It's humiliating.

81
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:16,166
[gasping]

82
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,166
[SUPER BUU cackles]

83
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,333
Now, that's more like it.

84
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,375
[MR. SATAN]
It's okay, Bee. I got ya!

85
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,416
[MR. SATAN] Let's just
hope this guy's got me!

86
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,208
Hey, buddy, uh, where
exactly are we goin'?

87
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,666
[DENDE]
Please, just be patient.

88
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,583
What? Where is that
rumblin' noise comin' from?

89
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,083
That's the sound of Goku
fighting with Majin Buu!

90
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:00,750
Yikes! We're not goin' over
there, are we? Say we're not!

91
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:04,166
[DENDE] We have to!
Goku might need our help!

92
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,416
Impressive.

93
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,083
So it's true that
you can do more

94
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,333
than just talk trash, after all.

95
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:37,208
Trash talk, huh?
Interesting phrase.

96
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:40,000
Must've picked that up
from my sons you stole!

97
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,791
[SUPER BUU] I don't know what
you're trying to suggest.

98
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,166
There's no shame in taking what
you need to hold your position.

99
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,208
I'm the terror of the universe!

100
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,666
[VEGITO] That's old news.
And, just like you,

101
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,625
it's about to be replaced!

102
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,791
[KIBITO KAI] Look at them!
They're extraordinary!

103
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,666
Despite all the power
Majin Buu has gained

104
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,291
from the other fighters,
they still fight evenly!

105
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,000
Evenly, you say?
Come, young Kai!

106
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,375
Which crystal ball have
you been looking through?

107
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,458
Huh?

108
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,916
Open your eyeballs,
and look closer!

109
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:42,041
I see! Majin Buu is
actually at a disadvantage!

110
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:45,458
In fact, that monster
can scarcely land a punch!

111
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,041
Oh! Our victory
is at last secured!

112
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,125
No, I'm afraid not!

113
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,791
[KIBITO KAI yelps]

114
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:55,166
There is the luck
of the moment, though!

115
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,041
Anything could happen
until this is through!

116
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,541
Honestly, I worry
about these Saiyans.

117
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,958
Seems their love of battle
might work against them.

118
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,083
But, if anyone is to defeat
Majin Buu, it will be them.

119
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,541
You can bet a nickel on that!

120
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,833
What's happening now, Elder?
I can't take the suspense!

121
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:16,333
[SUPER BUU groaning]

122
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,250
[grunts]

123
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:32,791
[SUPER BUU gasping]

124
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:38,083
Ugh! You fool!
You haven't beaten me yet!

125
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,416
[laughs, growls]

126
00:11:50,541 --> 00:12:02,291
[SUPER BUU grunting]

127
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,750
[yells]

128
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,416
[CHICHI] What's the word?
Is there any news?

129
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,833
Did you heard from him yet?

130
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,125
[BULMA] Sorry, Chichi, there's
no sign of him anywhere.

131
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,291
Videl, have you seen
or heard anything?

132
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:45,916
No, nothing. Nobody seems
to know where he is.

133
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,250
I have searched many
places. But nothing!

134
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,083
Oh, I can't stand this!

135
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,916
Obviously, Gohan
must be somewhere!

136
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,458
[gasps]

137
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,125
Oh! You don't think
he was sent down below

138
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,791
with all of the
bad people, do you?!

139
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,458
Don't even think it, ChiChi!

140
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,625
Of all the nice guys in
the world, Gohan is--

141
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,958
[DABURA]
Videl is right!

142
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,083
Your boy has a
heart of fine gold!

143
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,625
I know he's around
here somewhere!

144
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,000
[BULMA giggles]

145
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,125
Huh?

146
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,416
Well! You certainly
have pulled a 180

147
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,541
since you came up here, Dabura!

148
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,000
If someone told me now you
were Babidi's right hand man

149
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,375
and the king of demons,
I'd crack up!

150
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,666
Thank you, Bulma.

151
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,208
There was a time when
evil filled my heart

152
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,041
and all I wanted to do
was control the universe.

153
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,416
But Majin Buu revealed
to me my folly.

154
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,958
And I intend to prove now

155
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,750
my heart is filled with
nothing but love.

156
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,250
Uh, that's so good to know.

157
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,458
Uh... Yeah, anyway, I'm sure
that Gohan is gonna show up

158
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,666
really soon, ChiChi!

159
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,791
After all, it's a
really big place.

160
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,750
To try and find one person among
a hundred trillion people

161
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,250
isn't exactly an afternoon job!
It's gonna take a little time!

162
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,125
But we're all in this together.

163
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:00,041
So, we'll split into groups

164
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,083
and report back
every hour on the hour

165
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,083
until we find him, okay?

166
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,166
That's right.

167
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,791
And we promise,
we won't stop looking

168
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,500
until Gohan is safely
back in your arms again!

169
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,333
You mean it? Thanks a lot, guys.

170
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,375
Ah! This is a cruel,
cruel world!

171
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,583
I don't want you to
give up hope, my dear.

172
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,958
No matter what it takes,

173
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,000
I will make sure they
bring your boy back to you!

174
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,916
It's the least I can do.

175
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:36,500

[VEGITO grunts]

178
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,416
You wouldn't? Dumb question.

179
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,041
Yes, isn't it, though?

180
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,333
Every time I have
destroyed a planet,

181
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,000
I have taken a piece
of its energy with me.

182
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,958
This orb is the culmination
of eons of destruction!

[SUPER BUU]
We're going to play catch!

185
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,000
If this falls to the ground,
you can say goodbye

186
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,708
to this planet as well!

187
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,875
Are you up for the challenge?

188
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,291
It's all in your hands now.
Don't drop the ball!

189
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,875
[laughs]

190
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,083
I'm gonna set you
down right here!

191
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,458
Uh, but--

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,250
Shh!

196
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,833
Please be quiet, Mr. Satan!
Or else Majin Buu will find us!

197
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:06,166
[MR. SATAN groans]

198
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,958
Oh, wow!

199
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,666
W-Who is that person?

200
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,708
He kinda looks like that
Goku guy, but different!

201
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,791
Yes, that's Goku, all right!

202
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,750
Except that...! Yes, I thought
I sensed Vegeta's energy!

203
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,833
And so, there's still hope!

204
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,791
Huh? What'd you mean by that?

205
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,250
I mean, with those
two fused together,

206
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,166
the Earth has a very
good chance of survival!

207
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,541
[laughs]

208
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:02,583
Two, right!

209
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,000
[MR. SATAN chuckles]
So strange...

210
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,583
Huh? Wait!

211
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,166
Come back here, Bee!

212
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,625
[BEE yipping]

213
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,125
You shouldn't be goin' off
on your own like that, boy!

[gasps]

217
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:52,166
How did Buu create such
a giant energy ball?

218
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,416
He could split the Earth
in two with that power!

219
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,583
[cackles]

220
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:03,208
So, are you ready to play?

221
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,458
Ready? That all depends
on what you mean.

222
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:12,166
If you mean, am I superior
to you in every way, then yes!

223
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,750
What's that?

224
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,208
I'm ready! Go for it!

225
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,083
I'll make you a wager.
You see this spot?

226
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,000
I won't move from it!

227
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,208
You're awful confident
for someone so small.

228
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,583
But if that's the way you
want to play this, then fine!

[gasps]

244
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,250
I dare say you've been
toying with me all along!

245
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,583
If you could have sent that
energy ball into space,

246
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,208
you could've inflicted much
more damage to me earlier.

247
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:56,708
But you still don't compare.
No one compares to me!

248
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:03,750
You're wrong, Buu.
I'm destined to destroy you.

249

[yells]

250
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,208
I'm kinda stuck here, pal!
Can you lend a hand?

00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:27,166
[yelling continues]

252
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,083

[NARRATOR] Could this be
the beginning of the end

for Majin Buu?

258
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:45,833
The combined powers
of Goku and Vegeta

259
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,000
have proven to be
nearly unlimited.

260
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,666
But now, as a fused
Super Saiyan,

261
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,708
will they be able to
deliver the final blow?
