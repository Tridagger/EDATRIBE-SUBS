00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,375
Goku and Pikkon fired up

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:20,500
as the final bout of the Other
World Tournament began.

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
[NARRATOR] The mighty warriors
cut right to the chase,

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,416
quickly tagging one another
with heat-seeking energy blasts!

6
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,416
[NARRATOR] And
narrowly escaped...

7
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,916
[NARRATOR] Back on the ground,

8
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,833
the two locked arms for an
electrifying test of strength.

9
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,708
[NARRATOR] And to
Pikkon's great surprise,

10
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,500
Goku was able to
take the lead

11
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,791
pushing Pikkon just
inches away from defeat.

12
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,375
[NARRATOR] But the true
struggle had not yet begun.

13
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,708
[PIKKON yells]

14
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,166
[GOKU yells]

15
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,666
[NARRATOR] Without a word,
Pikkon removed his outer robes,

16
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,250
revealing that he'd been wearing
weighted training clothes

17
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,416
all along. And with the
heavy burden now removed,

18
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,250
his strength would
dramatically increase.

19
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,708
[NARRATOR] But of course,

20
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,958
Goku had been doing a little
holding back of his own.

21
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:44,333
[GOKU yells]

22
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,166
[NARRATOR] The second
half is kicking off...

23
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
and Goku is a Super Saiyan!

24
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:08,000
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

25
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,750
[PIKKON gasps]

26
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,625
[PIKKON thinking] What is he?

27
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,291
I've never seen such
a transformation...

28
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:36,666
[CROWD gasping]

29
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,875
[GRAND KAI laughs]

30
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,958
Well! This is unexpected!

31
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,541
The rookie fighter Goku
has just changed

32
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,333
into some sort of
shining golden thing!

33
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:48,250
[SOUTH KAI] Buh...?

34
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,500
Shiny gold thing?

35
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:54,041
Maybe it's a disease!
He could be contagious!

36
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,916
[KING KAI giggles]

37
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,375
Oh, it's nothing.

38
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:02,625
He just transformed
into a Super Saiyan.

39
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,166
Super...?

40
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,583
What's that mean?

41
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,083
Not much.

42
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:12,291
Just that his speed,
strength and ability

43
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,916
have become several
times more sensational

44
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
than before!

45
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,458
There's... no way!

46
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:22,958
Oh, but I'm afraid
there is, West Kai!

47
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,291
And by our bet, your home
planet will soon be mine!

48
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,875
You just wait!

49
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:33,250
Because Pikkon hasn't used
his full power yet either!

50
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,666
[thunder crashes]

51
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,416
The entire sky itself
seems to be shaking

52
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,208
from their awesome power!

53
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,500
This bout is gonna be insane!

54
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:55,375
Heh!

55
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,541
I might as well start it big.

56
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,708
Ka--Me--Ha--Me...

57
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,500
Haaaa!

58
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,666
Got you!

Look above you...

68
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:50,916
Huh?!

[thinking] Darn it!

70
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,291
I just couldn't
keep up with him!

71
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,458
[PIKKON] Your power
is impressive...

72
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,583
But you'll need
more concentration

73
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,916
if you want to follow me.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,125
Hmph.

75
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:16,000
You've disappointed me, Goku.

my piddling fighters

couldn't stand up against
those powerful guys...

I did make that
little promise, didn't I?

I was hoping they
wouldn't remember.

137

I've never fought someone quite
as powerful as you are.

138

It's because you're strong.

be exciting then

get much tougher!

189

What's happening up there?
I've lost track of them.

190
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,958
Me too...

191
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,583
Both fighters have
moved out of our sight...

192
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:27,333
Who knows what kind of crazy
moves are going on up there?

193
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:32,333
Who is winning? Who is losing?
Who is blowing up stuff?!

194
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,833
It seems these are things none
of us can ever know...

Hmph.

[GOKU growls]

205
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,500

catch him off guard!

Ugh... You... got... me...

209
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,125
And I'll finish you!

210
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,666
Using the special attack
you seem so fond of...

211

215
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,500
[thinking] This is it, Goku!
This is your chance!

216
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,333
His attack has got to
have a weak point!

Aaaaa--

221
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,166
[GOKU] There!

222

--ttack!

[FIGHTER] A... A...
A... A-Astonishing...

231
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,125
[MUSHROOM MC] Uhh...

232
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:27,166
Oh, uh, Pikkon has landed
outside of the ring!

233
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,625
And that means
Goku is the winner!

234
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,708
And champion of the
Other World Tournament!

235
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:39,208

[PIKKON grunts]

238
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,083
Huh...?

239
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,083
[PIKKON chuckles]

240
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,041
[PIKKON] You got me...

241
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:56,000
[GOKU] Well, Pikkon,
it was a mistake to use

242
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,291
your Thunder Flash
move a third time.

243
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,833
By then I had seen
the attack enough times

244
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,708
to find a weakness in it!

245
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,083
Huh?

246
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,208
[PIKKON chuckles]

247
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,750
I see...

248
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:10,791
Truly, you're a great fighter.
Enjoy your private lesson...

249
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,125
[PIKKON] I'll keep
training and beat you

250
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,958
at the very next chance.

251
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,833
Great! Hey, thanks for
fighting with me.

252
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,500
Goku's the champ! I am his King!

253
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,666
That... means... I... win!

254
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,166
And! That, of course,
means I get your planet!

255
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,166
Please! No talking!

256
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,625
Now... Goku if you could
come over here for a minute

257
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,541
we can give you
your official prize!

258
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,125
[GRAND KAI] Minor problem!

259
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:45,625
[BOTH] Huh?

260
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,583
[GRAND KAI] Both Goku and
Pikkon have violated the rules

261
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,541
of the tournament,
and therefore...

262
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,458
Both fighters have
been disqualified!

263
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,000
Huh...?

264
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,375
[ALL] Huh?!

265
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,958
Yeah, that's right!

266
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,541
Goku, do you admit that you
and Pikkon touched the ceiling

267
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:05,416
of this here stadium
during the fight?

268
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,208
The ceiling?

269
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,666
Uhh...

270
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,291
Yeah, we did.

271
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:18,875
Well, according to Article 3,
Section 9, paragraph 1351

272
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:21,750
of the official rule book,
the stadium ceiling

273
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,000
is the same as the
stadium floor.

274
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,750
Because if you stand on your
head, the floor is the ceiling

275
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,250
and the ceiling is the floor!

276
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,416
Therefore, it's ring-out!.

277
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,208
Oh, but Grand Kai!

278
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:37,375
If he's disqualified that
means that nobody wins!

279
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,208
Homeless again!

280
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:41,750
--[KING KAI groans]
--Yes! What a wise judgement!

281
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,375
Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm!
Goku lost! I agree!

282
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,708
You're right...

283
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,500
We broke the rules so we lose.

284
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,333
But, your fight rocked!

285
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,333
So as a bonus,
I'll allow both you and Pikkon

286
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:58,708
to take my private lessons
in two to three hundred years!

287
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,708
Two hundred years...

288
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,500
Great! I'll be there!

289
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,166
[thinking] That'll
give me just enough time

290
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,041
to whip back into shape!

291
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,041
I've been too much of a
couch potato to keep up

292
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,958
with those boys now!

293
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,916
[NARRATOR] And so it
was in Other World...

294
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,958
Even after death,
Goku's fighting spirit

295
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,291
could not
be put to rest.

296
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,416
[NARRATOR] As the hero trained,
several years passed

297
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,208
in the living world, on the
humble blue planet called Earth.

298
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,541
[GOHAN] Heading out, Mom!

299
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,041
[CHICHI] Oh, wait a sec, Gohan!

300
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,375
Huh?

301
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,875
[CHICHI] Here. You'll
probably want your lunch!

302
00:21:53,958 --> 00:21:55,083
[GOHAN chuckles]

303
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,958
Oh... You're just
like your dad--

304
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,666
Always jumping the gun...

305
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,041
Thanks, Mom...

306
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,458
Now I'm off!

307
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,458
Well, remember to listen
to your teachers carefully, Son.

308
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,958
'Course!

309
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,166
Nimbus!

310
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,875
Have a wonderful
first day, Gohan!

311
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,541
[NARRATOR] Gohan
has become a teenager...

312
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,916
With no schools near
his mountain village,

313
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,500
he has done most of his
schooling at home,

314
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,666
finally free to study
like his mother wanted.

315
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,416
[NARRATOR] Gohan may have
ventured across the galaxy

316
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,875
and saved the Earth from
destruction,

317
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,291
but there's one great
challenge he has yet to face:

318
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,083
High School...
