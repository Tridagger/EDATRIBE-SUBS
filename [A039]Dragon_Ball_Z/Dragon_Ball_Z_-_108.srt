1
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:19,333
[MAN] Please, stay away from us.
We didn't do anything!

2
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,416
[WARRIOR 1]
We never said you did.

3
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,791
[slashing,
screaming]

4
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:38,458
[laughing]

5
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,041
[GARLIC JR.] Ah, in the
darkness they have taken wing,

6
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,333
never to return again...

7
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,500
[thunder cracks]

8
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,333
[thunder cracks]

9
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:02,125
[GARLIC JR.] Maybe these poor
fools know how I felt now.

10
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,916
When I was cast off
against my will into

11
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,125
a place from which
there was no escape.

12
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,916
[GARLIC JR.] Into the darkness.
Alone, in a frozen hell

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
without any light for years.

14
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,000
So many years...

15
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,750
Well I've come back to share.

16
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,083
To share the pain and
the horror that I felt

17
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,208
with every living
thing on Earth.

18
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,750
After ten years of exile
in the Dead Zone,

19
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,333
I, Garlic Jr., have
returned to Earth

20
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,291
to hatch a sinister plan of

21
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,458
destruction and revenge.

22
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,750
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

23
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,083
[GOHAN laughs]

24
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,750
[GOHAN] Come on!
Catch me if you can!

25
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,375
[GOHAN laughs]

26
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,291
[GOHAN] C'mon, faster!

27
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,583
[SABERTOOTH TIGER yells]

28
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,166
[GOHAN grunts]

29
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,500
Wow.

30
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:02,833
[KRILLIN] Hey, yo.

31
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey, Krillin.

32
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,416
Wow. Is that really
you under there?

33
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,416
Yeah, sweetheart. See?

34
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
That's the worst
Humphrey Bogart imitation

35
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,416
I've ever heard.

36
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,208
So whatcha been doing, partner?!

37
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,375
Ehh, not much.

38
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,500
[KRILLIN screams]

39
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,833
[GOHAN] It looks like we'll
be having fish for a while.

40
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,958
Hey, do you want to help
me gut and clean 'em?

41
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,375
Uh, no thanks.

42
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,875
Hey, come on.

43
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,375
Hey!

44
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,958
[GOHAN] Let's go for
a swim, then.

45
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,416
The water is ice-cold.
It feels really incredible.

46
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,458
No, please, no.

47
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,833
Huh?

48
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,791
Sorry. It's the threads, bro.

49
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,833
Ahh. Well, no big deal.
Take 'em off.

50
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,000
[KRILLIN] Uh, well, uhh...

51
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,625
Huh?

52
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,791
Oh, wow. Check out that car!

53
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,208
Is it yours?! For real?!

54
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,625
Yep. Well, uh, sort of.

55
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,000
Aw, what the heck.

56
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,166
It's been so long.

57
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,291
One little dip
won't hurt anything.

58
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,375
Ha-ha!

59
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,166
Last one in is a rotten egg.

60
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,458
[WOMAN] Krillin! Hey!

61
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,416
What are you doing?!

62
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,166
Are you coming, or what?

63
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,208
Yeah, sure! One sec!

64
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:23,000
Who is she? What's up?

65
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,208
Hmph!

66
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,833
[KRILLIN] She's my,
uh, well, she's uh...

67
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,416
[WOMAN] Krillin. You didn't
forget about me, did you?

68
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
Who me?

69
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,208
Yeah, you. Who's that?

70
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,666
Oh, this is my martial
arts partner, Gohan.

71
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,833
Gohan this is
my "friend", Maron.

72
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:41,250
Hi.

73
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,000
Is he from outer-space?

74
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,083
No, Maron, this isn't the one.

75
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,000
It's his dad, remember?

76
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,375
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

77
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,958
Well, he sure is cute,
though. Did you know that?

78
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,416
Well, sort of.

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,458
[MARON giggles]

80
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,541
[MARON] Modest, huh?
And look at this

81
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,833
beautiful black hair.

82
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,458
I know a lot of girls
that would kill

83
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,125
to have hair like this.

84
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,958
[MARON] Do you always hang
out in your underwear?

85
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,458
[MARON giggles]

86
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,875
How cute.

87
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,708
[KRILLIN yells]

88
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,833
Hey, easy! What's the deal?!

89
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,541
What's the deal with you?

90
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,000
You're not jealous, are you?

91
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,333
I thought he was your friend.

92
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:16,583
[KRILLIN stammers]

93
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,750
Yeah, well, he is.

94
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,791
You're so silly. Here.

95
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,208
[KRILLIN chuckles]

96
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,208
[MARON giggles]

97
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh. Uh... Hah...

98
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,166
Hey, Gohan, guess what?

99
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,166
What?

100
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,500
There's a party, bro.

101
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,250
Later on this afternoon
at Master Roshi's place.

102
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,583
Think you can make it?

103
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,791
Yeah, sure.

104
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,375
Well, that is, if my
mom'll let me go.

105
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,833
Oh, yeah. She's too darn strict

106
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,166
with all of that studying.

107
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,791
[GOHAN groans]

108
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,083
Oh, well. Maybe a
miracle will happen

109
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,250
and she'll say yes.

110
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,416
Stranger things have
happened, you know.

111
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,083
Yeah...

112
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,625
Ciao!

113
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,083
Laters.

114
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,833
[thinking] I wonder if she's...?

115
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,708
Bye!

116
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,500
[MARON giggles]

117
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,166
Yeah, she is! She's
Krillin's girlfriend!

118
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,166
He did it!

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,375
After all these years,

120
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,708
he finally found a girlfriend.

121
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,041
Boy, is Dad gonna be
surprised when he gets back.

122
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,875
[blows landing,
PICCOLO grunts]

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,958
[grunting continues]

125
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,458
[PICCOLO yells]

126
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,375
[KAMI] Thank goodness.
I was beginning to think

127
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,625
I needed glasses.

128
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:34,875
What? You. And what
are you doing here?

129
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,750
Thanks. Nice welcome.
Same Piccolo.

130
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,166
You're still rude, arrogant,

131
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,166
and completely lacking
in social graces.

132
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,791
But this is just the exterior;

133
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,791
the hard, protective,
outer-shell.

134
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,625
Inside, you've
changed a great deal,

135
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,833
which is why I have come
here to talk to you.

136
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,625
I was hoping that you
would ascend to the throne

137
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,125
and take over my position
as guardian of the Earth.

138
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,583
What...?

139
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,458
[PICCOLO yells]

140
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:14,208
I'm not interested
in your stinking job.

141
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:17,500
But... I have been a
little worried about you.

142
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:18,958
Huh?

143
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,958
[PICCOLO] I've seen
some disturbing

144
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:24,708
images in my meditation
lately, and, I'm not sure,

145
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,291
but I think they're
glimpses of the future.

146
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,833
There might be some
trouble brewing

147
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,833
so... just be careful,
that's all.

148
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,958
Piccolo...

149
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:42,541
[MR. POPO hums]

150
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,625
Huh?

151
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,375
Oh no...

152
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:48,708
[laughing]

153
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,166
[WARRIOR 2] Yoo-hoo.

[grunting]

157
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:11,791
[GARLIC JR.] Enough.

158
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,250
I said enough!

159
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,541
[MR. POPO gasps]

160
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,791
It's you. Garlic Jr.!

161
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:36,583
Very observant, Mr. Popo.

162
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
[MR. POPO] What do you want?

163
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,500
[GARLIC JR. snickers]

164
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,041
[snickering continues]

165
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,666
Yes, sure, I remember
it all clearly now.

166
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,875
Why you came before.

167
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,458
Now, Dragon! Arise!

168
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:07,625
[MR. POPO] You were
going to use

169
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,666
the legion of dark
spirits upon the Earth.

170
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,041
So first, you stole
the Dragon Balls

171
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,541
and used them to
wish for immortality.

172
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,208
[GARLIC JR. chuckles]

173
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:17,958
Huh...?

174
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:23,500
[GARLIC JR. screams]

175
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,458
[MR. POPO] Kami tried to
stop you, but he's getting old

176
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,583
and he's not as spry
as he used to be.

177
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,708
[MR. POPO] Try as he might,
he wasn't able to stop you,

178
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,625
and you finally overpowered him.

179
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,666

[KAMI grunts]

182
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,250
[MR. POPO] It was an
easy victory for you,

183
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,833
but when Goku and
Piccolo intervened,

184
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,666
you were forced to transform

185
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,041
and use your maximum power

186
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,708
to finally overcome them.

187
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,083
[MR. POPO] But there was one
thing you hadn't counted on:

188
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:04,333
Goku's son.

189
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,541
[GOHAN growls]

190
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:09,708
[GOHAN] Don't you hurt my
Daddy! Leave him alone!

191
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
[MR. POPO] Even though
he was just a boy,

192
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,083
he had phenomenal powers.

193
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,291
[GARLIC JR. growls]

194
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,083
You pest! How are
you doing this?!

195
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,291
[GOHAN growls]

196
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
[GARLIC JR. shouts]

197
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:23,916
[GOHAN grunts]

198
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,125
Into the void you go!

199
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,166
[GARLIC JR. growls]

200
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,666
[MR. POPO] He didn't
care about himself,

201
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,250
it was his love for his father

202
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,041
that awakened his
sleeping powers.

203
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,250
He couldn't stand
to see his father

204
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,041
sucked into the
horrible Dead Zone Vortex

205
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,583
that you created.

206
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,041
[GOHAN growls]

207
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,125
[MR. POPO] So he
exploded with rage

208
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,958
and his fantastic power bounced

209
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,625
you into that horrible prison

210
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,291
that you intended for others.

211
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,833
We thought you
were gone forever.

212
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,500
[GARLIC JR. yells]

213
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,875
[GARLIC JR.] Don't look so
disappointed, Mr. Popo.

214
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,833
Kami's getting
close to retirement.

215
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:09,000
He's going to need
a competent successor.

216
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,875
Whatd'ya think, Mr. Popo?

217
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,041
Do I fit the bill?

218
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,500
Am I not the ideal
candidate to be

219
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,041
the next guardian
of the Earth?

220
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,875
Please. Well? Tell me, Mr. Pop.

221
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,041
You can be honest.
Speak your mind.

222
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,583
Well, what's the matter?!

223
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,791
Tongue tied?! Rogue.
You don't think I'd be

224
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:27,416
good for the job, do you?!

225
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,208
[WARRIORS laugh]

226
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,666
[MR. POPO] Magic Carpet!

227
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,375
[GARLIC JR.] Get him!

228
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,125
--Right, Boss!
--Right, Boss!

[MR. POPO gasps]

231
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,750
I... can't budge...

232
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,875
[WARRIORS laugh]

233
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,791
[GARLIC JR.] Yes, this
is a very special net.

234
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:51,041
It paralyzes those
captured in it.

235
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,500
Ease up, boys.

236
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,875
[GARLIC JR.] Now, Popo.
Where is Kami?

237
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,166
[MR. POPO] I don't know.

238
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,666
[GARLIC JR.] You're lying!

239
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,458
No! Mr. Popo does not lie!

240
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:04,541
For some reason I believe you.

241
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:07,333
Yes, that's because I don't lie!

242
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,083
Bah. You disgust me!

243
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,541

[MR. POPO gasps]

245
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,250
Pint-sized Popo. Don't
bother trying to escape.

246
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,541
That tiny, little energy
field is impregnable.

247
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,083
[GARLIC JR.] Ahh, there you are.

248
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:28,500
You look so scared.

249
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,458
Don't worry, I'm not going
to kill you yet, Mr. Popo.

250
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,500
All in due time.
All in due time!

[GARLIC JR. laughs]

252
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,250
What a day. This is great!

253
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,458
All of us here together!

254
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,875
Really. Hey,
speaking of together,

255
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,666
are you guys officially dating?

256
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,250
Uh-huh! Well, sort of. We're
not boyfriend and girlfriend.

257
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,875
Huh? Oh, so we're still
free to date other people?

258
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,875
Well, then, what d'ya
say we go out?

259
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,666
Uh? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not?

261
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,875
Say what?!

262
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,500
My goodness!

263
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,875
Come on, Bulma.

264
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,875
We were joking. Right?
Tell her, Maron.

265
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,458
No, I'm serious.

266
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,666
Oh, no..

267
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,041
[BULMA] Enough kidding around!

268
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,458
Maron you haven't said
much about Krillin.

269
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,125
What's makes him
so special to you?

270
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,291
Gosh, that's a good one...

271

Uhh...

278
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,375
Something needs to be
done about this...

We need to talk, son.

Why so serious? What's the deal?

283
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,500
[ROSHI] Krillin, I'm your
Master and teacher

284
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,583
and you know full well
that you're not allowed

285
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,875
to have a girlfriend unless
I approve of her first.

286
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,375
Yeah, but it all
happened so fast.

287

Cut him some slack!

Sorry, I can't. I have to
do what's best for Krillin!

290
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,875
Sure, no prob. So I have to
pass some sort of test, huh?

291
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,291
I'm positive that I can
win your approval, sir!

292
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,666
Good. I'm glad. Maybe you can.

00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,500
And here's what
I want you to do...

295
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,958
What is it?

296
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,666
Spill it.

297
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,458
Yeah, tell me!

298
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,666
Just give me a
little kiss, baby!

299
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,541

302
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,875
Go away.

303
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,958

[GOHAN] Please, Mom?

306
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,833
[CHICHI] No, Gohan.
I already told you. No.

307
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,500
But why...?

308
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,000
[CHICHI] Because you need
to study, that's why.

309
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,916
Mmm, that's not bad...

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,833
Mom, just this once.

311
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,666
Gohan, you know how
important your studies are.

You don't want to fail
and blow your chances

someday, do you?

No...

315
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,041
Then be a good boy
and do as I say.

What happened here?!

you are! I see you...

Impossible!

[GARLIC JR.] Don't have a
heart attack, old man.

324

I don't want you
to die before I have

325
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,458
the pleasure of killing you!

326
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,250
[KAMI] You're even more
arrogant than before.

327
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,958

you would destroy

is it of yours, Kami?

330
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,583
This is my sanctuary now.

hear me. Mr. Popo?

[MR. POPO] Sorry, Kami!

335
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,208
[GARLIC JR.] As new
guardian of the Earth,

336
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,666
the first change I'm making
is to hire a groundskeeper

337
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,875
who's actually tall enough
to water the plants.

338
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,875
Why, you fiend! You'll
never get away with this!

339
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,458
Your dark plans have no
firm foundation to stand on!

340
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,666
They're going to crumble.
You can't succeed!

341
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
Yes I can.

342
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,250
You were lucky last time.
If it wasn't for that kid,

343
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,875
I'd be sitting on your
throne already.

344
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,500
In your dreams. I'll die
before I let that happen!

00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,666
Oh my, I couldn't have
said it any better myself.

347
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,833
I'm taking over,
and you are going to die!

That way we can use
the Dragon Balls.

358
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,583
What? Oh, no!

359
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,000
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

360
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,875
You are a sight to behold.

361
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,666
You have no idea how much
I'm loving this, old man.

362
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,916
Fool! You won't succeed!

363
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,833
My, my, those are
awfully big words

364
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,333
from such a tiny little man.
You're too much.

365
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,875
Don't you get it, you
feeble, joke of a guardian?

366
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,916
Your time has come.

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,875
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

368
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,041
[CHICHI hums]

369
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:28,208
Gosh, I'm sorry,
Mom. Man, I'm bad.

370
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,083
Thanks. Being bad's not easy.

371
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,750
Well, let's blaze.
What d'ya say?

372
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,500
[growls]

373
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,958
Shh.

374
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,208
[GOHAN laughs]

375
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:46,083
Whoa. Look at that
sunset, Icarus!

376
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,875
[door creaks open]

377
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,916
[GARLIC JR.] Now where would
that green goody-two-shoes

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,083
hide my father's
Black Water Mist?

379
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,583
Hmm? Wouldn't you know it.

380
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,833
That dodo left it
right here in the open.

381
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,833
Ah, yes, this is it, all right.

382
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:03,458
With this, we don't need
an army. We'll make one.

383
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:05,416
What d'ya mean, Boss?

384
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,250
[GARLIC JR. grunts]

385
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,708
[GARLIC JR.] When people
breath this mist,

386
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,833
any evil tendencies
that they're resisting

387
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,750
take control of
their character.

388
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,166
They become mad with desire for
wealth and material pleasure

389
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,041
to the point of wanting to
kill each other for it.

390
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,250
You see, boys,
our army of darkness

391
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,291
has always been here.

392
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,708
We just have to wake it up.

393
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,500
You're a genius, Lord Garlic.
What a brilliant plan.

394
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:29,708
Yeah, you've really outdone
yourself this time, Boss.

395
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,083
Why, thank you.

396
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,458
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

397
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,458
[NARRATOR] With Kami and
Mr. Popo powerless to stop him,

398
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,166
Garlic Jr. has released
the Black Water Mist

399
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,541
onto the Earth.

400
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,541
As Gohan flies unsuspectingly
to meet his friends,

401
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,041
the evil mist descends.

402
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,166
What darkness does it portend?

403
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,916

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
