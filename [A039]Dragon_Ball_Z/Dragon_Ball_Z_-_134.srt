00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,708
The demented Dr. Gero
escaped to his

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,833
mountain hideout to
carry out the final phase

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,375
of his evil plan.

5
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,500
The doctor, now
an android himself,

6
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,375
activated two more of his
mechanical monsters.

7
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,916
The first to awaken was
17, a black haired boy

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,958
with super strength
and intelligence.

9
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,000
Next out was 18, a
computer driven diva

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,333
with blonde hair
and a bad attitude.

11
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,041
Don't let their looks fool you!

12
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,375
They may appear
harmless, but these two

13
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,833
are programmed to
pulverize planet earth!

14
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,458
And while Krillin
and the others force

15
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,125
their way into
the secret lab,

16
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,000
Dr. Gero's about
to find out that

17
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,250
his menacing machines
have minds of their own.

18
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:56,708
[DR. GERO] Huh? Android 17!
What are you doing?

19
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,041
Then let's try another idea.

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
[DR. GERO]
What?! What have you done?

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,625
You dare to defy me?
I created you!

22
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,458
You're not going to put us
to sleep again, old man.

23
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,750
Rats! It's sealed shut!

24
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,666
[VEGETA] Out of the way!
I'll blast it open!

25
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,083
[ALL]
Huh?

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,791
Don't do it! We can't beat
the androids without Goku!

27
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,875
Stop it! You don't understand
how powerful they are!

28
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,500
Too late, kid!

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,708
[PICCOLO, KRILLIN gasp]

30
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:51,583
[VEGITA]
Well, well...

31
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,250
What have we here that
has you all so nervous?

32
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,833
A boy with long hair and
a scarf around his neck,

33
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,833
and a beautiful young girl...

34
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,291
I take it these are
the scary Androids

35
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,083
we've heard so much about?

36
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,125
That's them.

37
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:09,250
They're androids? They look
just like humans to me!

38
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,375
[TRUNKS] Don't be fooled
by the way they look.

39
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,208
They're both deadly!

40
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,208
And they're stronger
than all of us!

41
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,916
[DR. GERO]
Well...

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,375
Goku's friends are very
determined to stop us...

43
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,625
But they will not!

44
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,125
[DR. GERO]
We will destroy them

45
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,208
just as they
destroyed Android 19!

46
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,458
Android 19?

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,333
So you built him after all!

48
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,208
[DR. GERO]
Yes!

49
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,791
[ANDROID 17]
I see.

50
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,833
But he was of a different
design than 18 or myself.

51
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:42,000
He was an energy-absorbing
model, was he not?

52
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:44,000
[DR. GERO]
Yes, he was.

53
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,833
How very interesting.

54
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:49,041
And you've chosen that
same design for yourself?

55
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,666
You thought that an
energy-absorbing model like 19

56
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,583
would be easier to control?

57
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:54,416
Yes!

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,333
And now he's been destroyed!

59
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:58,666
[DR. GERO growls]

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,208
What are they up to?

[TIEN grunts]

62
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,833
[DR. GERO] That is enough
questions for now.

63
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,375
I order you to destroy
these intruders!

64
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,375
[ANDROID 17]
Be quiet old man!

65
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,833
We will deal with them
when we are ready.

66
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,791
What did you say?

67
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,708
[ANDROID 17 chuckles]

68
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:22,500
[DR. GERO growling]

69
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:26,125
[DR. GERO] I really wish you
had not smashed the controller!

70
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,833
Ha!

71
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:33,000
[ANDROID 18]
Yes, that's too bad, isn't it?

72
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,333
[ANDROID 18] Planning to
use it for spare parts?

73
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,333
[DR. GERO]
Huh?

74
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,541
[ANDROID 18]
He's kind of lacking

75
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,916
in the looks
department, isn't he?

76
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,791
I'd like to see what
other modifications

77
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,875
you've made to him, Doctor!

78
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:54,125
[DR. GERO] You stay away from
there! Do not open that chamber!

79
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,875
I order you to stay
away from Android 16!

80
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,791
[TRUNKS] 16?! There's another
android I didn't know about?

81
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:07,166
Go on. I think it is time to
wake up our sleeping friend.

82
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,333
[ANDROID 18]
Right!

83
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,416
[DR. GERO]
No! Do not listen to him!

84
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,958
I have not completed
his programming yet!

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,166
What?

86
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,750
Something's not right, in there!

87
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,833
You got that right!

88
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,666
[KRILLIN] Guys! Now would
be a good time to attack!

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,083
Before they get
their act together!

90
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,000
Step aside! I don't need your
help to defeat these three!

91
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:33,541
[DR. GERO]
I must get control of them!

92
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,750
The 16 is just a prototype.

93
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:39,416
If you activate it,
it may malfunction.

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,541
[ANDROID 17 laughs]
Let's find out!

95
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,083
No, 18!

96
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,666
I think it's time to send
you to the scrap heap!

97
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,583
[DR. GERO groans]

98
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:57,208
[ANDROID 18]
Now, where was I?

99
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,666
[DR. GERO growls]

100
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,791
[ANDROID 18]
If 16 is just a prototype,

101
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,666
I wonder why you've
kept him for so long?

102
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,458
You destroyed all the other
androids up to 15, didn't you?

103
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:11,333
[DR. GERO] I was planning
to repair him someday!

104
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,291
Listen, I made you,

105
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,500
and I am telling you that if you
activate 16, you will regret it!

106
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,875
We will regret it?

107
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:21,500
I doubt that, old man.

108
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,958
[DR. GERO]
Huh?

109
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,583
According to this data,

110
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,125
I am much stronger
than this model is!

111
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,500
It makes no difference!

112
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,375
Hm. 18, go ahead
and activate him. Now.

113
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,833
I am your creator! You will
do as I tell you to do!

114
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,625
[DR. GERO] Stop meddling
with Android 16 now!

115
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,125
Or I will force you to stop.

117

brave for someone all alone!

342
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,708
Don't worry. I came prepared!

343
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,041
[VEGETA laughs]

344
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,958
[VEGETA] I'm going to put
you back in the crates

345
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,666
you crawled out of!

346
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,666
[BOTH chuckle]

347
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,291
You're laughing? Why is
that? This is not a joke!

348
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,125
Tell me, are all
of you Saiyans so

349
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:31,625
full of yourselves?
Is Goku like you?

350
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,708
Is this the way you try
to hide your incompetence?

351
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:38,541
[ANDROID 17] We androids will
always be superior to your kind!

352
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,625
You take that back!
You'll regret saying that!

353
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,083
You're nothing but a
machine made of tin!

354
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:48,333
You're just a bunch of toys
made by a crazy old man!

355
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,500
And don't forget that
tin toys can be broken!

356
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,458
He talks too much.

357
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,750
What was that?

358
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,083
[ANDROID 18]
16! Let's see what you can do!

359
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,916
Destroy him!

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,333
I refuse.

361
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,916
[ANDROID 17 gasps]

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,333
So, the big guy's not so dumb,
huh? Now, who's it going to be?

363
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:11,500
[ANDROID 17]
He refuses?

364
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,250
Who does he think he is?

365
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,791
[ANDROID 18]
Never mind him.

366
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,833
I'll handle this.

367
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,708
Ready? Little man?

368
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,375
[VEGETA]
So, it's ladies first, is it?

369
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,833
That's fine with me!

370
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:31,583
Now, don't expect me
to go easy on you.

371
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,000
I fight to win!

372
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,125
[NARRATOR]
Android 18 looks like she's one

373
00:22:36,208 --> 00:22:38,125
tough customer, but
is she strong enough

374
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,625
to go one on one
with a Super Saiyan?

375
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,875
Whatever the outcome
Vegeta has got his

376
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,833
hands full with these
three bionic brutes.

377
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,041
Is he ready to battle
these mechanical monsters

378
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,541
all by himself?

379
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:54,791
