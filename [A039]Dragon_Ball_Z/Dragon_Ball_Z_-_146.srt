00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,125
[CELL] What a shame we won't
get to know each other today

182
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,583
[KRILLIN] Uh...?

183
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,083
Ah-ah-ah!

184
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,333
[PICCOLO growls]

185
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,041
Now we just missed him!

186
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,208
Krillin, are you alright?

187
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:08,666
What do you think?

188
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,708
[thinking] I just don't
understand it!

189
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,875
[CELL] Goku is still alive?

190
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,291
[KRILLIN] Yeah, of course he is!

191
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,291
[CELL] Goku's alive...

192
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:52,583
So, this history is somehow
different from the one I know.

193
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,125
[TRUNKS thinking]
Even Cell knew it!

194
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,916
The timeline in this world is
playing out very differently

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,541
from the one we
knew in the future.

196
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,375
Nothing is happening
as I expected it to!

197
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,958
And I can't figure
out what it was

198
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,291
that threw things
so far off course!

199
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,500
[FRIEZA growls]

200
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,791
When I get my hands on-- Huh?!

201
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,041
[TRUNKS yells]

202
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,791
[FRIEZA whimpers]

203
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,208
[TRUNKS yells]

204
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,791
[TRUNKS] My battle with Frieza
was three years ago now.

205
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:22,000
With the element of
surprise on my side

206
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,500
I defeated him and
his father easily.

207
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
But I knew it
wouldn't end there...

208
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,208
I came from the future to warn
Goku and his friends

209
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,083
of an even greater threat
that was on the way.

210
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,000
It was hard for them to believe,

211
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,791
but Frieza would be the
least of their problems.

212
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:41,291
[TRUNKS] Goku was unaware that
he would catch a deadly virus.

213
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,375
Of course,
how could he ever know?

214
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:46,625
But I felt that if I gave him
the antidote to save his life,

215
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,500
he would survive and be strong
enough to help me defeat

216
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,375
Dr. Gero's androids,

217
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,875
both in this world
and in my future world!

218
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,791
When I later came
back to this time,

219
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,250
I found that the
timeline I had expected

220
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,041
was slipping out of control.

221
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,583
Something had changed!

222
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,458
Goku was nowhere to be found.

223
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,291
Neither were the androids
that terrorized my world.

224
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:11,791
Instead, that strange Android 19
and the maniacal android version

225
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:15,041
of Dr. Gero had
appeared in their place!

226
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,958
[TRUNKS] At last,
Androids 17 and 18,

227
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,958
the androids I expected
to find did arrive.

228
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,791
But along with them came
yet another new android...

229
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,791
One that may be even more
terrible than the rest!

230
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,416
Why hadn't he been
activated in my time?

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,000
How many other evil schemes

232
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:35,916
had Dr. Gero planned of
which I was unaware?

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,750
I guess I learned the answer to
that question soon enough...

234
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,541
[ANDROID 16 sighs]

235
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,333
[TRUNKS] That's when
we discovered that Cell,

236
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,708
Dr. Gero's ultimate
creation had arrived.

237
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:48,875
That creature...

238
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,708
That terrible creature
from the future!

239
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,833
By my calculations he
must have arrived here

240
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,958
at least a year before I did...

241
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,208
Lying dormant until
the time was right

242
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,333
for him to unite with
Dr. Gero's other androids.

243
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,916
But I don't understand how the
ship he came here in

244
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,416
could be exactly
the same as mine?

245
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,333
In fact, that ship IS mine!

246
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,958
[TRUNKS] By travelling back
and forth through time,

247
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,166
have I unwillingly had
a negative effect

248
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,958
on the future of this world?

249
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,583
Am I responsible for
everything that has happened

250
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,041
up to this point?

251
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,291
Maybe I've had no effect
on anything at all!

252
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,125
Either way there is
no way of stopping

253
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:30,041
what's been set in motion!
The future is now!

254
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,333
[VEGETA] I am
now a Super Saiyan,

255
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:37,291
but I will not stop there!
I will ascend!

256
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,666
[TRUNKS] My father is right!

257
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
Now I must follow his lead

258
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,583
and find some way to push
myself to the next level.

259
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,583
[thinking] That may be the
only hope we have

260
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,541
of beating the Androids
and saving this world!

261
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,250
And mine...

262
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,625
[KRILLIN] Well, bon voyage...

263
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,291
[PICCOLO] He disappeared again!

264
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,041
I'm getting a little
tired of this routine!

265
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,166
We almost had him
this time, Piccolo.

266
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,291
We're getting closer and
closer to catching him

267
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,000
every time he shows himself!

268
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,791
He can't outrun us forever.

269
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,041
[KRILLIN thinking] Aww man, but
now we have to wait

270
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,833
until Cell attacks again
before we can find him...

271
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,666
How many innocent people is
that monster going to hurt?

272
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,125
[KRILLIN] We have to do
better than this, you guys!

273
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:28,291
We can't let this happen again!

274
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,083
[TIEN] We know, Krillin...
We're doing everything we can...

275
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,291
We'll find him.

why are we off the road?

sense of adventure, 18?

close to Goku's house?

Well done. Once again
you've managed to destroy

had of having fun.

much faster this way.

[REPORTER 2] The creature
continues its path

294
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,041
of relentless destruction,
sparing no one

295
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,250
who happens to
cross it's path.

296
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,666
Reports are coming
in from South City

297
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,250
that the creature has been
sighted all over town.

298
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,333

299
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,541
[KRILLIN] He's on
the attack again!

00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,625
What are we doing here
watching television?!

301
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,458
We should be
helping those people!

302
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,208
We out number Cell!
We can beat him!

303
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,666

306
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,458
[YAMCHA] As long as we
keep our energy levels down,

307
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,291
Cell won't be sense us
coming. Then he's ours!

308
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,291
Yeah, when all of us
jump out of this plane

309
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,666
and go after Cell at the same
time, he won't stand a chance!

310
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,750
Right! Together we'll
take him down!

311
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,750
There's no way he can
handle all of us.

312
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,125
You guys are right! If we
come at him from all sides,

313
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,625
he won't know what hit him!

314
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,416
[PICCOLO] Cell is
much smarter than that!

315
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,250
There's a good chance
he's expecting us

316

00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,666
Hey!

355
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,000
Oh, Goku!

356
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:09,333
[CHICHI sobs]

357
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,708
I'm sorry I
worried you, ChiChi.

358
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:16,458
Everything's gonna be alright.
I'm all better now.

359
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,958
Are you sure, Goku?

360
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,125
Yeah! Here, see for yourself!

361
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,125
[BOTH laugh]

362
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,458
Oh, Goku!

363
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,000
[BOTH laugh]

364
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,750
[CHICHI screams]

365
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,333
Uh-oh...

366
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,458
I've really gotta start
watching my strength.

367
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,625
[CHICHI screams]

368
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:39,041
Oh my!

369
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,333
Sorry about that.

370
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,041
[GOKU laughs]

371
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,125
[ROSHI] Goku!

372
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,500
Oh, hi!

373
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,208
[ROSHI] So,
you're all better?

374
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,458
Sure! I feel just fine!

375
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,541
In my dreams I could hear
everything that was going on.

376
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,041
We're in deep trouble aren't we?

377
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:58,666
But... I'm not ready
to fight just yet...

378
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,583
Goku? Why not?

379
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,375
Of course he's not.
You still need to rest.

380
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,291
So just stay put!

381
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,541
Hey, I'm alright.
Just relax now...

382
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,375
It's time for me to start
my training once again!

383
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,375
It's time for me to
move to the next level!

384
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,250
[CHICHI gasps]

385
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,916
What?

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,750
[GOKU] Vegeta knows it too.

387
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,791
Through my dreams,
I could hear him speaking

388
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,541
what I had also felt.

389
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,500
That there is a level beyond
that of a Super Saiyan...

390
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,541
And I will rise to claim it!

391
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,000
Huh?!

392
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,166
[NARRATOR] Has Goku
lost his mind?

393
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,291
Maybe he's still
running a fever?

394
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,041
He seems determined to take
his Super Saiyan powers

395
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,291
to the next level. But is it
actually possible for him

396
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,666
to become an
Ascended Saiyan?

397
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,291
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
