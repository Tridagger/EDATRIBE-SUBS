00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,416
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,291
After Bulma, Krillin and Gohan
crash-landed on Planet Namek,

3
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,958
two friendly local
inhabitants were waiting,

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,125
ready to offer
a helping hand...

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,625
Showing more hospitality than
the three were accustomed to,

6
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,125
the Nameks decided to
help their new friends

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,000
find the missing
Dragon Balls.

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,166
[RAITI] Got it!

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,041
[NARRATOR] But even
such dedicated help

10
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:36,833
couldn't keep the
road to discovery

11
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,000
from being littered
with obstacles.

12
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,875
[BULMA screaming]

13
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,916
Flashing Attack... Haah!

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
[NARRATOR] The search for
the remaining Dragon Balls

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:53,833
continues on today's
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

16
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,916
[VEGETA thinking]
Kakarot!

17
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,458
[NURSE yawning]

18
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541
Phew!

19
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,250
[GOKU yelling]

20
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:53,416
[CHICHI gently snoring]

21
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,875
I think we should
find the Dragon Balls

22
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,416
as soon as possible
so we can go

23
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,375
and sleep in our
own beds for once.

24
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,125
Well, that sounds great,
but this planet is so huge.

25
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,750
I kinda get the feeling 
this is gonna take a while.

26
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,166
Don't worry. We'll
find them in no time.

27
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,916
There's nothing I like more
than a positive attitude.

28
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,041
Hey, how come Raiti
didn't come with us?

29
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,791
Unfortunately,
he had to stay home

30
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,250
and finish some
work in the garage.

31
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,458
This is strange...

32
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:30,791
The radar is telling
me that a Dragon Ball

33
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,125
is approaching
us dead ahead!

34
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,375
[BULMA]
See what I mean?

35
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,250
[GOHAN] It's
moving pretty fast.

36
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,083
What's that?

37
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,500
Wha--!

38
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,875
What are you doing?

39
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,083
Don't just stand there,
get the Dragon Ball!

40
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,541
[ALL] Uhh.

41
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,083
Come on, Krillin! Hurry up and
get it before it blows away!

42
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,416
W-Wait, hold up!

43
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,791
Why don't we wait for the
tornado to disappear?

44
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,750
[ZAACRO chuckling]

45
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,916
You're gonna have
to wait a long time.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,250
On this planet,
tornadoes have been known

47
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,083
to wander the
plains for ages.

48
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,583
Zaacro and I are
gonna take cover.

49
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:41,875
Don't waste any more
time, okay? Go!

50
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,833
What are you doing?
Don't stare at it!

51
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,083
Go get it!

52
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,958
Man... She's bossy.

53
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,708
Are you ready to go
head-to-head with a tornado?

54
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,875
Yup.

55
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,333
Let's do it!

56
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,041
Desctructo Disk!

57
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,125
Yaah!

58
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,125
Masenko...

59
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,125
Wait, guys! Stop!
Don't do that!

60
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:13,458
You'll destroy the Dragon
Ball if you attack it!

61
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,333
Oh yeah. I forgot.

62
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,250
Where are those
fools going?

63
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,166
Why don't they
ever listen to me?!

64
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,500
It's coming right
for us! Quick, run!

65
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,875
This is exactly the kind
of thing that makes me

66
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,458
want to never come back
to this horrible planet!

67
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,416
Keep running!

68
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,625
[GOHAN whimpering]

69
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,458
I'm just a technical
girl who works in a lab

70
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,208
tinkering with
robotics and microchips!

71
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,958
How do I end up
running from tornadoes

72
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,166
and flying all over the galaxy
looking for Dragon Balls?!

73
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
Just don't stop!

74
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,500
[thinking] I've got to get
that Dragon Ball back!

75
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,708
Piccolo's life
depends on it!

76
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,208
[thinking] 
Whatever it takes!

77
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,041
[thinking]
There it is!

78
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,958
All right!

79
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,875
Masenko...

80
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,333
Ha!

81
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:45,875
Gohan!

82
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,583
Are you okay?

83
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,208
Look what
I got!

84
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,416
Nice going!

85
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,000
[GOHAN] Woo-hoo!

86
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,458
That makes
three left!

87
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:54,916
[GOHAN laughing]

88
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:05,166
[thinking] It sure feels good
to be out of that hospital.

89
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,583
I was so sick of these
bandages tying me down.

90
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,291
The only way
to get better

91
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,291
is to get out there
and keep training!

92
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,750
Hyaah!

93
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,125
[GOKU grunting painfully]

[beeping]

96
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:32,125
The next one is that
way. I'm sure of it.

97
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,916
I hope we can find our
way in this dense jungle.

98
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,458
I'm gonna make a torch
so we can see better.

99
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,875
[strange screeching]

100
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:03,916
That didn't sound
very comforting.

101
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,125
[strange screeching]

102
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,208

[GOHAN]
Wow! What a view!

107
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:21,125
[BULMA] Help! Grab me,
I'm about to fall off!

108

[BULMA screaming]

109
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:25,666
[KRILLIN] There.

110
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,791
[KRILLIN chuckling]

111
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:34,583
Look! It's a castle!

[birds screeching]

115
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,916
So, what do you think
we should do now?

116
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have no other choice.
We'll have to jump.

117
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,416
You can't be serious!
That's crazy!

118
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,750
Either we jump, or we become
this bird's next meal.

119
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,166
[screeches]

120
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,541
Fine! I'll jump!

121
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
But only if you
promise you'll catch me

122
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,208
before I hit
the ground!

123
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:27,666
[KRILLIN] Don't worry!
I'll catch you!

124

You're all going
to suffer...

128
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,458
And when you beg
me for mercy...

129
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,833
I'll stare into your
eyes as I crush you...

130

I won't stand a
chance against Vegeta.

134
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,750
Not like this!

[snake hissing]

140
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,291
I'm getting a
strong reading

141
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,583
from the Dragon Ball
right in front of us.

Bulma, we're
gonna check it out.

146
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,833
You stay here
and stand watch.

147
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,500
This thing wouldn't wake up
if we screamed in its ear.

148
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,583
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin!
Any luck finding it yet?

149
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,125
No, nothing yet. Hey,
Zaacro, what about you?

150
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,208
I haven't
found anything.

151
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,125
Tell me: where did you
hide the Dragon Ball?!

Safe!

162
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,750
Now, let's leave this
oversized nightmare.

[CHICHI] Great! First
my son, now my husband.

166
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,291
[ROSHI] Hmm. Come on, don't
take it so hard. You know Goku.

167
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,541
I'm sure he had a perfectly
good reason to leave.

168
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,291
What?! A good reason to
leave? Yeah, right!

169
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:36,375
Those two go running off at
the first sign of adventure,

170
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,041
leaving the rest
of us sit around,

171
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,666
pay the bills,
and worry about them!

172
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,458
Woah, woah, woah!
Hold on now, ChiChi!

173
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:45,041
We both know very
well that they

174
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,708
can take care of themselves
just fine without us.

175
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,250
Are you out of your mind?!

176
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,166
Goku even forgot to
pack his sweater!

177
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,500
I go through the trouble of
making this, and he forgets it!

178
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,333
Why, I could strangle
him with it!

179
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:59,541
[BULMA] Okay,
here's the throttle...

00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,250
Check the
fuel gauge...

181
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,958
I think I found what
I'm having for lunch!

182
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,875
Bulma, I don't
mean to rush you,

183
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,541
but I don't
wanna be lunch!

184
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,791
I could work
a lot faster

185
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,083
if you would stop being
such a backseat flyer!

186
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
[roaring]

187
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,375
You know, taking the stairs
would be faster than this!

188
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,791
Instead of
whining so much,

189
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,125
why don't you try and do
something with the angry giant?!

190
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,125
[roaring continues]

191
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,291
All right,
Bulma. Fine.

192
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,500
You ready, Gohan?

193
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:27,500
[GOHAN] Yup!

194
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,041
I'm gonna tear
all of you apart!

195
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,708
[BOTH growling]

196
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,458
[BULMA] I don't
get it.

197
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,333
How can there not be
an oil pressure gauge?

198
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,333
And what
does this do?

199
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,916
[BULMA growling]

200
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,041
I have had it
with this thing!

201
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:56,750
[engine sputtering]

202
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:57,750
I did it!

203
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,125
I knew my genius,
scientific mind

204
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,208
would come in
handy at some point!

205
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,875
Destructo Disk!

206
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,208
Yaah...

207
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,125
Hyaah!

208
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,208
[GIANT groaning]

209
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,875
Masenko Ha!

210
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
Haah!

211
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,000
[BOTH] We did it!

212
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:21,916
[GIANT growling]

213
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,208
[GOHAN and KRILLIN whimpering]

214
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,708
[BOTH] Hyaah!

215
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,541
[GIANT roaring]

216
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,958
[BOTH gasping]

217
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,750
[GIANT snarling]

218
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,125
[GOHAN laughing]

219
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,541
Nice catch,
Bulma!

220
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,833
Maybe you'd like
to apologize

221
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,291
for the comments
you made earlier?

222
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,625
You always second-guess
my abilities,

223
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,208
yet I seem to be the one
saving you all the time!

224
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,666
Is that really true?

225
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,416
Now, we only
have two left!

226
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,291
We should be able to go home
much sooner than I anticipated.

227
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,250
I'm all for that plan.

228
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,250
Uh? Eh?!

229
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,750
Eh? Eh?!

230
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:54,958
[GOKU grunting]

231
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,708
[thinking]
Boy, it sure is nice

232
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,958
to feel the wind
through my hair again.

233
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,833
Aahhh...

234
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,166
He looks strong.

235
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,666
[DOCTOR] I think he
may be ready.

236
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,166
But, let's keep emergency
equipment on standby,

237
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,250
just in case the
worst happens.

238
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,125
I'll initiate the draining
procedure, right...

239
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Now.

240
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,833
You are fully healed now.
You can open your eyes.

241
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,458
Unfortunately,
we weren't successful

242
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,250
in reconstructing
your tail.

243
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:35,041
[VEGETA] No matter.
I don't need it.

244
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's
recovery has finally ended

245
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,208
and his next terrifying
battle with Goku

246
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,958
is waiting on
the horizon!

247
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,250
Don't miss it as the
adventure continues

248
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,208
on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
