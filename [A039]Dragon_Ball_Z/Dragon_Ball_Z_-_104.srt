00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,583
Goku said his
farewells to Frieza,

3
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,375
deciding that the
weakened tyrant,

4
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,833
was no longer a threat
to the Universe!

5
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:25,291
[GOKU sighs]

6
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,958
[GOKU] Goodbye, Frieza.

7
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,416
May you live the rest
of your life in peace.

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,958
"Peace"?!

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,791
[NARRATOR] But peace wasn't
quite what Frieza had in mind!

10
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,041
As Goku launched off
towards his ship,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,416
Frieza unleashed
his final attack:

12
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,875
[FRIEZA] Never!

13
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:46,208
I will never... never...

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,083
[NARRATOR] An energy disk that
can cut through anything,

15
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,291
and will follow Goku
wherever he goes!

16
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,291
You truly are a helpless fool!

17
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,541
I gave you one last
chance to live!

18
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

19
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,875
[GOKU growls]

20
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,916
[GOKU] And this is
how you repay me?!

21
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
[GOKU growls]

22
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,125
[NARRATOR] And so, the epic
battle between good and evil

23
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,750
swings back to life.

24
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,166
But with little time to spare!

25
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,500
Can the enraged Goku
avoid this last attack,

26
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:51,125
put an end to Frieza, and escape
from Namek before it blows?

27
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,333
[NARRATOR} It's a time bomb
the size of a planet,

28
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,958
on this explosive
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,791
[FRIEZA thinking] He thinks he
can pull up at the last second

30
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,708
and make the disc hit me!

31
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:46,500
[FRIEZA giggles]

32
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,125
[FRIEZA laughs]

33
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
[thinking] As if
I'm stupid enough

34
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,291
to be cut by my own attack!

35
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,958
You'll have to be much
more clever than that!

36
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,000
[FREIZA yells]

37
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,958
Gotcha!

38
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,625
[FRIEZA growls]

39
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,416
[GOKU] Looking for someone?

40
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,291
An after-image, eh?

41
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:32,666
That's a pretty good
little trick for a primate.

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,916
I don't understand why you call
Saiyans by such mindless names.

43
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The only thing it does is reveal
your own fear and ignorance.

44
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,625
[FRIEZA growls]

45
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,416
I guess name-calling
is your only attack

46
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,458
because you're too weak to
challenge me any other way.

47
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:55,833
[FRIEZA growls]

48
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:59,583
[thinking] No one talks
to me like that!

49
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,083
Hmm...

50
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,000
Tell us, King Kai... What now?

51
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:37,791
[KING KAI] Goku seems
to be in complete control.

52
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,000
Huh?!

53
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,125
Then, you mean
Frieza's gonna lose?

54
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,958
[KING KAI] Yes, Chiaotzu...

55
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:48,333
It looks like Frieza's on
his last legs, but who cares?!

56
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,416
Maybe Goku is winning! Maybe
he'll beat Frieza after all!

57
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,166
But even if he does, the
planet is going to explode!

58
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,875
And Goku will still be doomed!

59
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:13,291
So my energy disk wasn't
challenging enough for you, huh?

60
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,750
[FRIEZA chuckles]

61
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:19,458
[FRIEZA] I guess we'll just
have to raise the stakes!

62
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,125
And double the fun!

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,791
As you wish, Frieza...

64
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,125
Give me a break!
Not this stupid routine again!

65
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:43,833

[VEGETA laughs]

71
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,875
Oh, this is too much! One
little explosion and "boom",

72
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,375
Frieza and Kakarot
are both out of my hair!

73
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,666
At last, I'm the most powerful
fighter in the Universe!

74
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,875
[GOHAN growls]

75

[GURU wheezes]

77
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,083
I've waited so long
for this day!

78
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,875
Those years with Frieza,
swallowing my humiliation!

79
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,291
[VEGETA] We followed
Frieza's every command,

80
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,000
like sick, loyal dogs!

81
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
[screaming]

82
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,166
[VEGETA] We conquered
entire civilizations,

83
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,500
annihilated millions of people,

84
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,000
just to expand Frieza's empire!

85
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:36,041
[screaming continues]

86
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:48,041
[screaming continues]

87
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,875
[VEGETA laughs]

88
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,000
[VEGETA] Needless to say it was
a job we Saiyans excelled at.

89
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:05,791
[VEGETA laughs]

90

[screaming]

92
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,625
[NAPPA] That was great!

93
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,375
[RADITZ] Yes,
but I can't wait

94
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,750
to get to my healing capsule!

95
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,208
All this fighting
has made me sore!

96
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,750
[ALL laughing]

97
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,750
[NAPPA] Can you believe how
fast we banged up that planet?!

98
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:49,041
I bet Frieza will
give us a huge reward!

99
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,375
[RADITZ] Oh, yes!

100
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:54,666
[NAPPA &amp; RADITZ laugh]

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,583
Greetings, Master Frieza.

102
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,958
We have returned
from the planet Shik.

103
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,166
Everything was
done as you desired.

104
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,541
They pledged loyalty to you
after only three short days.

105
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,333
Hmm...

106
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,041
Did they really?

107
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm surprised it took so long.

[ZARBON chuckles]

111
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:33,916
Very well, then.
You may go away now.

112
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,375
Huh?!

113
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,875
Hey! Wait! Is that all
you're going say to us?!

114
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,333
[VEGETA gasps]

115
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,916
We just crushed an entire race
of people in only three days!

116
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,750
And all you say is-is--!

117
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,125
Tell me, Zarbon,

118
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,333
how long do you think
it would take you

119
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,583
to conquer a planet like Shik?

120
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,916
Well, I imagine one
full day would be enough.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,958
Really? A whole day?
It is a tiny planet.

122
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,416

[NAPPA &amp; RADITZ growl]

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,833
Is there anything else
you'd like to report to me?

128
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:23,208
You do understand I have
more significant matters

129
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,083
to attend to?

130

[FRIEZA laughs]

135
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,833
Please excuse us, Master Frieza.

136
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,541
[ZARBON] What more
can you expect...

137
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,500
[ZARBON chuckles]

138
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,041
...from a monkey?

[VEGETA growls]

140
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,000
[NAPPA] I hate this! You
know, I've been hearing

141
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,416
talk about how our
home planet was destroyed.

142
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,208
At first I didn't
believe it, but now...

143
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,833
They say it didn't really
collide with another planet!

144
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,416
Like we thought...

145
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,666
What do you mean?

146
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,666
They say that Frieza did it!

147
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,333
Huh... Why?

148
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,791
Rrrgh... Vegeta, you
have to listen to me!

149
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,166
It was Frieza that
ordered it all!

150
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,208
To have your father killed!
And to blow up our home planet!

151
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,666
[VEGETA] I already knew that.

152
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,250
What? You knew?!

153
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,000
But how can you obey Frieza when
you know what he's done to us?!

154
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,833
[VEGETA] So he killed my father,
destroyed my people...

155
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,625
That means nothing to me now!

156
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,291
Strength is the only thing
that matters in this world.

157
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,625
Huh?

158
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,583
Everything else is just
a delusion for the weak.

159
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,833
There's only one
certainty in life:

160
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,708
[VEGETA] A strong man stands
above and conquers all!

161
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,291
[VEGETA] I know how
strong Frieza is.

162
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,625
There's no way
I can beat him now.

163
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,000
But wait and see,
as the last of the Saiyans,

164
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,958
we have flowing
through our veins

165
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,958
the blood of a warrior race!

166
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,208
The more we fight, the
more powerful we become!

167
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:51,291
And with each fight, I'll
get stronger and stronger!

168
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,833
[VEGETA growls]

169
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,791
[VEGETA] And one day I'll be
strong enough to beat Frieza,

170
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,166
and I will rule the Universe!

171
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,000
Exactly as I was meant to...

172
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,166
At last, that
great day has come!

173
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,000
Everyone who would
stop me is already dead!

174
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:20,833
[VEGETA laughs]

175
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,791
You're wrong about
all that, you know!

176
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,625
My father is coming back alive!

177
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,791
Huh?

178
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,875
[VEGETA chuckles]

179
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,416
[GOHAN growls]

180
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,291
[VEGETA sighs]

181
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:39,375
You sure do have a
wild imagination, kid.

182
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,875
No, it's the truth!

183
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,791
My dad'll beat Frieza
and come back home

184
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,541
and then
you'll be sorry!

185
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,583
[GOHAN growls]

186
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,833
[FRIEZA chuckles]

187
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:06,000
Monkey, I do think it would be
wiser for you to keep running!

188
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,458
[FRIEZA laughs]

189
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,916
Because I would just hate to
see you sliced into pieces!

190
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,708
[GOKU grunts]

191
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,666
When will you
ever learn, Frieza?

192
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,833
Please! Can't you try
something a tiny bit different?

193
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,416
[GOKU grunts]

194
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,875
Huh?!

195
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,166
[FRIEZA growls]

196
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,250
[FRIEZA] Nothing
but a lucky shot!

197
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,291
Now where'd that monkey go?!

198
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,041
[GOKU growls]

199
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,291
[FRIEZA grunts]

200
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
[FRIEZA growls]

201
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,708
[grunting]

202
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:15,208
[GOKU grunts]

203
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,041
[FRIEZA yells]

204
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,791
[FRIEZA grunts]

205
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,750
[GOKU] I'm gonna slap
some sense into you!

206
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:27,333
[FRIEZA grunting]

207
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:31,625
Oh yeah! Okay! Give it to
him, Goku! Oh boy! Uh-huh!

208
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:35,041
Make him really feel it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

209
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,000
[FRIEZA yells]

210
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,583
[GOKU yells]

211
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,583
[FRIEZA gasps]

212
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,375
[GOKU yells]

213
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,833
[FRIEZA grunts]

214
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,208
It's time to finish this
fight once and for all!

215
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,791
Hey! Look out behind you!

216
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,041
Get down now!

217
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,375
Huh...?

218
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,833
[GOKU gasps]

219
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:23,000
My own attack...

220
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,291
[KING KAI screams]

221
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,375
Just tell us, King Kai,
we can handle it!

222
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,375
It's Goku! He's
been defeated, right?

223
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,791
[KING KAI] Umm, no...

224
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:41,791
Let's just say Frieza
isn't feeling, uhh...

225
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,916
Quite complete.

226
00:18:56,458 --> 00:19:05,583
[FRIEZA whimpering]

227
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,791
Though you brought
all this on yourself,

228
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:28,000
it's a shame that your life had
to end in such a miserable way.

229
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,416
[FRIEZA coughs]

230
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,625
I wanted to save you Frieza,
but you wouldn't let me...

231
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,833
And now you will have to
share the fate of planet Namek,

232
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,916
which you yourself destroyed.

233
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,708
[FRIEZA coughs]

234
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:49,125
[GOKU] I'm tired of
fighting. I'm going home.

235
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,583
[GOKU] Goodbye, Frieza...

236
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:01,166
[FRIEZA whimpers]

237
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,583
Please... help me...

238
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:08,583
You... can't leave me here...

239
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,083
[GOKU gasps]

240
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,541
[FRIEZA] You can't...
let me... die like this...

241
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,666
[GOKU growls]

242
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,958
[KING KAI gasps]

243
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,583
Goku! You mustn't listen to him!

244
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,916
You have to get off
the planet now!

245
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:42,666
[GOKU growls]

246
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,458
You... have to help... me...

247
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,833
[GOKU growls]

248
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,875
Don't... let me die...

249
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,750
[GOKU growls]

250
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:04,791
Please... have mercy...!

251
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,541
How many people begged for
their lives at YOUR feet,

252
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,875
and you killed them anyway?!

253
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,333
Did you show ME mercy
when I asked you to spare

254
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,791
my best friend Krillin?!

255
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,166
[FRIEZA] Please... Please...

256
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,125
For... give... me...

257
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,125
[GOKU sighs]

258
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,958
[GOKU yells]

259
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,666
[FRIEZA grunts softly]

260
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,625
Huh...?

261
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,583
I gave you some
of my own energy...

262
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,666
You should be able to move.

263
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,333
[GOKU] Go and do
as you like with it.

264
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,625
[GOKU] You're on your own now.

265
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,083
[VEGETA laughs]

266
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,166
Hurry back, Dad...

267
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,791
[NARRATOR] At last, the mighty
Frieza has been derailed,

268
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,166
cut down by his
own deadly attack.

269
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,333
Could this truly
be the end of Frieza?

270
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:53,958
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
