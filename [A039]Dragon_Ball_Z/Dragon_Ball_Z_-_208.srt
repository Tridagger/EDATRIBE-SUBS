00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,666
Gohan trained Videl and Goten
in the secret art of flying.

3
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,958
[NARRATOR] After learning to
concentrate her energy,

4
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,000
Videl worked on using this
power to lift into the air.

5
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,166
It was a lesson learned
with impressive speed,

6
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,291
as what she lacked in experience

7
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:40,000
was made up for with
strength and determination.

8
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,333
[GOHAN] That's incredible,
Videl!

9
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,041
No one learns how to
fly on their first day!

10
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,875
Is that a fact?

11
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,666
[GOTEN] A birdie! A birdie!

12
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,000
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, Vegeta and
Trunks did training of their own

13
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,041
in an enhanced gravity room.

14
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,125
And Vegeta learned a
surprising ability of his son...

15
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
[VEGETA] So what
are you going to do?

16
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,708
Guess I'll go... Super!

17
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,291
Huh?!

18
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,041
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,083
[NARRATOR] The preparations
are in the works,

20
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,250
and the tournament day is near.

21
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,250
[VEGETA] When was it that the
transformation to the legendary

22
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,958
warrior of the Saiyan race

23
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,458
was reduced to a
children's plaything?!

24
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,916
[VIDEL giggles]

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,125
[VIDEL] Look, Gohan!
I'm higher than the trees!

26
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,833
[GOHAN] Yeah!

27
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,750
You soak this stuff up
like a sponge!

28
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,166
[VIDEL laughs]

29
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,250
[GOHAN] Now we can work
on the harder moves!

30
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,375
[laughing continues]

31
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,375
[GOTEN] Hah! Yeah!

32
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:59,916
[GOTEN laughs]

33
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,041
[VIDEL] So... how long does
it take to fly around like that?

34
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
Um... Well...

35
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,208
It just depends on
the person, really.

36
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,125
I won't stop
'til I fly like him!

37
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:27,208
Ah? Uhh...
Hold on just a second...

38
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
This is so awesome! Yeaah!

39
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,791
[GOTEN laughs]

40
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,458
[GOTEN laughs]

41
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,791
[GOTEN] Whoa!

42
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,250
Hey, bro... Try to slow it
down while Videl's here,

43
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,958
--could ya?
--But how come?

44
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:47,958
Just do it for me, okay?!

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:51,916
[VIDEL] Problem?

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,791
No! Just gave him
a little advice!

47
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,333
[VIDEL sighs]

48
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,791
It's break time...

49
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,791
[VIDEL] Listen...

50
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,875
I'd rather you don't tell
my dad about these lessons.

51
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,666
I want it to be a surprise
at the tournament, okay?

52
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,125
Sure! Don't worry.

53
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,291
I never run into him!

54
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,000
And that's for good reason!

55
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,166
If he knew I was hanging out
at a boy's house...

56
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,375
Well, I know exactly
what he would say...

57
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,291
I forbid it! You find a boy
who's stronger than I am

58
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,416
and then maybe I'll consider!
I mean, maybe I'll consider...

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,208
He says it 'cause he knows
there aren't any boys like that.

60
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:43,375
I mean, he saved the
whole world with his strength.

61
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,791
You're a pretty tough
guy, Gohan.

62
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,958
But you can hardly say
something like that!

63
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,583
[GOHAN laughs]

64
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,083
Videl...

65
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,083
Has your dad ever let you have
practice matches with him?

66
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:59,166
Come on, are you kidding?
He's the World Champion!

67
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,208
He'd tear me apart!

68
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:04,083
Dad doesn't even let me
watch him train now!

69
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,583
It's all a secret.

70
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,541
[GOHAN laughs]

71
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,041
[thinking] Yeah, no wonder.

72
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,166
He doesn't want Videl to know
she's stronger than he is!

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,583
So, um...

74
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,583
In the extremely unlikely
chance that someone, say,

75
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,000
beats your father...

76
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,250
You think you'd freak out?

77
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,916
I wish he'd lose!

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,083
This fame has gone
to Dad's head!

79
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,625
I know mom's been
gone for a while...

80
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,416
but that doesn't mean he
can go flouncing everywhere

81
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,166
with these silly women!

82
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,750
If he got beat,
they'd all disappear!

83
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,208
[GOHAN laughs]

84
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:41,458
[thinking] Perfect!

85
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,250
Now I can beat her dad
without feeling guilty!

86
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,625
[VIDEL] But unfortunately
that'll never happen.

87
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,333
My Dad's too strong
for his own good.

88
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,708
Now I've got a question:

89
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,041
Who taught you
these martial arts?

90
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,875
Well... First someone named
Piccolo and then my dad...

91
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:04,666
So, if your dad knows a
few fighting techniques

92
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,750
how come you've never
introduced him to me?

93
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,416
--My dad's not with us.
--But he's gonna be soon!

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,583
The lady's bringing him
back from the dead,

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,541
so he can play at
the big tournament!

96
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:20,166
What? What's back from
the dead? And what lady?

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,791
What do you mean?

98
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,541
Clamp it, Goten!

99
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,500
You're not supposed to
talk about that!

100
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,916
[GOTEN gasps]

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,875
Oh! I get it! Your
parents are now divorced!

102
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,291
And he's with a new woman!

103
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,583
And she's bringing
him to the tournament

104
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,750
so he can fight and win money!

105
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:40,958
Is that right?

106
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,458
[GOHAN] Hm?

107
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,791
[VIDEL] Oh yeah...

108
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:47,625
Seems we both have trouble
with parents. Mm-hmm.

109
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,083
I... guess...

110
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,750
All the more reason
we have to work together!

111
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,125
[MR. SATAN] Hey, you!
Servant guy!

112
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,916
Has Videl come in yet?!

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,750
[SERVANT] No sir.
The Mistress is still out.

114
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,541
She said she had errands to run.

115

116
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,208
[MR. SATAN] Errands my foot!

117
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:11,083
She's probably with
a boy right now!

118
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:14,708
[NARRATOR] The days roll on, and
Videl's long training sessions

119
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,833
are starting to pay off.

--[VIDEL] Oh!

121
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,375
Sorry about that, Goten!

123
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:27,833
[thinking] Videl is really
something special.

124
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,583
She's nearly mastered flying
after only ten days of practice!

125
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:40,875
Guess that does it, Videl!
You've graduated flying school!

126
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,541
Thanks a lot, Gohan.

127
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,083
Now I can go home and
finish off my training

128
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,541
in time for the tournament.

129
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,250
Yeah, me too...

130
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916
Well, I'm off.

Hey, wow!

132
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,625
I bet I can fly home this way!

133
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,250
Yup.

134
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,708
Goodbye, boys! I'll
see you at the big match!

00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,375
--Goodbye, Videl!

Finally, she's gone!

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,541
[GOHAN] Hey...
She's not so bad...

139
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,375
But yeah... Now that
it's just the two of us,

140
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,083
we can start our real
training sessions together!

141
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,833
Yeah!

142
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,291

[GOTEN grunts]

182
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,666
No fair... As hard as I try,
I still can't beat you!

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,791
Hey, I've been
doing this a lot longer

184
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,500
than you have, little guy!

185
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,625
But those were some nice
moves you pulled!

186
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you think our father's
really going to be there?

187
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,458
Guess it's gonna be your
first time to see him, isn't it?

188
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,958
You nervous?

189
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,833
Yeah...

190
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,708
The arrangements
have been made.

191
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:45,000
Is Goku ready for his
grand re-entrance?

192
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,708
[KING KAI] He's up there...

193
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:49,791
He finished his training
a few days ago.

194
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,750
Now he is training his mind
with intense meditation.

195
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,583
[VEGETA] I've ridden Galactic
Slugs faster than this vehicle!

196
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,958
[BULMA] Oh, hush!

197
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,208
So... Is Goku really
going to show up?

198
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,500
He'll be there! I know it!

199
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:50,416
Heh, heh! When has Goku
ever let us down before?

200
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,375
Of course he'll be there!

201
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,958
So, Krillin, I bet he'll
hardly recognize you

202
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,666
with your goofy hairdo!

203
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,208
Hey... It's stylish!

204
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,291
[OX-KING and YAMCHA laugh]

205
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,250
I forgot just how funny
you guys are together!

206
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,416
[OX-KING laughs]

207
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,250
Crack me up!

208
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
Are you going to be
competing too, Yamcha?

209
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,541
[YAMCHA] Me? Nah,
I'd just embarrass myself.

210
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,291
I gave up fighting...

211
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:21,708
So, listen Vegeta-- And this
goes for you kids too...

212
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,416
I think we should all agree

213
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,875
to not turn into Super
Saiyans during the fights.

214
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,291
What for?!

215
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,791
That's a good idea!

216
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,125
If people see you
guys transform,

217
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,916
there's a good chance
they'll recognize you

218
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,041
from the broadcasts
of the Cell Games!

219
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,083
And after that! Well...

220
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,375
The journalists would
get all your names

221
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,125
off of the entry forms and--

222
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,375
OH!-- TV cameras would be
all over my front yard!

223
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,291
Yeah, then you'd all know
what I have to deal with

224
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,875
in high school!
It's a real mess!

225
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,875
[VEGETA] I don't
see the problem.

226
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,875
When the journalists come,
I'll just destroy them!

227
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,750
[BULMA] Vegeta! Would
you behave yourself?

228
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,750
Fine... It's settled...

229
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,291
There'll be no Super Saiyan
transformations

230
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,833
in the battles...

231
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,208
Of course, I'll still
have the advantage.

232
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,291
That's okay
with us, Dad!

233
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,500
Yeah!

234
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,166
Alright! Thanks, everyone!

235
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,666
That sure is good news for me!

236
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,958
Heck, maybe this way
I'll stand a chance!

237
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,291
[KRILLIN laughs]

238
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,333
[KRILLIN] Y'know, fighting
a Super Saiyan is like

239
00:15:21,416 --> 00:15:23,583
trying to fight a steamroller
with your hands tied!

240
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,583
--[KRILLIN laughs]
--[VEGETA] Pipe down!

241
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,500
[KRILLIN] Oh, sorry.

[BULMA gasps]

243
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,458
Look, guys! I see it!
There's the island

244
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,625
where the World Martial Arts
Tournament is taking place!

245
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,666
Ahhh... It's game time!

246
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,750
Hey!

247
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,791
Guess I better
complete my outfit now!

248
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:42,791
[GOHAN laughs]

249
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,458
Uhh...

250
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,500
[MARRON] Huh?

251
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,041
Hey, Gohan...

252
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
Are you really gonna
wear that thing to fight?

253
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,791
Yeah! This way they
won't recognize me!

254
00:15:54,875 --> 00:15:56,750
Do I look cool or what?!

255
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,916
--Uh, yeah... "cool".

Ah, gee, look at all that
stuff! It's like a world fair!

258
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:22,791
You know I can't stand
to be around crowds.

259
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,166
I wonder if Goku's here...

--[OX-KING] What?!

[BOY] Wait for me! I saw him
first! I wanna get there first!

263
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,291
I want an autograph!

264
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:35,916
Oh, look guys, our hero! The
man who saved us all from Cell

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,125
'cause we were
too weak, remember?!

266
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:41,583
Do they really
believe that? Mr. Satan...

267
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,041
He sure does like to
ham it up, doesn't he?

268

his daughter, Gohan!

the world, wait no more!

Your hero has arrived!

276
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:14,541
Mr. Satan, do you believe
you'll have any competition?

277

[MR. SATAN laughs]

278
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,291
Let's just say my
chances of winning

279
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,375
are about one hundred
and twenty percent!

280
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,333
We've heard that your daughter
is also taking part!

281
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:28,333
Videl, what will you do if
you have to fight your Dad?

282
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,083
Oh, I don't know...
guess I'll punch?

Old fool still hasn't
changed a bit.

287
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,500
Forget about him, Yamcha.

288
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,083
I'd much rather
track down my dad.

289
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:48,375
I don't sense Goku here,
but someone else we know is.

290
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:52,750
[GOTEN] Huh? Look!
It's Mister Piccolo!

291
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,958
Wow! He showed up!

292
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,500
[GOHAN] Hello, Piccolo!

293
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,333
I don't suppose you've
seen my father yet?

294
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,208
Not yet. But he'll be here.

295
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:10,208
That outfit... You're really
going to fight in that?

296
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,666
Of course!

297
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,500
Oh, where in the
world could Goku be?

298
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,416
Gosh, maybe they just weren't
able to bring him back!

299
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,250
I'll go comb the area!

Yeah! Me too.

just gonna stand there

have twenty-four hours.

00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,458
Huh? Who is that?

353
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:06,166
[GOHAN] It's my super
hero name! Cool, huh?

354
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,625
Sure! I guess so!

355
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,333
[GOKU laughs]

356
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:14,750
Next, please!

357
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,541
Ah... Yes...

358
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,125
Another for the junior division!

359
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:20,250
[TRUNKS gasps]

360
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,625
What's that mean?!

361
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,333
It's for everyone
under 15 years old!

362
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,708
Oh, that's great.

363
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,375
They're sticking us with
all the little kids, Goten!

364
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,125
Huh?!

365
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,958
They've changed it from
the old tournaments.

366
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,666
What a good idea!

367
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,791
Thanks for the offer, man, but
we'll take the adult section!

368
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,375
I'm sorry, but I
can't do that!

369
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,583
There's rules!

370
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,458
But that's boring!

371
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,458
[KRILLIN laughs]

372
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,375
Your attention please!

373
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,583
All competitors come
to the waiting area!

374
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:55,208
This is your last call!

375
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:59,083
Now, good luck, Goku
and Gohan and Goten!

376
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,791
I want you boys to do
the best that you can!

377
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,375
Yes!

378
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,791
Don't worry, ChiChi, I'm sure
one of us is gonna win!

379
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,958
[thinking] It's gonna be
great to see Dad fight again!

380
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,875
See you in the finals!

381
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,583
I'll be there!

382
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,541
Don't forget to cheer
for your Daddy, okay?

383
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,000
[MARON] Okay!

384
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,500
[VEGETA] Hmph.

385
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,833
Buh-bye, Mom!

386
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,375
[CHICHI] Bye!

387
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:30,750
Be careful, okay?

388
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,208
Break a leg!

389
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,083
[NARRATOR]
After all these years,

390
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:43,583
Goku is back in the
land of the living.

391
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,541
The Z Fighters reassemble,

392
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:49,041
and the World Martial Arts
Tournament is set to begin.
