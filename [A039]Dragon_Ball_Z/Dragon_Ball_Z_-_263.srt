00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,708
Gotenks, the super being

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,916
formed by the fusion
of Goten and Trunks,

4
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,291
had achieved the
level of Super Saiyan 3

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,916
and was giving Majin Buu
the fight of his life!

6
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,083
[SUPER BUU groans]

7
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,166
[NARRATOR] The seemingly
invincible Buu

8
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,583
had finally met his match!

9
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,500
But when the fusion
began to wear off,

10
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,458
and Gotenks had to power down,

11
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,666
the situation went
from bad to worse!

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,291
[GOTENKS yells]

13
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,875
Let's not be too hasty!

14
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,375
[NARRATOR] Until finally,
to their dismay,

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,291
the duo came unraveled!

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,541
[BOTH]
Hey wait! You're there!

17
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,916
The fusion must be over!

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,916
[NARRATOR] But when it
seemed that all was lost,

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,083
Gohan completed
his power raising

20
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:58,791
under the dubious
guidance of the Elder Kai,

21
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,166
and unleashed a sample
of his newfound ability!

22
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,541
[GOHAN bellows]

23
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,375
[OLD KAI hollers]

24
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,000
[SUPREME KAI yells]

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:10,833
[KIBITO grunts]

26
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,583
This is the last time
I'll get to see you

27
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,750
until you make your
journey over to this world.

28
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,958
You ready? Show him
what a Saiyan's made of!

29
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,583
Yeah!

30
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,291
[NARRATOR]
And just as his father had

31
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,541
so many times before,

32
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:28,333
Gohan arrived on Earth
in the knick of time.

33
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,833
After supplying him with a new
uniform identical to Goku's,

34
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,708
Kibito left
the new savior alone

35
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:35,750
to contemplate his mission.

36
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,958
[NARRATOR]
Look out, Majin Buu!

37
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,791
Here he comes!

38
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,708
[GOHAN]
This is it.

39
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,125
Great! We're done for!
Those imbiciles!

40
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,583
They had the chance
but they blew it!

41
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,125
[TRUNKS]
I don't know what to do!

42
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,458
Without the fusion,
we're cooked!

43
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,666
[GOTEN] Y-You mean
there's a chance

44
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,958
that we're gonna... die?

45
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,333
It's more than just a chance!

46
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,250
You and me are about to
bite the big one, Goten!

47
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,291
Ahh, that's bad!

48
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:47,541
Hey! Why don't we run away?

49
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,416
But do you think we can?

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,875
I guess not. It's over!

51
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:05,583
This isn't any fun! Shoot!
We're way too young to die!

52
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,250
Yeah! We're just little kids!

53
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,166
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

54
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,500
[BOTH whimper]

55
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,500
[SUPER BUU] It's time,
little trouble-makers!

56
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,958
[TRUNKS]
Piccolo!

57
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,875
You two can't have all
the fun. Now it's my turn.

58
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,500
I'll do the best that I can.

59
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:27,666
If it doesn't work,
at least we'll die together.

60
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,000
[TRUNKS] What do you mean
"the best that you can"?

61
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,333
We were both Super Saiyan 3's,
plus we were fused together,

62
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,875
and we still couldn't beat him!

63
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,583
[GOTEN] Yeah! It might
not matter to you

64
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,000
because you're old!

65
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,208
But we're just little kids!
We don't want to die!

66
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,125
[TRUNKS]
Unh-uh!

67
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,750
Do you have any ideas, Trunks?

68
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,208
Yeah...

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,625
I think it might work!

70
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:56,083
What is it, Trunks?
Come on! Tell me!

71
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,041
Well, we apologize.

72
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,041
[PICCOLO]
Uuh!

73
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:05,333
Yeah! We just tell him
that we're sorry. Why not?

74
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,708
And we'll give him tons of
candy and chocolate and stuff

75
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,000
as a peace offering!
Cool, huh?

76
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,666
Mm! It's a great idea!

77
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,708
Especially the part
about the candy!

78
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:17,625
Plus! It's a heck of a lot
better than Piccolo's idea!

79
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,500
What in the world are you--?

80
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,750
All right, Goten!
Go and get us some candy, pal!

81
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,750
[GOTEN]
Right!

82
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,958
[TRUNKS]
Hurry back!

83
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,416
Okay!

84
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,916
[TRUNKS]
What are you doing?

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,875
Get the candy first!

86
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,333
Yeah! But there aren't
any stores around here.

87
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,333
Hmm.
You're right. Darn it!

88
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,875
I guess we better figure out
some other way to get it, huh?

89
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,500
[GOTEN] Well, do you
think Piccolo would

90
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,416
materialize some for us?

91
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,208
[TRUNKS] I don't know!
It's worth a try!

92
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,833
[grunts] No!
It's not worth a try!

93
00:06:51,916 --> 00:07:01,750
[yawns]

94
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,333
What?

95
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,125
[GOTEN] Hey! What's the
matter with Majin Buu?

96
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,875
[TRUNKS]
I don't know.

97
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,250
Huh? Do you hear that?

98
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,250
[BOTH]
Uh!

99
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,291
[PICCOLO]
Listen!

100
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:30,708
[snoring]

101
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:35,083
Wow! He is! Isn't he... Goten?

102
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,916
I don't know.
He might be. Let's go see!

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,750
[thinking]
Is he really asleep?

104
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,875
Or is he just toying with us?

105
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Aah!

106
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,000
--[GOTEN] Come on!
--[PICCOLO] Wait!

107
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,666
We'll be right back, Piccolo!

108
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,125
Are you nuts? What in the world
do you think you're doing?

109
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,041
[GOTEN] We're seeing
if he's really asleep!

110
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,125
[TRUNKS]
Sshh! Stupid!

111
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:07,166
[SUPER BUU snoring]

112
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,583
[TRUNKS]
Come on!

113
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,250
[GOTEN]
I'm coming!

114
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,125
[snoring]

115
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,166
[BOTH scream]

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,125
[TRUNKS]
Is he awake?

117
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,458
[GOTEN] I don't know!
My eyes are closed!

118
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,416
[TRUNKS]
Let's look.

119
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,875
[GOTEN]
Okay...

120
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:45,750
[SUPER BUU snoring lightly]

121
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:46,958
He's sound asleep!

122
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,083
How can he sleep
sitting up like that?

123
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:54,041
You dummy! He's probably
faking it to trick us.

124
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,083
Oh. Right. Got it!
He's pretty sneaky.

125
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,875
But I think I can
surprise him.

126
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,083
If he's faking, we'll know.

127
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,541
Yeah! I'll just
squeeze his horn.

128
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,583
[TRUNKS] That's not
a horn. It's soft.

129
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:11,916
[GOTEN] Whatever it is
I'll just give it a little--

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,250
Aah! No!

131
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,583
[GOTEN]
Trunks, give me a boost!

132
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,583
[PICCOLO] No! No!
No boost! No boost!

133
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,916
Are you two insane?

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,250
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Huh?

135
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,500
We finally get a chance
to buy a little extra time

136
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,666
and you two
want to wake him up?

137
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,500
[PICCOLO] You two
are making me crazy!

138
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:29,916
Now listen up!

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,291
Let's use this time to
prepare for the next fusion!

140
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,958
Don't you get it?

141
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,791
It's our only chance!
Now come on!

142
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,333
--Yes, sir.
--Okay.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,375
[PICCOLO] Uhh! I'm getting
too old for this!

144
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,041
Huh?

145
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,208
[BOTH gasp]

146
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,833
[grunts]

147
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,833
[PICCOLO] What is it?
I-It's mind-boggling!

148
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,291
It's a person!

149
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,500
[GOTEN]
Yeah! Someone's coming!

150
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,791
[SUPER BUU]
Mmm...

151
00:09:58,875 --> 00:09:59,958
[PICCOLO]
But who is it?

152
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,125
I've never experienced
a power like this.

153
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,291
It's outrageously strong!

154
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,833
It could be a new enemy!
Boys! Stay close!

155
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,166
[growls]

156
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,833
[PICCOLO] What?! I don't
believe it! It's Goku!

157
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,041
No! It's my brother,
you guys! Gohan!

158
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,791
Are you positive?

159
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,916
Uh! Gohan?

160
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:51,583
[growls]

161
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,458
Hey, guys! What's happening?

162
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,833
Hey there, Gohan.

163
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,458
Hi, Gohan! What's up?

164
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,666
We all thought
that you were dead!

165
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,666
I would've been if it wasn't
for the help of Supreme Kai.

166
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,583
But that's all in the past.

167
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:15,916
I think it's time to
focus on the here and now.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,750
[growls]

169
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:21,125
[thinking] I've known you
since you were a boy, Gohan,

170
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,291
but I hardly recognize you!

171
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,541
Your face,
it's changed a little

172
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,041
and your power has
increased dramatically.

173
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,208
But that's not it,

174
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,208
it's your attitude
that's so different.

175
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,541
You're so... confident.

176
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,166
Where are the others?

177
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,000
They're all dead!
He killed them!

178
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,291
Huh? What about Dende,
is he all right?

179
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,208
Him too! Mom, Videl,
everyone Gohan!

180
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,125
[grunts]

181
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,291
[thinking] Videl!
Mother! They're gone!

182
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,166
And without Dende, we can't
wish anyone else back!

183
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,041
And they were good!

184
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,458
I turned them all
into chocolate

185
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,416
and gobbled them up!

186
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,541
[growls]

187
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,541
[thinking] Wait! It's faint

188
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,791
but I can still
sense something!

189
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,166
Just barely!

190
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,333
[SUPER BUU growls lightly]

191
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,083
[chuckles]

192
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,916
So, hot shot. You want
to fight Majin Buu?

193
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,458
Fight you?
No, I want to kill you.

194
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:19,291
All right! Now we get to see
Gohan's new powers in action!

195
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,208
He is an extraordinary man!

196
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,083
Who would have
thought that a mortal

197
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,958
could have
progressed so rapidly?

198
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,333
It is amazing! And bringing
him here was a brilliant move!

199
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:30,875
Thank you!

200
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,125
I guess my recruiting instincts
were correct, were they not?

201
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,875
Yes! Finding a man who
could remove the Z Sword

202
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,375
was remarkable in itself!

203
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,250
But when Gohan
shattered the sword

204
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,750
and released the elder Kai,

205
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,333
I realized then that we were
witnessing a living legend!

206
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,125
Yes, well,
I guess if you can't

207
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
get the job done yourself,

208
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,291
finding someone who can
is the next best thing.

209
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
But I always thought a Kai

210
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,166
should have been
the one to set me free.

211
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,458
[SUPREME KAI]
Yes, venerable elder.

212
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,166
I understand your sentiments,

213
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,958
but I think it
all worked out well.

214
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,541
After all, in my
humble opinion,

215
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,833
the planet Earth should
be protected by Earthlings,

216
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,166
don't you think?

217
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,583
I agree.

218
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:10,875
The Earth's heroes just
can't drop in from the heavens.

219
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,958
Not now. Mankind has
to learn to rely on itself.

220
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,333
No dead guy from
the history books

221
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
is going to save them either.

222
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,958
Oh! Hey, come to
think of it,

223
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,875
I guess I fall into
that category myself now!

224
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,041
[chuckles]

225
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,250
Indeed so!
Heroes should be home grown.

226
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,416
[OLD KAI] Stop twisting up the
subject, kindergarten Kai!

227
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,041
Don't you think I know that?
I'm an ancient man!

228
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,208
I don't need a lecture
from you two whippersnappers!

229
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,416
Hm!

230
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,833
[BOTH]
Uh... uh... uh...

231
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:47,291
Youths! Know-it-alls!
No proper respect!

232
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,750
[SUPREME KAI] But sir!
That's not true!

233
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:52,708
Do your best, son!

234
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,375
The Earth's future is
resting on your shoulders now.

235
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,958
[laughing]

236
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,583
I recognize you now!

237
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,208
You're one of the
ones I've beaten before.

238
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,166
So you want some more?

239
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,833
Okay. But this is
going to be the last time.

240
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,583
Humph!

241
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,083
[grunts]

242
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:46,000
[thinking] Gohan.
What are you doing?

243
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,750
We should be trying to buy
time until the next fusion.

244
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,916
Not fighting him head to head!

245
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:54,083
This is bad! We can't
just stand here, Trunks!

246
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,125
We have to help him!

247
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:59,708
But how? It's too soon
to do the fusion again!

248
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:04,250
It's worth a try! I can't
watch Gohan get killed!

249
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,708
He's my brother! I love him!

250
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,666
Goten!

251
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:14,250
Hey. Let's try
the fusion anyway.

252
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:15,916
[GOTEN]
Yeah! Thanks, Trunks!

253

I thought
you said something

279
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,583
about making me dead?

not even a Super Saiyan

286

and he's picking Buu apart!

287
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,458
A power increase
of this magnitude--

288
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,583
it--it's inconceivable!

289
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,625
Wowee! Gohan!

You can get up now.

291
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,666
I know you're not hurt.

292
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,083
Not from an attack like that.

293

He's not hurt!

it looks like Majin Buu

322

is getting his
own taste of justice!

With a steely resolve
never seen in him before,

324
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,625
Gohan is ruling the day!
