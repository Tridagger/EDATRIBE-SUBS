00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,541
The struggle
against the Saiyans

3
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,125
took a
devastating turn,

4
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:23,208
as Yamcha was bested
by the evil Saibamen.

5
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,416
And the horror
only intensified

6
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,958
as the Saiyans
themselves entered the fray!

7
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:31,333
In a desperate attempt to save
Tien from the rampaging Nappa,

8
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,291
Chiaotzu made the
ultimate sacrifice.

9
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,291
[NARRATOR] Tien would
not let his friend's

10
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,750
final effort be in vain.

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,083
Tien channeled all
of his rage and fury

12
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,916
into a powerful energy
blast aimed at Nappa.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,708
But it was no use.

14
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,416
Having spent the last of
his strength in the attack,

15
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,666
Tien collapsed while the
Saiyan remained standing.

16
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,625
No... I failed...

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,958
[NARRATOR] And though things
looked increasingly bleak

18
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,875
for our heroes,
a glimmer of hope remained!

19
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,375
Goku completed his
journey down Snake Way

20
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,791
and was transported
back to Earth by Kami,

21
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,166
where he quickly raced
to aid his friends!

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,791
But even with
all his speed,

23
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,708
Goku is still miles away
from the battlefield.

24
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,375
Can he get there before
more of his friends succumb

25
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,625
to the Saiyans?
Find out... Today!

26
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,166
Where's Kakarot?!

27
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,125
Where's that pitiful
excuse for a Saiyan hiding?!

28
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,458
[VEGETA]
What a coward...

29
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,625
Don't you say that about
my Dad! He's not a coward!

30
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,666
Come on...

31
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,791
Goku, where are you? Hurry!

32
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,500
Hang in there, guys!
I'm coming!

33
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,416
Faster, Nimbus!
Faster!

34
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,666
Until Goku arrives, it'll
be up to the three of us

35
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,083
to slow these
guys down...

36
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,208
Krillin, are you ready to
put this plan into action?

37
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:50,708
You bet! First, I distract him
by getting his attention.

38
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,041
[PICCOLO]
That's right, Krillin.

39
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,541
Then I'll come at him from
behind and grab his tail,

40
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
the Saiyan's
weak spot...

41
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,041
With any luck, he'll be
completely immobilized.

42
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,708
Then I attack him head
on and finish him!

43
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,041
All right, then...
Let's do this!

44
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,291
Heh!

45
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:13,916
Aah, secrets, secrets...

46
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,500
[NAPPA] What're you fools
whispering about over there?

47
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:21,375
That's for us to know, but
you'll find out soon enough...

48
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,625
[NAPPA] Sounds interesting...

49
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,458
Well, don't keep me
waiting too long.

50
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:29,791
The suspense
might kill me!

51
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,208
[NAPPA laughing]

52
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,458
Oh, sorry.

53
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,750
Guess I shouldn't get
your hopes up like that.

54
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,666
Not that you had any to
begin with. Hope, I mean.

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,500
It doesn't really
matter what you do.

56
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,250
You're still
gonna die!

57
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,041
Fiend!
Take this!

58
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,625
Yaahh!

59
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,333
Oh! I'm terrified!
Should I run away?

60
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,833
[KRILLIN shouting]

61
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,833
[thinking] That's it,
Krillin, keep him busy...

62
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,791
Hyaagh!

63
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:04,708
Huh?!

64
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,166
[thinking] Now!

65
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,125
Hn?

66
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:11,916
Hey! What the--?

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,750
Gohan!

68
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,541
[GOHAN screaming]

69
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,833
It worked!

70
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,583
[GOHAN continues screaming]

71
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,375
[NAPPA chuckling]

72
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,375
Give me a break...

73
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,416
Hyaah!

74
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,875
[GOHAN shouting]

75
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,708
[VEGETA chuckling]

76
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:42,041
[PICCOLO sputtering]

77
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,250
Wah, Piccolo!

78
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:46,166
[GOHAN whimpering]

79
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,000
[NAPPA] What's wrong, Namek?

80
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,833
[NAPPA laughing]

81
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,541
You look surprised!

82
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,125
Oh, now don't die on
me just yet...

83
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,375
You've still gotta tell
us about the Dragon Balls!

84
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,750
[KRILLIN] What happened?
What went wrong?

85
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,458
Piccolo had his tail!

86
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,458
Ha, ha, ha! Grab his tail!
That was your big plan?

87
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,791
Nappa and I have
evolved far beyond

88
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,958
that ridiculous
little weakness!

89
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,000
Good for us,
very bad for you!

90
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,625
One hit, and he's
supposed to be

91
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,416
one of the strongest
on this planet!

92
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,208
Piccolo?

93
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,875
Wake up!
Wake up!

94
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,083
Please, say something!
Piccolo, we need you!

95
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:34,250
Is he... Is he?

96
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,291
That's that...

97
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,166
Guess I'll have to find
someone else to play with

98
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,000
until he wakes up...
Hmm... How about you, kid?

99
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,958
[GOHAN whimpering]

100
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,750
Hmm. You know, you should
be proud. You're a Saiyan, too.

101
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,750
Well, I suppose you're
only half-Saiyan.

102
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,291
But still, that's
pretty good.

103
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,875
The Saiyans are the strongest
race in the galaxy...

104
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,250
[GOHAN whimpering]

105
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:10,416
Yep. Someday, you could've
been a mighty warrior...

106
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Someday, but
not today...

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,291
[NAPPA laughing]

108
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:18,333
[GOHAN whimpering]

109
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,375
[ROSHI] Eh! There goes
the picture again...

110
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,833
[BULMA] Oolong, do
something! Fix it!

111
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,458
Come on, you
piece of junk!

112
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,708
We wanna see what's
going on out there!

113
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,500
No use...

114
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,750
[OOLONG] What do
you mean by that?

115
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,375
They've stopped
broadcasting,

116
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,500
which means that something
has gone horribly wrong...

117
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,958
[OOLONG laughing]

118
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,166
Horribly wrong, huh?

119
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,625
Well, that's just great!
We're all gonna die!

120
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:49,541
Can it, pork rind! How
dare you give up on them?!

121
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
Huh?

122
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,458
[ROSHI] Hey! What's that
sound? Where's it coming from?

123
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,458
Uh, ChiChi, why are you...
Where did you get those guns?

124
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,791
Launch left
them behind...

125
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:11,083
I just can't stand it!
I'm going to rescue Gohan!

126
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,875
No, ChiChi, please!
Stop and think about this!

127
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,916
I'm tired of thinking!
It's time for action!

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,125
[OX KING] I'm begging you,
Chichi! Don't leave like this!

129
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,416
[CHICHI] I have to protect
him! He needs me!

130
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,208
[OX KING]Calm down!
Get a hold of yourself!

131
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,416
[CHICHI] No! I'm going!

132
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,791
[OX KING] Well, if you
won't, then I will!

133
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:32,791
What? Put-me-down-right-now!
I've got to help Gohan!

134
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,333
--[CHICHI] He needs his mother!
--[OX KING] You're only going to

135
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:35,916
--[OX KING] get in the way!
--[CHICHI] Let go of me!

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,750
[CHICHI] If anything happened to
him, I'd never forgive myself!

137
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,083
[CHICHI] What kind of
grandfather are you?!

138
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,916
[CHICHI grunting]

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,125
[CHICHI] Doesn't anybody
care? Let me go!

140
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,916
[BULMA thinking]
Just look at us.

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,166
It's hard to believe 
how happy we were then...

142
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,875
Tien... Yamcha... And my
little Goku, all grown up.

143
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,375
[BULMA thinking] I know
you're out there somewhere...

144
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,125
And I know that
no matter what,

145
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,500
you will always be
here to save us...

146
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,625
Hah! Aw, now don't tell
me you've had enough!

147
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,375
Show me your
Saiyan pride!

148
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:38,416
[GOHAN whimpering]

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,791
[GOHAN panting]

150
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,208
[thinking] I don't
know how much more

151
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,250
of this guy I can take...
Dad, where are you?

152
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,791
Ha ha ha! That's it!
Die like a man!

153
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,041
Hyaah!

154
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,250
[VEGETA laughing]

155
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,083
He's making you
look bad, Nappa!

156
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:22,458
Not for long...
He's mine!

157
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,458
[NAPPA growling]

158
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,708
Well, I guess
it's now or never...

Hnn?!

00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,666
[GOHAN whimpering]

165
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,583
[thinking] Time to see if all
that training paid off...

166
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,750
Here! Catch!

167
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,125
Destructo Disk!

168
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,083
Play catch, huh?
Why not!

169
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,791
Nappa! Don't touch it!

170
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,708
What a fool! That shot
would have sliced him in two!

171
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,291
So... close!

172
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,791
You! You cut me!

173
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,666
Oh, you've gone
and done it now!

174
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,333
You've scarred my
beautiful face!

175
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,541
And you're
gonna pay for it!

176
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,500
Here, little man!
Catch this one!

177
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,625
Hyaah!

178
00:13:55,458 --> 00:14:00,375
[KRILLIN grunting]

179
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,083
Ah! Krillin! No!

180
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,666
[NAPPA laughing]

181
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,666
Sorry!
You lose!

182
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,958
[NAPPA shouting]

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,291
What in the...
Who did that?

184
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:34,166
[NAPPA snarling]

185
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,291
You Namekian trash!

186
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,333
You think you can shoot me in
the back and get away with it?

187
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,708
How dare you!!

188
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,375
[PICCOLO] I thought
it was your face...

189
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,083
Oh! Why you...
I'm gonna...

190
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,708
[VEGETA laughing]

191
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,208
I don't know Nappa, it's
an easy enough mistake.

192
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:57,916
Bring it on! I'm tired of
you and your loud mouth!

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,375
[NAPPA]
You arrogant fool!

194
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,750
Your life is mine to
take, whenever I want!

195
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,583
The only reason you're
still breathing

196
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,666
is because we need you to
tell us about the Dragon Balls.

197
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:10,041
And once we have that, you'll
be nothing more than a memory!

198
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,541
You caught me by surprise.
It won't happen again!

199
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,500
What in the world
am I sensing?

200
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,625
There's an incredibly
huge power level

201
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,916
that's heading
straight for us!

202
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,458
It's... It's my Dad!
He's different somehow,

203
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,250
but I know
it's him!

204
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:35,666
I knew he'd save
us... Get 'em, Goku...

205
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,125
Bah! You're just
trying to distract me!

206
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:43,916
You can't sense power levels
without some sort of device...

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Afraid you're
wrong.

208
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,333
You're
bluffing!

209
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:53,041
Oh? Wait and see.

210
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,541
[thinking] Goku, they can't
hold out much longer!

211
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,583
You've got to hurry!

212
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,708
It's Goku,
all right!

213
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,666
He's on his way
here right now!

214
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,166
And judging by the
power I'm sensing,

215
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,541
you Saiyans are in store for
the fight of your lives!

216
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,083
Wow! This is great!

217
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:13,666
I knew my Dad would make it
here in time! Hurry up, Daddy!

218
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,416
Yes. I love it!

219
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,541
You're all a bunch of
liars! Where is he?

220
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,750
I don't see
anyone! Vegeta!

221
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,500
Whadda you think? Is Kakarot
really coming or not?

222
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:34,208
Calm down, Nappa! Certainly,
there's nothing to worry about!

223
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:38,083
Who cares anyway?
Let him come!

224
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:47,666
I feel two huge
power levels...

225
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,000
Two weaker ones...
One fading...

226
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:56,958
That only makes five. Something
terrible is happening!

227
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,250
Haah! Go, Nimbus! Hurry!

228
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,375
[NAPPA] Vegeta!
Hey, Vegeta!

229
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,958
Snap out of it!

230
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,791
You look like you've
seen a ghost or something!

231
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,375
[NAPPA laughing]

232
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,583
Come on! Don't tell me
there some sort of truth

233
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,833
to what these
fools are saying!

234
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,333
Something is definitely
headed this way.

235
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,666
But it can't
be Kakarot.

236
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,666
The power level's
too high...

237
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,625
Whatever is coming has a
power level of five-thousand.

238
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,958
What?! No way!
Five thousand?!

239
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,375
[VEGETA thinking] There's no
way that could be Kakarot!

240
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,166
How could he have
become so powerful?

241
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,833
Well, whatever it is, I have
to be prepared for anything.

242
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,000
The people of this
planet have ways

243
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,541
of hiding their
true power levels.

244
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,666
Five thousand could just
be the beginning.

245
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,375
It can't be! Your scouter
must be malfunctioning!

246
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:03,708
[PICCOLO laughing]

247
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,333
[PICCOLO] So then, you
still think I'm bluffing?

248
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,000
Nappa! Quickly!
Kill them all!

249
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,250
We can't let them join
with this fighter!

250
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,416
If it is Kakarot,
he has to know

251
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,750
that we will not be
opposed by anyone!

252
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,625
Huh?!

253
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:19,875
Uwaah!

254
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,666
[KRILLIN growling]

255
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,333
[NAPPA] But... what
about the Dragon Balls?

256
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,958
[VEGETA] We don't need
these fools to find them!

257
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,833
It's all becoming
clear to me now!

258
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,208
It must have
been the Nameks

259
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,500
who created the Dragon Balls
here on this planet...

260
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,166
I've heard of the Magic
Balls of Namek before,

261
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,083
but I'd always thought
they were just a legend!

262
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,541
It can't just be a coincidence
that while searching

263
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,375
for these Dragon Balls,
we find a Namek!

264
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,791
I get it!

265
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,333
A Namekian is all we need
to make the Dragon Balls,

266
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,875
and Planet Namek is
loaded with them!

267
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,791
And if this one doesn't
want to cooperate,

268
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:56,458
we can always find another
Namekian that will!

269
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,541
So you're...
expendable!

270
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,208
Hey! Piccolo!
Leave now!

271
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,208
I can take care of
this bully by myself

272
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,791
until my Dad
gets here!

273
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,166
What?

274
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,750
If we lose you, then the
Dragon Balls will disappear

275
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,083
and we won't be
able to wish

276
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,708
any of our friends
back to life!

277
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,916
Thanks for your
concern, Gohan,

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,333
but I really don't think you
can handle these guys alone...

279
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,708
Just for that...
you go first.

280
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,416
I need to
help them...

281
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:41,000
But how? I can barely
move... Piccolo... Gohan!

282
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,416
[GOHAN growling]

283
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay, brat!
You die!

284
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,125
Raahh!

285
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,166
[GOHAN whimpering]

286
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,916
Raagh!

287
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,583
Haah!

288
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,708
Hnn?!

289
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:17,083
[PICCOLO]
I don't believe it...

290
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:25,000
Uh, Gohan...
Was... was that you?

291
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,833
[NAPPA snarling]

292
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:58,458
You!
I'll kill you!

293
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,041
[NAPPA screaming]

294
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:05,708
[NAPPA growling]

295
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:09,208
[GOHAN whimpering]

296
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,125
Oh, no...

297
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,208
It's time...

298
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,333
[NAPPA growling]

299
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,750
[GOHAN whimpering]

300
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:29,583
[NAPPA shouting]

301
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:35,208
[GOHAN wailing]

302
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,625
[KRILLIN groaning]

303
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,666
Where am I?
Where's my dad?

304
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,208
This is... sour...

305
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,208
[GOHAN chuckling]

306
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:57,083
[PICCOLO thinking] Gohan!
No! No!

307
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:01,416
Until now, training
you was out of vengence,

308
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,333
making you worthy enough
to be my opponent.

309
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,750
But... something's changed...

310
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:10,208
No matter what happens
to you, Gohan,

311
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,958
I will always be
there to protect you.

312
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:18,250
[NAPPA yelling]

313
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,333
[GOHAN screaming]

314
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,791
[PICCOLO growling]

315
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,500
[GOHAN screaming]

316
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,375
Hrgh!

317
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,791
[PICCOLO screaming]

318
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,000
[NARRATOR] Has Piccolo made the
ultimate sacrifice for Gohan

319
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,750
by throwing himself in the path
of Nappa's furious attack?

320
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,416
Will Goku arrive
in time

321
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,583
to save his remaining friends
from the diabolical Saiyans?

322
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,791
And even if he does,
what chance does he have

323
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,875
of saving the rest
of the planet?

324
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:52,250
Find out, on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
