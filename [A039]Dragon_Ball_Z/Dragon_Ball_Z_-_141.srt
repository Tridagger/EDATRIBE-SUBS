00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,625
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,041
Gohan stumbled upon
the discarded shell

3
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,708
of a mysterious creature,

4
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,000
the likes of which
he had never seen before!

5
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,083
But where in the world
did it come from?

6
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,291
...what hatched out of the shell

7
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,916
we found in the time capsule.

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,041
Right. It grew up and
then molted out of its skin...

9
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,458
you think?

10
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,958
It's still wet...

11
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,250
This thing must be
somewhere close.

12
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,666
[NARRATOR] This vile
monstrosity is on the loose,

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,541
lurking about the countryside.

14
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,958
But did it really
come from the future?

15
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,291
And for what sinister purpose?

16
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,250
While Trunks and the others
contemplate the answers

17
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,750
to these questions,
elsewhere, trouble is afoot!

18
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,250
[NARRATOR] It's the Androids!

19
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,250
And their quest to find
Goku is almost complete.

20
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,541
Meanwhile,
Kami looked on in horror

21
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,125
as the tensions built
on the earth below.

22
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,000
A terrible new evil
is about to be unleashed!

23
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,041
It there anyone
who can stop it?

24
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,250
Find out today!

25
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,416
[GOHAN] Hey, Trunks...

26
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,583
[GOHAN] Earth to Trunks!

27
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,458
Huh? Yeah?!

28
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,625
[GOHAN] Do you have any idea
what kind of a creature

29
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,083
that might have been back there?

30
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,125
Nope. Afraid not.
But whatever it was,

31
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,041
it was just about
the ugliest thing

32
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,875
that I've ever seen!

33
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:51,625
[GOHAN]
Man, you're not kidding!

34
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,875
That thing almost
made me sick to my stomach!

35
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,166
--[TRUNKS chuckles]
--[GOHAN] Yuck!

36
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,916
[GOHAN] Hey, you said that
it probably got here

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,708
four years ago, right?

38
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,791
[TRUNKS] Yeah. At least
that's what the indicator

39
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,666
in the time capsule read before
the batteries went dead. Why?

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,333
[GOHAN] I just find it
hard to believe that

41
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,500
a creature like that could
be here for four whole years

42
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,375
without anyone noticing it!

43
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:14,750
I mean, doesn't that seem
a little bit weird to you?

44
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,416
Yeah.

45
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
But what I want to know is...

46
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,250
who sent it here
and for what reason?

47
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:32,166
[birds chripping]

48
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,958
[thinking] Really...
How long does it take her

49
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:42,458
to pick out
a new dress, anyway?

50
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,500
So this is the best
outfit in your store?

51
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:58,000
Yup! You won't find
better n' that, li'l lady!

52
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,458
[ANDROID 18] Hmph!

53
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,291
Well... now how do you like it?

54
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,875
[ANDROID 18]
How do you think I like it?

55
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,666
It's grotesque!
But I guess I can't expect

56
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,375
to find much better
in a hick town like this.

57
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:16,041
[ANDROID 18] It'll just
have to do. Take care, now.

58
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,041
Hey! You can't leave
here without paying?!

59
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,708

[TV REPORTER A] And now,
Channel 8's continuing coverage

80
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,291
of the disaster in Gingertown...

81
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,916
To recap the situation,

82
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,416
all activities in the
West City suburb of Gingertown

83
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,250
came to a screeching
halt this morning

84
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,875
when the entire population
mysteriously vanished

85
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,416
into thin air.

86
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,166
Authorities are at a loss to
explain the sudden disappearance

87
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,833
of Gingertown's inhabitants,
and attempts at contacting

88
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:39,958
anyone within the city itself
have so far gone unanswered.

89
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,500

00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,666

we found the time machine.

Did Gohan and Trunks
show up there yet?

No, no sign
of them so far...

100
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,166

Uh, you sound
all wigged out Bulma.

00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,083
Listen, Krillin.
Turn your TV on to Channel 8.

And hurry, because there's
something on right now

really gonna want to see...

I thought they were
just showing reruns.

110

It's Bulma.
She wants us to...

111
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,833
watch something on TV...

112
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,083
Why? Is she
gonna be on a show?

113
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,125
Yeah, and now she
wants us to watch

114
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,458
so she can brag about
how famous she is!

115
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,750
[laughs] Probably...

116
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,958
Well... it looks like
we have more details

117
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,416
on the "Crisis in Gingertown."

118

Our latest reports
indicate that there are

119
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,750
no signs of life anywhere.

120
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,208
However, it seems the
clothing of the victims

121
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,458
has been discovered
throughout the city...

Wait! Our Channel 8 reporter

123

at the scene...!

What... is goin'... on?!

125
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,791
Ah... I'm reporting "live" from

126
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:15,083
downtown Gingertown
and the entire place

127
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,708
is completely deserted!
All of the 15,000 residents

128
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,875
have suddenly... disappeared!

129
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
Fifteen thousand...?

130
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,375
Piles of garments lie
scattered throughout the city,

131
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:26,583
as though these people were

132
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,166
sucked right
out of their clothes!

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,625

There are also indications that

134
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,833
these people may have been
trying to defend themselves

00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,541
against someone...

Man. This is really bad!

It's... the Androids!
They must've done this!

140
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,875
I doubt that...

141
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,166
Huh?

142
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,083
And I've got a feeling
that Gohan and Trunks

143
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,958
are going to agree with me.

144
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,416
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me this has

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,833
something to do with that
other time machine you found!

146
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,791
That's getting a little
too weird for me!

147
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,083
[BULMA] Well, weird or not,
Krillin, I know it's true!

148
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,541
When Gohan and Trunks show up,

149
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,208
tell them what
I've told you, all right?

150

[KRILLIN] You got it.
