00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:20,041
Babidi set into motion another
one of his sinister schemes.

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,416
The wizard's plan:

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,125
to draw Piccolo, Trunks,
and Goten out of hiding

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,250
and feed him to the
monster Majin Buu.

6
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,541
But to draw them out,
he would first need some bait.

7
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:39,916
[PEOPLE gasping, screaming]

8
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,416
[BUU]
Aaahh...

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,875
Buu want candy!

10
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,333
[NARRATOR]
At Babidi's command,

11
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,458
Majin Buu used his power to
turn the unsuspecting citizens

12
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,208
of an entire city into candy.

13
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,208
Then, like a
vile vacuum cleaner,

14
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,000
he devoured the population
in a single gruesome gulp.

15
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,750
[NARRATOR]
How much more of this horror

16
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,291
can our heroes bear to witness

17
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,208
before they are
forced out of hiding?

18
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,875
And how many more victims
will Buu have to devour

19
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,541
before he satisfies
his evil appetite?

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,916
You'll have to
watch to find out!

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,083
[BABIDI]
Please be courteous

22
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,541
and remember that
silence is golden, okay?

23
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:57,125
[BABIDI] Aww,
look at that. What a shame.

24
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:01,208
This city is completely useless
if there are no people in it.

25
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,125
[BUU]
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

26
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:07,375
Let's fix that! All these old
buildings are spoiling my view.

27
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Go ahead, Majin Buu.
Clean up this town.

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,625
Just don't overdo it.

29
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,125
We wouldn't want the whole
planet to disappear!

30
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,541
[BABIDI laughs]

31
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,291
Okay! Okay!

32
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:19,791
Ooh!

33
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,041
Darn it, he's made
his point already.

34
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,291
Now he's just rubbing
it in our faces.

35
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,791
[BABIDI giggles]

36
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,875
[BUU]
Puuu!

37
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,625
[BABIDI giggles]

38
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,708
[BUU giggles]

39
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,958
[BABIDI giggles]

40
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:43,291
That's more like it.

41
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,375
It's what I'll do to
those three meddlers, too.

42
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,208
So one last reminder.

43
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,791
It's him...

44
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,333
...and him...

45
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,916
...and him!

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,291
There's really no point
in protecting them.

47
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,916
They are not your friends.

48
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
They are spineless cowards!

49
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,166
If they valued
your lives at all,

50
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,416
they would have already
turned themselves over to me.

51
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,083
Obviously, they don't.
Well, shame on them, I say!

52
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,166
You now have an
opportunity to teach

53
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,250
these selfish brats a lesson.

54
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,291
One chance to stand up
for your self-worth

55
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,875
and for Earthlings everywhere.

56
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,375
[BABIDI using ESP]
It's simple really.

57
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,041
Just tell me where they are.

58
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,916
By the way...

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,041
You have five days to
measure the importance

60
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,583
of your meager, little lives.

61
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:35,916
Take too long, and I'll
have Buu annihilate you all!

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
[giggles]

63
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,166
[growls]

64
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,958
Piccolo.

65
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,416
Stay calm.
Don't let him get to you!

66
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,166
Oh yes, there's one
more important thing.

67
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,208
You will need to contact me,
so I'll tell you how you can.

68
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,291
If you have some information
for me, I can hear you...

69
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,291
Start talking and I'll
hear you inside my head.

70
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,291
I'm listening, so speak up now!

71
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,291
If you tell me where those
uncaring louts are hiding

72
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,291
I might even spare you!

73
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,250
I'm sure they're
all here on the list!

74
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,208
Find them! If we don't,
we'll all be turned into candy

75
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:23,166
and eaten by that monster!

76
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,541
Somebody has got to know where
those three guys are?!

77
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:28,375
Nobody knows where they're
hiding! We're all done for!

78
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,208
Somebody's gotta do something!

79
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,666
I know I'm sweet, but I don't
wanna turn into candy!

80
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,541
[shrieks]

81
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,958
How do you think I feel?

82
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,333
I've had my nose buried
in these books for a year.

83
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,541
A whole year, trying to
get into a college

84
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,375
that just got blown up.

85
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,583
Whatta jip! I coulda
been at the beach!

86
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,041
You think that's bad,
our wedding is tomorrow!

87
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,916
And ever since
I was a little girl

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,791
I've dreamed of my wedding day.

89
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,958
You're not getting out
of this that easy! Ah!

90
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,833
Ow! Sorry sweetheart!

91
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
[BUU giggles]

92
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:05,083
Oh! Someone's already
trying to contact me.

93
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:08,791
[FRIAR A] Uh, hello, Mister
Babidi, sir, I was, uh...

94
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,125
I'm in charge of the World
Martial Arts Tournament

95
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,250
that was held e-earlier today.

96
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,375
[BABIDI]
Mm-hmm. I hear you.

97
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,166
U-Uh, those three guys...

98
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:20,125
They were all participants
in, uh, the competition!

99
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,666
[BABIDI using ESP] Excellent!
Are you sure it's them?

100
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,708
Ah, oh! Their
names are Goten...

101
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:32,416
And there's Trunks... And
Majunior... Yes, that's them!

102
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,083
--Please don't kill me!
--Listen, I don't care

103
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:37,083
about their names.
Just tell me where to find them!

104
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,375
[BUU]
Whee!

105
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,333
[FRIAR A] Uh, I don't know
where they are, sir!

106
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:44,416
You don't know, huh?
Then you're useless to me!

107
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,125
Ahh! I'm... sorry.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,666
[screams]

109
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,375
--[screaming continues]
--[whimpers]

110
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,958
[FRIAR B]
Aaah! No! Marvin!

111
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,291
[sobs]

112
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,625
Now, don't give me anymore
useless information.

113
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,750
Give me what I want or else!

114
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,958
I can't stand this!

115
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,125
No rest for the wicked!

116
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,250
I've got to keep you
humans on your toes,

117
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,166
so perhaps a little
more destruction

118
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,291
will keep you all in line.

119
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,916
Majin Buu! It's time to go!

120
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,750
[BABIDI] You never know,
the next place we visit

121
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,625
may be your hometown.

122
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes, you can consider this
to be your last warning.

123
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,208
Remember, you have
only five days left

124
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,208
before we tear
this planet apart!

125
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:43,416
Come on, give me a call!

126
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,583
[BUU giggles]

127
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,500
[snarls]
Curse him!

128
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,166
That demented wizard!

129
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,708
We've got to stop them!

130
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,583
I don't know if
they can be stopped!

131
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,250
So! Those are the ones
that took Gohan

132
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,208
and Vegeta away from us?!
[growls]

133
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,583
Yeah...

134
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,916
Vegeta, Gohan,
all those people...

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,625
And unless we do
something quickly,

136
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,875
for the next five days, that
list will keep on growing.

137
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,375
There's no way I can allow that
to happen. I'll show myself!

138
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,500
No! That won't help anybody.
And you know it, Piccolo.

139
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,833
[GOKU] Babidi's going to
wipe everyone out,

140
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,375
no matter what you do.

141
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,791
Stay. Help me teach Goten and
Trunks the fusion technique.

142
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,750
That is the only way
we can truly put an end

143
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,166
to this nightmare.

144
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,375
We have five days before the
Earth is history. We can do it!

145
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,208
Look, I know it's hard
to sit here doing nothing

146
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,083
while he's out there
hurting so many people,

147
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,625
but you said it yourself.

148
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,208
We have to be prepared to cope
with anything that happens.

149
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,291
Don't worry, okay? We can still
revive Majin Buu's victims

150
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:03,250
with the Dragon Balls.
So, just hang in there!

151
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,208
Yes, he's right, Piccolo.

152
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,375
Don't leave! Not when you
could still do some good here!

153
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,916
I'll stay.

154
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,166
[TRUNKS]
Huh?!

155
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,500
Huh? Hey, where am I?

156
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,416
[TRUNKS]
Whoaa...

157
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:55,750
What a place.
What is this? Hey! Goten!

158
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,166
Get up! Goten! Come on, get up!

159
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:07,125
Darn! Dumb kid
sleeps like a rock.

160
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,583
I know! Hey, Goten.
Get up, it's time to eat!

161
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
--[TRUNKS chuckles]
--[gasps]

162
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,958
Yeah! Let's eat!

163
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,291
Huh? Huh? Food?

164
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,750
[TRUNKS]
Why do you even have ears?

165
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,166
You hear much better
with your stomach.

166
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,208
Huh? What did you say?
Where is this?

167
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,750
Uh... I don't know? You tell me.

168
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,541
[GOTEN]
I don't know. It's sure nice!

169
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Oh, hey! That plate
looks expensive!

170
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,333
Who cares about that? I want
to know what we're doing here.

171
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,583
[gasps] Where's my dad?

172
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
Oh yeah! We were with him.

173
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,333
That's right!

174
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,250
[VEGETA] Trunks. There's
something you must know.

175
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,958
You've made me proud, my son.

176
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,541
[TRUNKS grunts]

177
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,791
What did you do to him?!

178
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,250
Why did you do it?! Tell me!

179
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,375
Why did you do that to Trunks?!

180
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,958
[GOTEN grunts]

181
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:17,416
So then, he... isn't here?

182
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,041
But I... I think we should
check this place out.

183
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,500
[GOTEN]
Mm-hmm.

184
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,625
[TRUNKS]
This place is huge!

185
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,583
It looks like
there's nobody home!

186
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,916
Hey, hold on?
Where have those boys gone?

187
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,291
Kibito, revive
Gohan with your power.

188
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,041
[gasps]

189
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,708
Whoa! What the...?

190
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:08,166
[GOHAN]
Supreme Kai? Where... are we?

191
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,166
It's my world.
It's the World of the Kais.

192
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,708
This is where you live?

193
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:19,416
Well I, uh, guess this
means I'm dead, doesn't it?

194
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,666
Hey, I don't get a
halo like my dad has?

195
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,458
No. Now don't worry.

196
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,166
You were in bad shape,
but you're alive.

197
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,250
'Kay... But if I'm not dead,
then what am I doing here?

198
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,541
You are asking too many
questions of the Supreme Kai!

199
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,708
You should try to
be more respectful.

200
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,000
You are a guest here.

201
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,833
No living mortal has
ever stood on this ground.

202
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,041
Oh! So then I
really did die, I guess?

203
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,208
And that's why I'm here?

204
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,083
Huh? Gohan, you're alive!

205
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:57,250
But I don't know why you are
here. It is very strange.

206
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,541
It is very strange indeed!

207
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,208
[GOHAN] Then what's wrong
with asking a few questions?

208
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,000
Supreme Kai, what's going on?

209
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,583
[KIBITO]
I am also puzzled, Master.

210
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,958
It's not right! Gohan does not
belong in a place like this!

211
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:16,500
I brought Gohan here
to get the Z sword!

212
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,875
It's the only way that
Majin Buu can be defeated now.

213
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,958
[gasps] The Z sword?!

214
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,125
You-You can't be
serious, Supreme Kai?!

215
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,000
How can a mere Earthling do what
the Kais themselves could not?!

216
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,791
Don't you remember?!

217
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,166
None of the Kais, not even you,

218
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,083
were capable of
freeing the Z sword!

219
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,208
I'm aware of the
power of the Z sword.

220
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,291
And I'm certain that Gohan is
the right person to wield it.

221
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,166
Uh? What's the Z Sword?

222
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,500
Master! Please! Have you
really thought this through?!

223
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
There's no harm
in trying, Kibito!

224
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,500
Let's go! Gohan! Come with me!

225
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,916
[GOHAN] Wait, aren't you going
to tell me what the Z sword is?

226
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,375
Guess not...

227
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:12,791
He won't pull the Z sword from
that rock! I guarantee it!

228
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,208
[GOTEN]
This is really good, Trunks!

229
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:26,125
Where are they? Piccolo,
your dad, where are they?

230
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:30,833
Goten, don't you know it's rude
to talk with your mouth full?

231
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,166
Your manners are really bad.
You shouldn't talk,

232
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,375
when you're eating.

233
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,333
I'm sorry...

234
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,708
Ah, that's okay.

235
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:40,875
[MR. POPO]
Ah! There you are!

236
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,875
[BOTH]
Huh?

237
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,166
Well, I see you found the food.

238
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,708
[screams] Ow! Let go of me!
We didn't do anything wrong!

239
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,208
I-It was just sitting here!

240
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,708
If you wanted it so bad, you
should have got here first!

241
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,250
Hey! Hands off, buddy!
Goten, what are you doing?!

242
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,833
This is no time to be
stuffing your face!

243
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:06,541
Hold on, Trunks. Please be
quiet till I finish my meal.

244
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,166
[growls, screams]

245
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,416
[GOTEN] You were the one that
said it was bad manners

246
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,250
to talk when a person
was eating, remember?

247
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,750
If you want to see bad manners,
then you've got it!

248
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,250
My, even Goku wasn't that
powerful when he was a boy!

249
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,000
Hey, let's go!

250
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:27,625
[GOTEN]
Okay!

251
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,250
[MR. POPO]
Hold it!

252
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,708
Let's get him!

253
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,583
[MR. POPO grunts]

254
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,375
Hey, Goten! Get out of here!

255
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,833
Right!

256
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,791
[TRUNKS]
Huh...?

257
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,583
--[GOTEN grunts]
--[MR. POPO whimpers]

258
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,750
Yeah-heah! Good work!

259
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,750
[GOKU]
You two! Stay right there!

260
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,083
It's Dad!

261
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,625
Oh boy...

262
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,166
[MR. POPO] Those boys certainly
have a lot of energy, Goku!

263
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,833
Well! I guess I'll have to get
them to work it off, won't I?

264
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,833
By teaching them
the fusion technique!

265
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,291
[BOTH]
Hmm?

266
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,000
What a view!
You know, in a lot of ways

267
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,583
this reminds me of
where I live back on Earth!

268
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,416
[growls]

269
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,000
Look at you!
This is a sacred place

270
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,000
and you're dressed like that!

271
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,458
[gasps]

272
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,375
[laughs]

273
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,708
Those clothes suit
you well, Gohan.

274
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,333
Ya think so? Thanks!

275
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,916
Ah, this is it. We're here!

276
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,291
Uh?

277
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:27,125
[SUPREME KAI]
This is the Z sword, Gohan.

278
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,958
Now try to pull it out.

279
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,541
No one else has done it.

280
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,500
Gohan, if you can pull it from
the rock, you will be the first.

281
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,791
[GOHAN]
Whoa... The first one, huh?

282
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,250
You know, this
might sound strange,

283
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,458
but I feel like
I've done this before.

284
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,083
[TRUNKS]
What?! No, that can't be!

285
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,250
That could never
happen to my dad!

286
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,833
No way! No!

287
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,458
[wails]

288
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,083
My brother is not dead!

289
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,875
[sobs]

290
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,541
Stop that! We don't
have time for this now!

291
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,166
We've got a lot of work to do

292
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,041
and you'll have to learn some
new skills fast! You got it?!

293
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:20,541
[BOTH sob, whimper]

294
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,166
[GOKU]
I know that might seem harsh,

295
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,125
but there's a chance Babidi
could find this place!

296
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,833
So I want both of you to
start practicing right away!

297
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,666
What about the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber?

298
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,958
No, that room can only be
used twice in a lifetime.

299
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,958
I'm sure in the future we're
going to have to use it again.

300
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,208
We'll be just fine.

301
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,791
If I'm right about these two,

302
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,291
they should be able to master
the fusion technique in no time.

303
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,958
Now let's begin!

304
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,666
[BOTH whimper]

305
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,541
You'll have to learn this
pretty quick, too, Piccolo.

306
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,750
Good luck, you guys...
You're gonna need it.

307
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,291
[BOTH whimper]

308
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:13,083
I said stop that! There'll be
no more tears from now on!

309
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,416
You will have to be tough
to stop Majin Buu!

310
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,958
[NARRATOR] The news that
Gohan and Vegeta were victims

311
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,666
of Majin Buu hit
Trunks and Goten hard.

312
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,541
Now, they must
swallow their pain

313
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,875
and channel all of
their energies

314
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,125
into learning
the fusion technique.

315
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,000
Little do they know,
Gohan is in the other world

316
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,125
preparing for a
challenge of his own.

317
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,083
He's got to free the legendary
Z Sword from its resting place,

318
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,291
a feat no one before him
has ever accomplished.

319
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,833
Time is running out.

320
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:50,250
In five days, Majin Buu
will destroy the planet.

321
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,333
Can these three
warriors save the day?

322
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,250
Find out on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
