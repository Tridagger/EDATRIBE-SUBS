00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,666
Mr. Satan was plotting
to blow up Majin Buu

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,750
and become the
savior of the world!

4
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:20,916
[MR. SATAN] I'm not
quite finished cooking

5
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,291
your dinner yet, sir.

6
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,916
[NARRATOR]
But when his target returned

7
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,125
with a newly found
friend in distress,

8
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,041
Mr. Satan discovered a
compassionate side of Buu

9
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,958
and decided to make an appeal.

10
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,500
Why do you
keep flying around, uh,

11
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:36,416
ya know, killing people and
destroying all of our cities?

12
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,083
Buu was told to.

13
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,458
Watch football.

14
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,791
Anything as long as it
doesn't involve destruction!

15
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,750
Hm?

16
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,333
Ah! I'm just kidding!

17
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,750
You can do whatever
you want to the world!

18
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,958
Just don't hurt me!

19
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,708
Is to kill people a bad thing?

20
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,458
Yes, it is a bad thing.

21
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,958
Then no more.

22
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,333
Huh?!

23
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,500
You're not going to
kill people any more?

24
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,833
[BUU]
Mhmm!

25
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,000
[MR. SATAN] And you won't
destroy any more cities?

26
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,083
[BUU]
Mhmm!

27
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,083
[MR. SATAN thinking]
I did it!

28
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,833
I got this guy to
change his ways

29
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,541
and I didn't have to throw
a punch or blow him up!

30
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,375
Oh, Mr. Satan,
you are truly the greatest!

31
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,500
[NARRATOR]
But just as soon as Buu's heart

32
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,625
began to be softened by
the love of his new friend,

33
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,416
tragedy struck when
a deranged madman

34
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,208
ended the puppy's life in
a senseless act of hatred!

35
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,250
[gasps]

36
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,791
Ohhh!

37
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,416
[NARRATOR] It was the end of
a new beginning for Majin Buu!

38
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:51,916
[MR. SATAN thinking]
Good heavens! This is terrible!

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Who did this?

40
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,375
[growls]

41
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,833
[SMITTY laughs]

42
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:03,666
A Bull's eye!

43
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,375
How could they? Fools!
It was just a pup!

44
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,375
I-I'm sorry, Majin Buu!

45
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:17,708
Hm! Hey!
Yes, now I'm sure of it!

46
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,625
That's the World Champion
standing next to him, all right!

47
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,708
I'm positive!

48
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,166
But what would a
hero like Mr. Satan

49
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,875
be doing palling
around with Buu?

50
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,625
[VAN ZANT]
Trophy hunting no doubt!

51
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,583
The same as us, my old friend!

52
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,916
But Mr. Satan's not
getting the glory this time.

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,583
No sir-ee! That's the
joy of Armageddon, Smitty.

54
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,916
[VAN ZANT]
Everyone gets their turn.

55
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,000
[VAN ZANT]
Fire!

56
00:04:57,666 --> 00:05:00,791
[cackles]

57
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:05,375
[VAN ZANT]
Yeah! Hahaha! Yeah!!

58
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:10,833
I did it! Yes!
The trophy is mine!

59
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,000
Remarkable! My word!

60
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,166
I've just stopped
the world from ending!

61
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,875
Guess that means more time
to have my fun! Ha, ha, ha!

62
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:23,125
[SMITTY] Ah! Look! In the
smoke! Someone's there!

63
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,458
[VAN ZANT] Stop being paranoid,
you old fool! Where?

64
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:28,000
There!

65
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,458
[VAN ZANT]
Huh?

66
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:46,000
What? I missed! But how
could I...? I shot right at him!

67
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:54,083
[BUU growls]

68
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,625
[gasping]

69
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:13,208
[SMITTY] He... He's coming!
What are we going to do?

70
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,916
[VAN ZANT] We're going
to kill him, you fool!

71
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,875
[SMITTY screams]

72
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,000
Huh?!

73
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:23,208
[VAN ZANT]
Idiot! What the heck happened?!

74
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,375
[MR. SATAN]
I happened!

75
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,000
What? You! Darn you!

76
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,666
[growls]

77
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,041
Go ahead! Pick it up!

78
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,416
Now it's your turn!

79
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,125
There! Hyaaaa!

80
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,416
[MR. SATAN] You! How could you?
It was just a little puppy!

81
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,083
You killed a little puppy!

82
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,458
You tried to kill us, too!

83
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,125
[pants]

84
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,500
Heartless monster!

85
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,916
Poor guy!
You didn't deserve this!

86
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,416
Majin Buu, quick!
He's still alive! Hurry!

87
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,000
Huh? Buu come!

88
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,791
He moved!

89
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,583
[BUU]
Buu here.

90
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:59,333
Can you help him? Like before?

91
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,166
[BUU]
Buu try! Try help pup!

92
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,875
[MR. SATAN] Yes! He's alive!
Ha, ha, ha! You did it, Buu!

93
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,416
You did it! He's alive!

94
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,125
[BUU] Buu do!! Buu do!

95
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:37,625
[BOTH] Buu do! Buu do!
Buu do! Buu do!...

96
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,416
[PICCOLO] I don't get it, Dende.
It doesn't make sense.

97
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,708
What's that show-boat
Mr.Satan doing

98
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,208
hanging around with Majin Buu?

99
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,333
Well making friends!

100
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,291
Hey, maybe Buu will
change if he has a friend!

101
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,250
Maybe we won't have
to fight him after all!

102
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,708
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

103
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,333
I don't like Mr. Satan!

104
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,875
But I don't want
him to get hurt!

105
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:09,958
He's in grave danger!

106
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,291
[barking]

107
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,208
[MR. SATAN] That a boy! Get the
ball.

108
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,916
Bring it back! Ah, good puppy!

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,750
Yeah! Aren't you smart!
Yes, you are!

110
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,791
Ahhh! Buu finish house!

111
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:32,541
[MR. SATAN] Oh, my goodness!
What a work of art!

112
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:35,166
That's incredible, Buu! Really!

113
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,291
Buu make house like Bee!

114
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,333
Aw, you named him Bee?!

115
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,750
[BUU] Buu pat-pat! Make house!
Buu make room for you, too!

116
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,541
[MR. SATAN]
Oh, really? Thank you!

117
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,291
[BUU]
Look! House for Bee!

118
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,458
[MR. SATAN]
Hey! He likes it!

[INSTRUCTOR]
Okay, girls! Here we go!

123
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,791
One and kick and two
and kick and three and kick!

124
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,333
That's it! Stretch it out!

[INSTRUCTOR] Up, down! Up, down!
Up, down! That's it ladys!

128
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,375
Now you're doing it!
Okay, up, down, stop!

[OLD KAI cackles]

130
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,916
[GOHAN thinking]
This is absurd! What a kook!

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,416
Heh? You know!

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,916
When people succeed,
they're geniuses,

133
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,791
until then, they're kooks!

134
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:41,125
Huh?!

135
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,958
Look, I told you that
the awakening process

136
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,541
would take twenty
hours, didn't I?

137
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:49,583
And has it been
twenty hours yet?

138
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,625
Well, has it?

139
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:51,833
[GOHAN]
Uh-uh.

140
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,083
Shall we continue?

141
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,791
[GOHAN]
Mhmm.

142
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,166
Now!

143
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,500
Huh?

144
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,541
[OLD KAI] Tell me a little
about this Bulma lady!

145
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,458
I hope that she isn't
too old now, is she?

146
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,666
Well, as long as she's
got plenty of spunk left,

147
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,375
she'll do for me!

148
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,791
After being trapped
in that sword,

149
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,791
I'll settle for
just about anything!

150
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,666
Know what I mean? Hehehehe!

151
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,250
I know what you mean!

152
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,916
But don't you think we should
concentrate on the task at hand?

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,041
[OLD KAI]
Concentrate? How dare you!

154
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,916
What, you don't
think a Supreme Kai can

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,166
attend to a small matter like
this without losing his focus?

156
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,541
Concentrate? You're the one
who needs to concentrate!

157
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,875
So, what's she like?

158
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:36,333
Well, she's very beautiful!

159
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:38,125
Hm? Oh! I see!

160
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,750
But you shouldn't
be talking like this,

161
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,541
it's slowing down the process!

162
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,500
We must finish soon!

163
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,333
Yes! That way I can get my kiss!

164
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:56,500
Oh, my! He's putting Gohan
through the ringer, isn't he?

165
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,333
Well, I guess!

166
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,708
[SUPREME KAI]
It must be working! Excellent!

[MR. SATAN]
Uh, oh! Don't eat him, Bee!

170
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:14,166

[MR. SATAN thinking]
This is too good to be true!

172
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:24,333
Buu is like a little child!
He just needed a good friend!

173
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:27,375
That's me! Uh, huh!
The good friend!

00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,541
[BEE barking]

175
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,916
[BUU]
Yeee! Help! Bee eat Buu!

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,416
[MR. SATAN]
Hey! Hold on! Here it comes!

177
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,416
[chuckles]

178
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,583
Uh! Oh...

179
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,666
[MR. SATAN]
Here we go!

180
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,791
Uh, don't mind the
curly black things, boys!

181
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,750
It's my, uh, special spice!

182
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,000
[BUU]
Will you eat with Buu?

183
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:51,875
Huh? Uh, yeah! Sure!

184
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,541
[PICCOLO]
And where have you two been?

185
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,708
[TRUNKS]
Uhhh... What do you mean?

186
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,833
We went to fight Buu! Remember?

187
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,291
[PICCOLO]
I told you to come back

188
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,791
as soon as your
fusion dissolved!

189
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,000
But we're here! We came back!

190
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,625
Fusion lasts for
about a half an hour

191
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,125
and you two have been gone
for more like half of the day!

192
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,541
Now how do you explain that?

193
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,750
It's time that you two
realized the seriousness

194
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,125
of this situation!

195
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,791
Do you understand me?

196
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,750
--Yes!
--Yes!

197
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,166
[BEE barks]

198
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:40,416
[BUU]
Bee paddle with feet! Good Bee!

199
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,333
[BUU laughs]

200
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,208
[MR. SATAN]
Excuse me, Majin Buu!

201
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,833
Would you like your
back scrubbed?

202
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:49,541
Hahah. Huh? Yes!
Come play! Get in tub!

203
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:52,541
Who, me? Gosh, that's
awfully nice of you!

204
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,666
Are you sure, Buu?

205
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,791
Buu sure! Come play!

206
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,250
[MR. SATAN]
Thank you! I could use a bath!

207
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,291
I'm smelling a little too
manly if you know what I mean!

208
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,833
Ahhh!

209
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,916
Forgive me! Please!

210
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,250
Come closer!

211
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,750
Closer? Okay, Buu! Uh.

212
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,541
Ha!

213
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:20,166
Gotcha! Play! Play!

214
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:27,625
[laughs]

215
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,875
Tadaaaa!

216
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,500
Funny fun!

217
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,083
Funny fun.

218
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:56,750
[MR. SATAN]
Besides almost drowning,

219
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,083
that was a really nice bath!

220
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:04,416
Uh, huh? My prize photo!
I almost forgot!

221
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:11,500
What a perfect picture to go on
the book jacket of my memoirs!

222
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,916
Uh, we're starting
to become friends,

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,458
so I think we should
preserve our new friendship

224
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,708
with some pictures. Yeah.

225
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,916
[MR. SATAN] If you wouldn't
mind lay down on your belly

226
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,416
with your hands
out in front of you.

227
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,458
[BUU]
Like this?

228
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,041
[MR. SATAN]
I know it seems strange,

229
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,875
but this is the latest
style of picture takin'.

230
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,583
[MR. SATAN thinknig]
He's so innocent

231
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,375
I could get him to do anything!

232
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,375
But that's the nice
thing about Majin Buu.

233
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,875
Grrr. I should be
ashamed of myself!

234
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,250
I don't need to fake it anymore!

235
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,416
If I've really convinced
Buu that killing is wrong,

236
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,375
then I truly
have saved the world!

237
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,083
[BUU]
Hey! Buu hungry!

238
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:09,625
You make yummy for Buu's tummy!

239
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,000
[MR. SATAN thinking]
But he just stuffed himself!

240
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,875
I'm coming!
Be right there, Buu!

241
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:21,250
Yum, yum! Tum, tum!
Yum, yum! Tum, tum!

242
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,333
Yum, yum! Tum, tum!

243
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,333
Whoa, Nelly!
That smells good! Mmm!

244
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:32,708
[BUU] Hey! Buu want sweety
sweet chocolates for desert!

245
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,958
Right! Huh? Mmm!

246
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,291
Some hero!

247
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,583
He's destroying our world

248
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,916
and you're cooking
him meals like a nanny!

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,375
You riffraff! [growls]

250
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,166
[BUU]
Bee want chocolate, too?

251
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,416
[BUU]
Hey! Bee want chocolate, too!

252
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,208
[VAN ZANT chuckles]

253
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,583
Now you die!

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,708
Hero!

255
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,000
[VAN ZANT]
Hehehehe! Numbskull!

256
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,208
Oh, no!

257
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,375
No, no!

258
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:44,000

259
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,833
[VAN ZANT] Come on out here,
you pink sack of blubber!

260
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,875
You're next!

261
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,000
Buu hurting!

262
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:53,958
[sobs]

263
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:57,958
Bad man make friend dead! No!

264
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:00,416
[BEE barks]

265
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:08,625
Aaaaaaah!

266
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,500
[gasps]

267
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:33,708
What? Whoa! Buu!
You saved me! I'm alive!

268
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,625
Thank you! Thank you! Huh?

269
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,333
Buu! Are you okay?

270
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,166
[MR. SATAN] Buu! What's the
matter? What happened to you?

271
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:56,791
[BUU] Go away! Go!
Quick! Take Bee and go!

272
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,250
Now! Please! Go!

273
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:03,291
Go? What? Buu, I won't
leave you! I'm your friend!

274
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,000
GO NOW!!!

275
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,166
Got it! Right!

276
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,541
[MR. SATAN]
Buu! Let me try and help you!

277
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,333
[BUU]
GO!!!

278
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,583
[BUU whimpers]

279
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:54,333

[BEE barks]

281
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,750
[PICCOLO]
Yes, Dende! I feel it, too!

282
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,791
Something wicked
is brewing down there!

283
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,291
What is that thing?

284
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,166
[BEE barks]

285
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,333
[MR. SATAN]
Bee! Keep quiet!

286
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,333
Whoa! Are you seeing
what I'm seeing, boy?

287
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,958
[BEE barks]

288
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,666
Bad Buu!

289
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,791
Aaaaugh!

290
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:48,041
[VAN ZANT]
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are y-y-you?

291
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:17,125
They've separated!
Evil from good! This is awful!

292
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,666
[NARRATOR] What strange
personage is this that has been

293
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,041
expelled from the inner
workings of Majin Buu?

294
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:37,000
Is this really the evil
that was within him

295
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,541
manifested in physical form?

296
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,333
And if so, how will
this new threat

297
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,750
affect the fate of the Earth?

298
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,958
It seems the two Buu's
have a bone to pick!

299
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:53,583
Stay tuned for confrontation
on Dragon Ball Z.
