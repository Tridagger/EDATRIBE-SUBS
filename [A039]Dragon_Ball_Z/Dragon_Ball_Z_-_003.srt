1
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,333
Krillin!

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

3
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,875
An uninvited guest crashed the
party on Master Roshi's island.

4
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,250
It was Raditz, an evil
warrior from outer space

5
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,791
who claimed to be
Goku's older brother!

6
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,500
But Raditz proved he had
little regard for family,

7
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,750
as he dealt Goku
a devastating kick

8
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,875
that left the Earth's
most powerful fighter

9
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,583
crumpled in the sand.

10
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,416
And the worst was
yet to come...

11
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,833
Like I said...
I'm taking your son.

12
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:43,041
If you want to
see him alive again,

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,208
I suggest you
listen closely!

14
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,041
[NARRATOR] That's right!
Raditz has captured Gohan!

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,666
And with his young nephew
now firmly in his clutches,

16
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,958
the sinister alien has
issued Goku his demands:

17
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,791
Join him, or suffer
the consequences.

18
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:01,458
Goku is obviously no match for
his brother's awesome power.

19
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,000
Is there any hope
for rescuing his son?

20
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,750
Find out today,
on Dragon Ball Z!

21
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,083
[GOHAN] Waa! Put me down!

22
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,250
[RADITZ] What's the
matter, Kakarot?

23
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,750
You haven't
answered me...

24
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,625
Let's try again.
If you want your son back,

25
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,916
I want you to eliminate
100 Earthlings

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,833
by this time tomorrow...
Do you understand?

27
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,958
Uh-huh.

28
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,250
That's good. Do this little job
for me and you can join us.

29
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,333
But fail, and I'll see
to it your son suffers

30
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,083
a most unpleasant end.

31
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,000
[GOHAN sobs]

32
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,708
[KRILLIN] You coward!
Hiding behind a kid!

33
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,958
Yeah!
That's right!

34
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,166
[ROSHI]
That's right!

35
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,250
You sicko!

36
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,291
And besides, it won't
do you any good!

37
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,416
Goku isn't capable
of killing anyone!

38
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,250
Quiet, old man!

39
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,875
Kakarot is a Saiyan.

40
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,708
I think you'll
be very surprised

41
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,291
at what he's
capable of doing!

42
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:10,916
Of course, it will make no
difference either way...

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,458
Every living thing
on this planet

44
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,791
will be
eliminated soon.

45
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,041
After we've finished
our current job,

46
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,416
I've decided the Earth
will be our next target.

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,916
[whimpers]

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,083
You...
You what?

49
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:27,166
Heh. Even without Kakarot,

50
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,625
three Saiyans should be
more than enough for the job.

51
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:33,083
We could conquer this puny
planet in our sleep.

52
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,041
[GOKU grunts]

53
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,000
[RADITZ]
So you see, brother,

54
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,958
whether you kill 100
Earthlings now or not,

55
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,291
in the end the
result is the same.

56
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,166
Hmm...

57
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,166
[whimpers]

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,833
[GOKU grunts]

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,583
[GOKU] Leave Gohan
out of this...

60
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,541
I wish I could, Kakarot...

61
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,750
But you understand,
I need to give you

62
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,833
a little extra incentive
to do what I've asked.

63
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,125
Please...
Let him go.

64
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:09,166
Hm. Just look at
how pathetic you are.

65
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,666
Please, brother...
Show some pride.

66
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:16,333
You have until tomorrow.
Try to enjoy it.

67
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,708
[GOHAN yells]

68
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,875
[GOKU]
S-Stop!

69
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,958
[GOHAN] Put me down!
Put me down! Daddy!

70
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,458
[GOHAN sobs]

71
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,250
[RADITZ] I'm expecting great
things from you, brother!

72
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,625
Don't let me down!

73
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,416
Gohan!

74
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,208
[RADITZ laughs]

75
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:42,083
Daddy! Help me!
Daddy!

76
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,291
[GOKU]
Gohan! Gohan...

77
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,083
[GOKU screams]

78
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,291
[ALL] Goku!

79
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,083
[BULMA]
Are you alright?

80
00:05:56,166 --> 00:06:01,375
I'm sorry, but there was 
nothing that we could do, Goku.

81
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,291
Nimbus!

82
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,875
No! Goku, wait!

83
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,916
[BULMA] You can't!
You'll be killed!

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,333
Do you really think
you can beat him

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,958
if you go after
him right now?

86
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,708
[GOKU groans]

87
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,125
[GOKU]
I've got to try!

88
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,000
[ROSHI] We need
to use our heads!

89
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,000
He's stronger
than you, Goku!

90
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
We're going to have
to outsmart him.

91
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:31,458
[BULMA]
Easy! Easy! That's it...

92
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,125
There!

93
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,083
[GOKU] I hope
Gohan's all right.

94
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,458
Don't worry...

95
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,875
If he wanted to hurt Gohan,
he would have done it.

96
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,666
It's you that he's
really interested in.

97
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,958
That guy's a beast,
and... He stunk.

98
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,750
[BULMA]
Yeah, I noticed that.

99
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,666
[ROSHI]
Me, too...

100
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,625
I've got it!

101
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,166
Huh?

102
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,416
His tail!
That's his weakness.

103
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,458
Remember when someone
grabbed my tail?

104
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,375
[GOKU groans]

105
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,083
It hurt...
I couldn't move.

106
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,458
Yes!
Good thinking!

107
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:02,875
What?
That's crazy!

108
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,166
He's not just gonna let you
waltz up and grab his tail!

109
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,583
[GOKU] I know. Which is
why I'll need some help.

110
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,791
[KRILLIN] Huh?!

111
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:14,333
Now, wait a minute, Goku...
You don't mean, uh...

112
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,583
Don't worry!
Krillin and I are ready!

113
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,416
We'll put that space pirate
of business, won't we?

114
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,625
Well, if there's
three of us...

115
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,541
I guess
it's possible...

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:31,458
Possible,
but not likely!

117
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
[KRILLIN]
Heeey, wait a second...

118
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,875
If anything should
happen to me,

119
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,000
you'll wish me back with
the Dragon Balls, right?

120
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,791
You can count on me!
I'll do it!

121
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,416
Wait, you guys...
It's no use...

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,083
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

123
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm sorry, Krillin.

124
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,416
You've already been
brought back to life

125
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,625
with the Dragon Balls
once before...

126
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,541
So has Master Roshi.

127
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,916
[KRILLIN and ROSHI]
Ehh...

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,458
So, that's it...
If either of you die again,

129
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,291
this time...
It's for keeps.

130
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,833
The dragon won't grant the
same wish more than once.

131
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,083
[KRILLIN whimpers]

132
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,208
I know...
It's risky.

133
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,750
Wow...

134
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,250
That's...
a bummer.

135
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,666
Yeah. You guys
should just stay here.

136
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,291
And let you
fight alone?!

137
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,083
Yeah! That'd
be suicide!

138
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,250
You think we're
just gonna sit here

139
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,458
while you go off
to get killed?

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,250
[KRILLIN thinking]
What am I saying?

141
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,791
I'm gonna get
creamed out there!

142
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,583
This stinks!
I'm too young to go!

143
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,416
I've never even
had a girlfriend!

144
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,458
Hold on! I think I've got
a way out of this mess!

145
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,541
All we have to do is
gather the Dragon Balls.

146
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,875
Then we can ask the
Dragon to save the planet!

147
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:37,791
That should work!

148
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:40,375
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Yeah! Why not?

149
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,500
[ROSHI] Krillin, we can't gather
all those balls in one day.

150
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,333
Oh, yeah...
That's right.

151
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,833
Well, I say we go right now
and attack him head on!

152
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,125
[GROUP] What?

153
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,666
[GOKU] That's the one thing
he'd never expect.

154
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,166
It might give us an edge and
we need everything we can get.

155
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,083
But, how are we
going to find him?

156
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,083
I don't know! I haven't
figured that part out yet.

157
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,416
Wait! I know!

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,791
Gohan had a Dragon Ball
on his hat, didn't he?

159
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,500
So we can use the
Dragon Radar!

160
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,791
Look! You see?

161
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,083
That's them there!
Man, that's fast!

162
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:15,291
[GOKU]
Thanks, Bulma!

163
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,125
[BULMA]
Sure! Don't mention it!

164
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,000
[ROSHI] Look!

165
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,583
[ALL]
It stopped!

166
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,916
[BULMA] Well, at least they're
not in outer-space somewhere!

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,458
Alright, then.
I'm going after him!

168
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:29,000
What do you say, guys?
You ready?

169
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,708
Yeah! You
never know!

170
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,791
We might just
beat that idiot!

171
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,666
I'm in! Let's go!

172
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,250
Well, whatever happens,

173
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:39,750
you two should know that you're
the best pupils I've ever had.

174
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,458
[ROSHI] Mm-hm.

175
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,666
[MAN] You'll never succeed!
You're too weak!

176
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,083
[KRILLIN]
Piccolo!

177
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,500
[BULMA and ROSHI yell]

178
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,083
[KRILLIN] Oh, great!
What else could go wrong today?

179
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,083
[PICCOLO] I suppose you
could make me angry.

180
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,500
But I wouldn't
advise it.

181
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,458
[GOKU] So... What do
you want, Piccolo?

182
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,583
Yes... Why are you here?
This is my island!

183
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,333
I've been keeping an eye
on your last visitor.

184
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:18,000
I followed
him here.

185
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,666
Oh yeah? What do
you know about him?

186
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,250
I know this much...

187
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,708
The only chance we have of
winning is if I go with you.

188
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,125
[ALL] Eh?!

189
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:31,083
I know we're enemies,
but hear me out!

190
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,208
You've seen how
powerful he is.

191
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,958
Which means you know
as well as I do,

192
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,583
neither of us have the strength
to stand up to him alone.

193
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,333
We'd be dead before
the fight started...

194
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,541
However...

195
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,000
If we team up, there's
a slight possibility

196
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,291
we can overpower him.
It's the only way...

197
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,458
Agreed?

198
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,000
[whimpers]

199
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,625
I don't know.
Why should I trust you?

200
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:55,666
How do I know you
won't turn on me?

201
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,083
[PICCOLO]
The truth is, you don't.

202
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,416
I won't lie to you.

203
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,083
My reasons for doing this
are purely selfish...

204
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:06,958
I could care less what
happens to your son.

205
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,750
But I won't let this guy
take over the Earth...

206
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,791
I plan to do it myself!

207
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,708
[BULMA and TURTLE whimper]

208
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,958
If we team up...

209
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,041
As much as the
idea sickens me,

210
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,083
I'm willing to put
our differences aside.

211
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,125
But as far as I'm concerned,
this truce is only temporary.

212
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,250
The next time
we meet...

213
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,875
...it will be as enemies,
same as always.

214
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,416
[GOKU] And when
that time comes...

215
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,625
I promise I'll do
everything in my power

216
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:34,708
to stop you from
taking over the world!

217
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,041
But until then...

218
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,791
It looks like
we're a team...

219
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,000
You've got a deal.

220
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,541
Alright, then...
Let's consider it done!

221
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,500
If you can stand
to work with me

222
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:49,333
then I suppose I can
bear working with you.

223
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,666
But don't forget...

224
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,583
When this is over, our
alliance is terminated.

225
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,250
[KRILLIN]
Unbelievable!

226
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,041
Bulma, we're gonna need to
borrow your Dragon Radar.

227
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,750
[BULMA] Huh?
Oh... Right, Goku!

228
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,208
Hey Piccolo!

229
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,083
Think you'll be able to keep
up with the Flying Nimbus?

230
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,458
[PICCOLO]
Yeah, right!

231
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,708
Are you kidding?

232
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,458
I'll be embarrassed if
you can keep up with me

233
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,666
on that silly
little toy.

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,000
[BULMA]
Be careful, Goku!

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,958
[KRILLIN] I don't know
how to feel about this.

236
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,125
I mean, should I be
relieved or not?

237
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:52,583
Wow! I still can't believe
that just happened.

238
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,875
It's incredible!

239
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,166
[KRILLIN]
What, seriously?

240
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,333
Think about it...

241
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,791
Those two are the most
powerful fighters

242
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,250
the Earth has to offer...

243
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,208
And together they
might actually win!

244
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,583
[BULMA]
I don't know!

245
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,375
Do you guys really think
we can trust Piccolo?

246
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,666
[KRILLIN]
I don't trust him.

247
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,791
Oh, get over it,
will ya'?

248
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,750
This is going to be the
fight of the century!

249
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,708
Come on! What are
we waiting for?

250
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,333
Fire up those jets, Bulma!
We're going after them!

251
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:23,666
[CHICHI sighs]

252
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,666
[CHICHI] I think I'm turning
into a clean freak...

253
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,708
I guess I'm
just nervous...

254
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:31,458
I do wish those two
would get back soon.

255
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:35,208
That Gohan...
I'm so proud.

256
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,708
He's studied so hard
to learn his math...

257
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,208
Hmm... Maybe he should
be a scientist.

258
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,916
[birds chirp]

259
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:57,208
That bully. I hate him...
Big jerk.

260
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,666
[GOHAN whimpers]

261
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,958
A-Aahhhh!

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,291
[GOHAN]
O-Oh yeah?

263
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,500
My dad could lift
that too, you know!

264
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,333
[GOHAN yells]

265
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,916
[sobs]

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,416
[RADITZ] Shut up!
Stop crying!

267
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,208
[GOHAN] I don't know
why you're so mean!

268
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,375
I didn't do
anything to you!

269
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,916
[cries]

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Quiet! You fool!
Be strong!

271
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,291
You are one of the
brave Saiyans too!

272
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,750
[GOHAN] Ahh! Put me down!
Put me down!

273
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,291
[RADITZ] There! You can come
out when you quiet down.

274
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:55,041
Ahh... That's
much better.

275
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,500
[GOHAN] Hey!

276
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,375
Let me out! Don't go!

277
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,083
Please! Come back!

278
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:06,750
[GOHAN sobs]

279
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,875
Finally...

280
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,375
Now maybe I can round
up something to eat.

281
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,625
[beeping]

282
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:17,458
A power level of 710?

283
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:23,708
This says it's within fifty
meters of here! But where?

284
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,125
What?! Kakarot's kid?
Impossible!

285
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,958
But there's no--but that's
what my scouter's indicating.

286
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:39,958
There's no way a boy could
have such a high power level!

287
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,416
Piece of junk.
It's broken.

288
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,416
Hmph. Faulty piece
of equipment...

289
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,250
Gave me a bit
of a scare.

290
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,000
[beeping]

291
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
We're getting close!

292
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,208
We should land soon so
we can sneak up on him!

293
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,458
[PICCOLO] Forget it!
It's no good!

294
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,375
[GOKU] What? But we'll
have a much better chance

295
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,291
of winning if
we surprise him!

296
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,875
He's wearing a device that
can detect our power levels.

297
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,083
He can track our
exact location!

298
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:13,083
What? You're saying he
already knows we're on the way?

299
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,708
I'm saying it's
very likely!

300
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,333
Alright then! I guess that
leaves us only one choice...

301
00:16:19,416 --> 00:16:21,416
We attack him
head on!

302
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,666
[RADITZ] Next time,
I'll cook the meat!

303
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,208
[beeping]

304
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,708
Hmm...

305
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,125
This thing's still
going haywire!

306
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,208
And I didn't even
bring the manual...

307
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,875
Still 710!

308
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,416
Piece of junk...

309
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,625
[beeping]

310
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,416
What?!

311
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,958
A power level of 650?

312
00:16:54,041 --> 00:17:00,666
No. There's two...
One's 320 and the other's 330.

313
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,000
Kakarot has a power
level of 330,

314
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:06,625
but Kakarot wouldn't
be coming here...

315
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,583
He can't beat me,
and he knows it.

316
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,708
Besides, he has
no idea where I am.

317
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,666
That's it... This thing
is driving me crazy.

318
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,750
[RADITZ sighs]

319
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,541
I need to
take it easy!

320
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,250
[beeping]

321
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,375
Huh?
What the...

322
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,208
Kakarot is here!

323
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,916
[RADITZ thinking] But, if
my scouter's not broken...

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,833
No... This can't be accurate!

325
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,000
It is impossible for
a child that small

326
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:44,416
to have a power level
of 710! I'm sure of it!

327
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,000
[RADITZ]
Well, well, well.

328
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,083
Look who's decided to drop
in. It's little brother.

329
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:05,041
Oh, and he's brought
the green man with him.

330
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,000
I was wondering who that
second insignificant blip

331
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,458
on my scouter
might be.

332
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,833
I confess, I didn't
expect it to be you.

333
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:16,000
What a pleasant surprise.

334
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,833
I have to hand it
to you, brother...

335
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,833
I didn't think I'd see
you 'til tomorrow.

336
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:24,541
You're a little more
resourceful than I thought.

337
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,083
And more
foolish as well.

338
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:29,333
[GOKU]
We'll see about that!

339
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:34,125
Fair enough... So, what
brings you here, Kakarot?

340
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,250
Do tell... Have you already
eliminated 100 Earthlings?

341
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,916
[GOKU] I'm here to get my
son back... Where is he?

342
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,041
That's my Daddy!

343
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,000
[RADITZ] You are testing
my patience, Kakarot...

344
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,833
I've been more than
generous with you, so far.

345
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,958
Now for the
last time,

346
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,541
I strongly recommend
that you join us!

347
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,416
I don't care what
you recommend!

348
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,791
The answer is still no!

349
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,583
[cries]

350
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,625
That hurt!

351
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,666
You should listen
to your big brother.

352
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,208
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't have a brother!

353
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,708
Alright then...

354
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,083
You can have it
your way, Kakarot.

355
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,166
I didn't come here
to kill you...

356
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,750
But it seems you
have left me no choice.

357
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,666
It's too bad,
little brother!

358
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,625
I do think you would've
found the life

359
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,791
of a Saiyan to be
quite invigorating!

360
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,500
[PICCOLO] Alright!
I've heard enough talk!

361
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,375
You know why we're here!
So let's get on with it!

362
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,583
Huh? Piccolo!

363
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,666
I had no idea you trained
with weighted clothing, too.

364
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,625
What? Thought you
were the only one?

365
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,708
[PICCOLO grunts]

366
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,583
Oh, yeah. I feel
much lighter now.

367
00:19:56,666 --> 00:20:00,791
[RADITZ thinking] Hm... His
power level's gone up to 400.

368
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,375
There's thirty pounds...

369
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:09,250
and here's fifty,
and another fifty!

370
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,625
And two
little fivers!

371
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,000
That oughta do it, Piccolo,

372
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,916
unless you can think
of something else.

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,500
[PICCOLO] What am I,
your tailor?

374
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,375
[RADITZ laughs]

375
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,000
[RADITZ]
Do you two really think

376
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,250
that's going to
make a difference?

377
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,833
Fools! Who do
you think I am?

378
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,416
A few weights aren't
going to affect

379
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,458
the outcome of
this fight!

380
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,083
I'm still ten times
stronger than you are!

381
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,458
[GOKU]
That may be true!

382
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:40,000
But strength isn't the
only thing that matters!

383
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,708
[PICCOLO] Huh?

384
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,625
Not when you can
outsmart your opponent.

385
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,458
You really don't have
a clue, do you brother?

386
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,208
You know what? I think
I've decided I don't want you

387
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,375
to join us anymore...

388
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,625
A fool like you would
only slow us down.

389
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,666
You're a disgrace
to all Saiyans!

390
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,250
Now prepare to die!

391
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,083
[GOKU and PICCOLO groan]

392
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,458
[RADITZ laughs]

393
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,083
[GOKU thinking]
H-He's so fast!

394
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,666
I've never seen anyone
move like that.

395
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,083
[PICCOLO thinking]
It's like he disappeared.

396
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,208
I couldn't follow his
movements at all!

397
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:37,958
One second,
he was in front of us.

398
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,000
And then the next, it was--

399
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:46,708
Well, I'll give you this...
You know how to take a punch.

400
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:51,208
Good... That should only make
this all the more enjoyable.

401
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:55,916
Oh yes... Let's find out how
much pain you can really stand.

402
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,625
[PICCOLO thinking]
I knew he was strong,

403
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,250
but for his power to be
that much greater...

404
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,666
[GOKU thinking] I need to
find a way to grab his tail.

405
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,750
That's the only
chance we have!

406
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,125
What's wrong?

407
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,083
You look so
pensive, Kakarot,

408
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,583
are you still trying
to outsmart me?

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,291
Well, think about
this while you're at it...

410
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,875
Your situation is even more
hopeless than you realize.

411
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:23,500
[laughs]

412
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,291
If you think I'm strong now,
wait until I catch my stride.

413
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,875
Truth is, I'm just
getting warmed up.

414
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:33,125
[gasps]

415
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,375
[NARRATOR] What sort of
monstrous foe is this

416
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,708
that now stands like a giant
between Goku and his son?

417
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,875
And what are
the true limits

418
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,833
of his already
unbelievable power?

419
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,541
Even with their
forces combined,

420
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,958
it seems Goku and
Piccolo have little hope

421
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,958
of toppling this
mighty villain.

422
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,625
But will they
overcome the odds

423
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,708
and find a way
to take him down?

424
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:53,875
Find out, as the
battle continues...

425
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,875
Next Dragon Ball Z!
