00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,416
The Ginyu Force faces up to Goku

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,333
in a mighty showdown,
and Goku turns up the heat

4
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:25,166
revealing his true strength
to the ruthless warriors.

5
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,458
An astonished Captain
Ginyu realizes

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,000
that he has come face-to-face

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:33,833
with the power Frieza fears
most: that of a Super Sayian.

8
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,708
[NARRATOR] Elsewhere
on the Planet Namek,

9
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,750
Frieza pays a visit to the aging
Guru to uncover the password

10
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,833
needed to call forth the
dragon and grant his wish.

11
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,583
Namek warriors try to intervene,
but Frieza launches into

12
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,416
an attack and easily
disposes of them.

13
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,416
[NARRATOR] Now, with
the Namekian warriors

14
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
out of the way,
only Nail can defend Guru

15
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,416
and keep Frieza from
getting his password.

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,666
[NARRATOR} Can this
brave fighter hold off

17
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,333
the evil tyrant?
Find out today.

18
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,875
[FRIEZA cackles]

19
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,375
[FRIEZA] Oh, please, Nail,

20
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:47,166
do you really believe that
you could possibly harm me?

21
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,708
Why, I would have thought you
were much smarter than that,

22
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,666
but I guess I
misjudged you!

23
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,250
[FRIEZA chuckles]

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,416
By the way, Guru,

25
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,541
once I'm finished
with your friend here,

26
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,291
I'll be back to see
if you've reconsidered

27
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,958
giving me the password. Hmph.

28
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,583
[NAIL growls softly]

29
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,166
[FRIEZA] So, you see,
it's really quite simple.

30
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,083
I'll spare his life for
the Dragon Ball password.

31
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,916
His fate rests in your hands
so I suggest you choose wisely!

32
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,041
I guess that answers
that question, doesn't it?

33
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,625
Oh well, let's
get on with it.

34
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:29,833
And now my friend, any last
wishes before I kill you?

35
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:34,875
[NAIL growls]

36
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,833
[NAIL] You want to fight?!
Fine! But not here!

37
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,500
I don't want Guru to see what
I'm going to do to you!

38
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,750
[NAIL] You see, he doesn't
have much time, Frieza,

39
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,750
and I want to spare him
the unpleasantries.

40
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,708
So, c'mon, let's do it!

41
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,541
I admire your courage,
but let's be honest.

42
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:01,750
Once I'm done with you, then
I'll deal with your friend here.

43
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,833
[NAIL] Follow me!

44
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,791
[GURU] Such horrible evil.

45
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,875
Nail, my son...
I know it's grim.

46
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,083
Still, you must battle on.
For the Earthlings...

47
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,583
They need more time.

48
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,750
[GURU sighs heavily]

49
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,458
They may be
our last chance

50
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,750
to save the universe from
that hideous Frieza.

51
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:54,041
[JEICE] I... I think
he's laughing.

52
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,291
[GINYU laughing]

53
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,125
Capt...
C-Captain Ginyu?

54
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,625
[GINYU laughing]

55
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:06,541
[GINYU chuckles]

56
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,458
What are you
laughing at?!

57
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:11,375
[GINYU laughs]

58
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,708
[GINYU growls]

59
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,166
Yaah!

60
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:21,291
[GINYU chuckles]

61
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,583
You crack
me up, bucko.

62
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,041
I've never seen someone so
cool in the line of fire!

63
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,750
I'm warning
you to go home!

64
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,750
[GINYU] Oh, I know you are!

65
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,875
But I think we should
just turn it up a notch!

66
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,875
[GINYU growls]

67
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,666
Yaah!

68
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,125
Hyaah!

69
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,500
[GINYU laughs]

70
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:48,333
For a peace-loving
do-gooder like yourself,

71
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,625
I'm pretty impressed!

72
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,625
[GINYU laughs]

73
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get it on!

74
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,458
[GINYU laughs]

75
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:58,750
That's right, folks!

76
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,166
It's time for the grand
finale of grand finales!

77
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,291
No one can survive the awesome
power of the Ginyu Force!

78
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,125
Rrraaagh!

79
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,750
[JEICE grunts]

80
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:31,916
[GINYU chuckles]

81
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,875
Huh...? Wha...?

82
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:57,041
[GINYU chuckles]

83
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,208
Hey, Jeice!

84
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,583
Yes, Sir...?

85
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,208
[GINYU] Hold on to that.

86
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,416
But... Cap'n,
you'll need the scouter!

87
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,166
I think not! The stronger
this guys is, the better!

88
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,791
I hear you
loud and clear!

89
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:14,541
[GOKU] Hmm?

90
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:18,625
[GINYU snickers]

91
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,416
[laughing]

92
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:29,166
So, where are we going?

93
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,750
I said, where
are we going?!

94
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:40,083
This is far enough! It's
time to put up or shut up!

95
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,666
This way.

96
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:06,083
[FRIEZA] Before you begin your
pathetic struggle to survive,

97
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,875
I should warn you, your chance
of winning is non-existent!

98
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:28,291
[NAIL growls]

99
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,958
Oooh.

100
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:34,625
[growling continues]

101
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,125
[NAIL yells]

102
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,833
Oh my. According to my
readout, I may have

103
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,958
underestimated
your strength!

104
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,541
But no matter.

105
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:50,666
Your power pales in comparison
to what I have in store for you!

106
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,791
[FRIEZA] Not to say the
light show wasn't impressive,

107
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,666
but you see, I'm probably five
hundred thousand times stronger

108
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,083
than you are!

109
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,291
So, in order to keep
this a fair fight...

110
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,083
I promise to
refrain from using

111
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,000
all of my powers on you,

112
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,208
for they are obviously
powers which you,

113
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,375
my green little friend,
do not possess.

114
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,625
Observe my left hand...

115
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,750
Its strength alone
is enough to crush you

116
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:23,958
like the little bug you are.

117
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,625
So as a special
one-time bonus...

118
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,750
Huh?

119
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,333
[NAIL growls]

120
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:34,000
Today, I will fight you while
my other hand is behind my back!

121
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,208
So, now that we've got the
ground rules settled,

122
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,708
shall we begin?

123
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,083
[NAIL growls]

124
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:45,875
[NAIL] I've had enough of
you! It's time to fight!

125
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,958
[NAIL shouts]

126
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,500
[FRIEZA laughs]

127
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,500
[FRIEZA] Oh my, oh my! You
still don't get it, do you?

128
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:05,083
You see, the bottom line
is you don't stand a chance!

129
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,333
I'll show you...

130
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,916
And like I said before,
I'll only use my left hand!

131
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:17,458
[FRIEZA laughs,
NAIL squeals]

132
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:25,583
[NAIL screams]

133
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,333
[NAIL pants]

134
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,083
[FRIEZA] Oh my,
that has got to hurt!

135
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,000
[FRIEZA laughs]

136
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,250
[FRIEZA] Here!

137
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,708
You might want to keep
it as a back scratcher!

138
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:47,833
[FRIEZA cackles]

139
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,125
A back scratcher!

140
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,208
Where do I come up
with this stuff?!

141
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:57,041
Enough idle chit-chat.
I should really get back to Guru

142
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,291
and see if he's changed his
mind about that password.

143
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,541
[NAIL growls]

144
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,125
[NAIL shouting]

145
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,125
Hm?

146
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:16,375
[shouting continues]

147
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,333
That didn't show up
in the readout!

148
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,791
The ability to re-generate
one's own anatomy!

149
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,875
I'll just have to make
a copy of that power,

150
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:37,000
because you never know
when it might come in handy.

151
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,125
Well, now...

152
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,958
Most of the warriors
I know would have

153
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,291
surrendered by now, but...

154
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,708
I don't think you've learned
your lesson, have you?

155
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:59,666
Alright, let's try it again.

156
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,833
Yeah, let's try it.

157
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,541
[FRIEZA chuckles]

158
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,208
This time you'll lose.

159
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:24,583
Agh! why can't this
thing go any faster?!

160
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,333
And just my luck, Dino here
isn't even breaking a sweat

161
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,416
Oohh...

162
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,333
[DINOSAUR roars]

163
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,416

[BULMA screams]

165
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,583
Huh?!

166
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,041
Oh no! Now what
am I gonna do?!

167
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,291
[thinking] The cave!

168
00:13:55,375 --> 00:14:00,166
Just a little further!
C'mon girl, you can make it!

169
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,375
Ah! I made it! I-I made it!

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,875
[DINOSAUR B roars]

171
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,708

[BULMA shrieks]

173
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:21,166
Whew. My industrial
strength... hairspray...

174
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,375
Huh?!

175
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,875
[BULMA wails]

176

[BULMA screams]

177
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,166
Oh, this is just great!

178
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,291
Why did I have to start
biting my nails again?!

179
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,708
[BULMA screams]

180
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:44,791
[DINOSAUR B roars]

181
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,083
Okay, I'll
close my eyes...

182
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,125
and he'll just disappear.

183
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,333
Who am I trying to kid?!

184
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,708
[BULMA yelps]

185
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,166
[grunts]

186
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,750
Huh...?

187
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,625
What... What...?
What in the world?!

188
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,750
[BULMA screams]

189
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,583
No, no, no! Don't
you come near me!

190
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,333
Get away from me
you hideous creature!

191
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:25,083
Get away and leave me alone
or I'll be forced to--

192
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,625
Huh?

193
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,125
Is that...
you Gohan?

194
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:30,875
But...

195
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,000
[BULMA gasps]

196
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,333
[KRILLIN growls]

197
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,375
[GOHAN chuckling]

198
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,583
Hey... Give
me a break...

199
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,208
It's not funny!

200
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,000
Man, you try and
give somebody a hand

201
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,875
and this is the thanks you get!

202
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,750
Well, look who
finally shows up!

203
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,958
Last time I saw you two was
when you were going to get the

204
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,708
Dragon Balls and you
said you'd be right back!

205
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,250
Do you realize how many
times I've heard that one?!

206
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,708
Well, I'm sick and tired
of waiting by myself!

207
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:56,666
From now on, I'm in charge
and if you don't like it,

208
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,083
that's tough! Any questions?!

209
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,458
Come on, it's not like
we were avoiding you.

210
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,458
Look, we were just
busy that's all!

211
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,000
[GOHAN] That's right!

212
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,166
We've been working real hard
to get the Dragon Balls back.

213
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,750
And we'll get them soon.

214
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,458
Why, you...!

215
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,166
You don't even have
the Dragon Balls?!

216
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,083
And here I am waiting,
being chased by every

217
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,541
wild beast imaginable,
I haven't showered in weeks,

218
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,875
not to mention I ran out
of lip gloss a month ago,

219
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,750
and you come back empty handed?!

220
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:27,583
So then... what do you
have to say for yourself?

221
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:32,166
We... We are sorry...
At least I think?

222
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,375
Krillin, I found it.

223
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,000
According to this,
they're not far away

224
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,875
They're over in that direction!

225
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,916
[KRILLIN] Let's go!

226
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,375
[BULMA] Wait! Where
are you going?!

227
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,375
You can't just leave
me here again!

228
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,625
Don't worry, we'll
be back in no time!

229
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,041
Just go back
to the campsite

230
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,291
and we'll meet you there, okay?

231
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,083
Hey! This is
plain ridiculous!

232
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm not just going to wait here
again! Wait! Come back here!

233
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,000
What'd expect me just to
walk to the campsite?

234
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:06,541
Oh, yeah! I almost forgot!
I saw my father!

235
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,791
What? Are
you serious?!

236
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,958
You saw Goku?
Well, did he ask about me?

237
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,250
[GOHAN] Uh-huh!

238
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,375
[GOHAN laughs]

239
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:15,583
[BULMA laughs]

240
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,416
[KRILLIN] Gohan, we'd
better get going!

241
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,916
Gotcha!

242
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,458
[BULMA] Ahh... Goku.

243
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,750
[BULMA] Now, let's see...

244
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,916
I don't remember exactly
how long it's been

245
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,125
since I last saw him...

246
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:46,083
It's been so long, I wonder
what he looks like now?

247
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,166
[BULMA] Hmm...

248
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,250
[BULMA] Oh, Goku, when
will I see you again?

249
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:13,875
[GINYU chuckles]

250
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,500
[GINYU yells]

251
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:17,875
[GOKU gasps]

252
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,541
[GINYU grunts]

253
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,375
This guy... is nuts!

254
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,333
[GOKU] What the...?

255
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:39,916
Now... it's time...

256
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,500
to reveal the ultimate strength
of the Ginyu Force...

257
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,083
Watch... because the show...
is just... about to... begin!

258
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:55,208
Wow! What's he doing?

259
00:18:55,291 --> 00:19:03,750
[GINYU growling]

260
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:09,750
[growling continues]

261
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,666
[JEICE] That's it,
mate! Good work.

262
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,708
Now let's pull it
together... and... It's done.

263
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,583
[GINYU shouting]

264
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:32,916
[shouting continues]

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,958
[thinking] C'mon, give me your
best shot you crazy kook!

266
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,375
Yaaah!

267
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,500
Yeah... that's it!

268
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:54,041
You're... miiinnnee!

269
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,875
[GOKU grunting]

270
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,250
[GINYU laughing]

271
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:08,708
[GINYU] Yaaah!

272
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:15,333
[GINYU laughing]

273
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:19,000
Haaaughh...

274
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,416
[GOKU grunts]

275
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,250
[GINYU laughs]

276
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,541
[GOKU gasps]

277
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,500
Why, you... Hey...

278
00:20:56,583 --> 00:21:00,041
What kind of powers
did you use?!

279
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,916
[GINYU chuckles]

280
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,250
[GINYU] The power to
metamorph into your body and

281
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,250
fool your men!

282
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:12,666
[GOKU ] It's impossible!
No... It can't be!

283
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:18,666
[JEICE] Captain Ginyu...
Here's your scouter back!

284
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,458
Good... Now let's
head back to the ship.

285
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,875
I'm sure Frieza will be glad to
hear that I've defeated Goku.

286
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,333
Yeah!

287
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,708
[GINYU laughs]

288
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,625
Hey, this new body
is pretty quick!

289
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:40,166
[GOKU] Hey, wait! W-Wait! You
can't leave me like this!

290
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:46,000
Arrgh! The pain's too strong
and I don't think I can go on!

291
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,041
But I must summon
the strength...

292
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,416
Nooo! I... will
not... be defeated this way!

293
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,458
Even if it takes the last ounce
of strength in my body!

294
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,083
You will not get away with this!

295
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,583
[GOKU groans]

296
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:06,666
I just... wish there was a way
to warn Krillin and Gohan

297
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,875
about what's coming their way!

298
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,541
[thinking] You can run and you
can hide in my body, Ginyu,

299
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,333
but mark my words, this
battle is not over...

300
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,083
NOT by a long shot!

301
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:23,375
Count on it Ginyu...
It's not over!

302
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:37,041
[NARRATOR] Now that Captain
Ginyu possesses Goku's body,

303
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,250
will he be able convince
Krillin and Gohan

304
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,833
that he is who
he appears to be?

305
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
Will he be able
to trick them into

306
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,041
giving him the Dragon Balls?

307
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,916
And can Goku get his body back?

308
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,750
Find out on the next
exciting episode of...

309
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:53,041
Dragon Ball Z!
