[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,083
Majin Buu touched down
on the sacred world of the Kais,

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,291
and the battle began!

4
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,833
[NARRATOR] Goku was the
first to enter the fray!

5
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,583
Rather than attack Buu
as a single fused warrior,

6
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:31,208
he and Vegeta had decided
to fight one at a time!

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,166
It would be a one on
one fight to the finish,

8
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,958
the ultimate test,
for the ultimate Saiyan Warrior!

9
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,791
[KID BUU laughs]

10
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,500
[GOKU] Darn you.
Where's your weak point?

11
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,291
You're twice as strong
as you were before.

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,250
Your speed, your power,
your recovery.

13
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:55,166

15
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,875
[NARRATOR] 
As Goku soon realized,

16
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,416
if he was to win this fight,
he could hold nothing back!

17
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,333
Majin Buu seemed pleased
by this new development,

18
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,166
but does he really
know what it means

19
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,166
to do battle with a
Super Saiyan Three?!

20
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,750
[GOKU]
Okay, let's see what you've got!

Come on, Goku! Yeah!

42
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,833
[YAMCHA] So far so good. Seems
like Goku's holding his own.

Man, I've never seen
a fight like this.

46
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,916
Neither have I. Yes, this
is most unusual, indeed!

47
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,375
Mez, take a look.

48
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,875
Isn't that the same guy
that fell off Snake Way

49
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:36,500
and beat you in a foot race?

50
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:37,875
Hey, you're right, Goz!

51
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:42,375
Well, no wonder he was able
to beat me. What a guy!

52
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:44,291
He's not that great.

53
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,833
I know I could have beat him if
I didn't lose both of my legs.

54
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,625
Lousy, no good Saiyan monkey!

55
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,000
Who's Goku fighting with?

56
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,333
That imp's giving him a
tougher fight than I did,

57
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,166
and he quit against me.

58
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,416
I don't know, but I
do like that pink.

59
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,083

Oh yes, I taught him everything
that he knows about fighting.

though, it's all brawn.

Sorry to butt in like that,
but I'm not done yet.

186
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,958
Majin Buu's so much stronger

187
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,958
than anyone I've
ever faced before,

188
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,791
but I know there's
still a way to win!

How do you do it, Kakarot?

You've always been like this,

197
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,083
ever since the day
I first met you.

198
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,041
Always ready to meet
the next challenge,

199
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,083
even if it's bigger
than you are.

200
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,291
[VEGETA]
So we meet at last!

201
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,166
We have been expecting
you, Kakarot!

202
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,208
We were begining to
think you wouldn't show!

203
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:57,375
Hopefully now things will get
more interesting around here.

[VEGETA thinking]
How can this be happening?

209
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,000
I am a Super Elite!

210
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,208
The prince of all Saiyans!

211
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:40,708
[VEGETA thinking] And he is just
a low level, a common soldier!

212
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,500
I am one of the greatest
fighters in the Universe!

213
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,500
It was the same on Namek,

214
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,000
you had improved so much

215
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,416
that it made Recoome look
like he was standing still.

216
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,875
[VEGETA thinking] Your power
had increased so dramatically

217
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,166
since our battle on Earth,
that I thought you had done it.

218
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,000
I thought that you had
become a Super Saiyan.

219
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:07,000
It tore me apart.

220
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:11,625
How could a low-class soldier
accomplish so easily what I,

221
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,375
I had struggled my
whole life to achieve?

222
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,166
[VEGETA thinking]
After three millennia,

223
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,000
it has finally happened, a new
Super Saiyan has emerged!

224
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:36,125
And some how, I have become
this pompous witness.

225
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:42,583
[VEGETA thinking] Then at last,
it happened! I too, transformed.

226
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,458
[VEGETA thinking] After living
every moment of every day

227
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:49,000
for the singular purpose
of surpassing you,

228
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,708
I finally became
a Super Saiyan myself.

229
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,125
The Prince had
reclaimed his throne

230
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,125
and fulfilled his destiny!

231
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,625
[VEGETA thinking] But no
matter how strong I became,

232
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:15,250
your power still exceeded mine!

233
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,750
[VEGETA talking] At first, I
thought it was your loved ones,

234
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,916
that it was your
instinct to protect them

235
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,208
that spurred you on, and
pushed you beyond your limits.

236
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,750
[VEGETA thinking]
But then I found myself

237
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,750
with a family of my own,

238
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,583
and my power
didn't increase at all.

239
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,083
[VEGETA thinking]
I used to fight

240
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,833
for the sheer pleasure of it.

241
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:45,250
For the thrill of the hunt!

242
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:50,375
Oh, I had the strength
immesurable! I spared no one!

243
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,958
And yet, you showed
mercy to everyone,

244
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,916
even your fiercest enemies.

245
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,291
Even me!

246
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:02,125
Yet you never fought
to kill, or for revenge.

247
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,000
Only to test your limits,

248
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,833
and to push yourself
beyond them,

249
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,291
to become the strongest
you could possibly be!

250
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
[VEGETA thinking] How can a
Saiyan fight like that and,

251
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,166
at the same time,

252
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,166
be so gentle that he
wouldn't hurt a fly?

253
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,375
Oh, it makes me angry
just thinking about it.

254
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:22,625
But perhaps it is my anger
that has made me blind

255
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,250
to the truth for so long.

256
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:27,916
I see it now. This day
has made it all too clear.

257
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,583
You're better than me,
Kakarot. You are the best.

Goku his vote of confidence,

274

but can the mighty Saiyan
sustain his monumental effort?

275
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,208
The fight that will decide the
fate of the Universe continues

276

of Dragon Ball Z!
