he'll be fighting in the

178
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:12,666
World Martial Arts
Tournament

179
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,083
against that wicked
monster Cell!

180
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:19,208
[cheering]

181
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,083
Now here's our man!
Hercule Satan!

182
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:26,708
[cheering continues]

183
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:32,250
[MR. SATAN yells]

184
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,875
[MR. SATAN roars]

185
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,208
What's with the goofball?

186
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,541
He's the world champion
of martial arts.

187
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:43,458
Aren't you worried,
Mr. Satan? Even a little?

188
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,708
Cell destroyed the entire
Royal Military with his power!

189
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,458
What do you have to say to that?

190
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,500
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

191
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,458
This was all just a cheap trick!

192
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:54,541
Cell planted bombs just
before the Military came.

193
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,625
He might be an
expert with explosives,

194
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,375
but as you can see, from
a Martial Arts standpoint,

195
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,791
he's an amateur!

196
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:04,125
And I, Hercule, the greatest
fighter in the world,

197
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,250
will crush that fake
with my little finger!

198
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,625
Now, yell if you love me!

199
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:16,166
[CROWD cheers]

200
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,291
[KRILLIN sighs]

201
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,000
Man\, that guy's a real moron!

202
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,250
[ALL gasp]

203
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,250
Now where on Earth
have you been, Goku?!

204
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,333
Do you think I know
how to drive?!

205
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,083
[GOKU] I'm sorry, ChiChi,

206
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,583
but if I could just talk to
Krillin and Gohan for a minute,

207
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,958
there's someone at the
lookout who'd like to see them!

208
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,125
[GOHAN] Who is it, Dad?

209
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,375
[KRILLIN] Is this person,
uh, friendly?

210
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,625
[GOKU laughs] Come on!

211
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,333
[DENDE gasps] Krillin!
Gohan! You're here!

212
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,458
Dende! It's you!

213
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,833
Ha-ha!

214
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,291
[DENDE giggles]

215
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,625
--[GOHAN &amp; DENDE laugh]
--It's been so long!

216
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:09,333
Sure is good to see you, Dende!

217
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,833
[GOHAN] So is it true you're
gonna take over Kami's position?

218
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,208
[DENDE] I think!

219
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,291
Guardian of Earth! Wow!
That's one heck of a title!

220
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,166
Now we can see
each other every day!

221
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,291
Yeah!

222
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,833
[PICCOLO] Now, Dende!

223
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,750
Are you
absolutely certain

224
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,750
you're ready to handle
the Dragon Balls?

225
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:33,166
Lighten up, Piccolo. After all,
the old guy told me that Dende

226
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,541
was one of the most talented
Nameks on their planet!

227
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,666
Old guy?

228
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,125
He's talking
about our Elder Moori.

229
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,291
That's right!

230
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,083
That old guy said Dende had

231
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:46,750
everything it takes to make
a good guardian for Earth!

232
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,708
I'm pretty sure
I should be able to make

233
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,916
new Dragon Balls
within 100 days!

234
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,458
Oh no! We... really
can't wait that long!

235
00:13:57,916 --> 00:13:59,458
[KRILLIN groans]

236
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,916
[DENDE sighs]

237
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,916
Hold on, if you still
have the old Dragon Balls

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
and the model
of the Dragon,

239
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:09,916
then I should be able
to do it right away!

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,291
Alright!

241
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,000
The old Dragon Balls are
scattered across the Earth,

242
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,625
changed into stone!

243
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:19,500
And yes, the Dragon
Model's in my room!

244
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,875
Awesome!
Let's cook this dragon up!

245
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,125
Yeah!

246
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,750
Oh, hey, Dende,
what about wishes?

247
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,250
Can you make it grant
three just like on Namek?

248
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,000
Sure!

249
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,500
What about its power?

250
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,125
This isn't Namek,

251
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,458
and with three wishes
the Dragon might be weakened!

252
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:40,208
Now think, can you
make it bring back

253
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,875
all those killed
by Cell with one wish?

254
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
[DENDE gasps]

255
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:48,041
Well, all I have to do is
re-channel some of its energy

256
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
into its wishing power,

257
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:53,833
but that way it can only
grant two wishes each time.

258
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,666
Wow! You can really do all that?

259
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,833
Uh-huh!

260
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:01,166
Good enough, make
the dragon like that.

261
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,125
Yes, I'll try.
So, should I start?

262
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,416
[PICCOLO] Mr. Popo,
bring us the model please.

263
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,875
[MR. POPO] Yes.

264
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:14,708
[MR. POPO] Here we are.

265
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,500
Careful, I made
this dragon myself.

266
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:22,291
[DENDE] What an
interesting shape.

267
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,291
Okay, I guess I'll begin.

268
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,875
Good luck, Dende!

269
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,916
[KRILLIN] Yeah! We're
behind ya all the way!

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,375
Hey, thanks!

271
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:45,250
[DENDE chants in Namekian]

272
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,791
[ALL gasp]

273
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,625
[DENDE] It's all done.

274
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,375
The Dragon can
be summoned as soon

275
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,208
as the Dragon Balls
are collected.

276
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,416
Already?

277
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,458
So fast!

278
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,708
[PICCOLO &amp; NAIL thinking]
Good work, Dende!

279
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,333
I always knew you
would be something great.

280
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:24,375
Now, I'll borrow Bulma's
Dragon Ball Radar

281
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,416
and go collect them right away!

282
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,125
Good luck, Goku.

283
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,708
Yeah, thanks!

284
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:32,416
Hey, Gohan, why
don't you stay here

285
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,041
and have fun with Dende
until the tournament begins?

286
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,625
Uh, are you sure?

287
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,333
I'm positive,
just have a good time!

288
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,666
[TRUNKS] Goku! Uh, can
I ask you one thing?

289
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,250
What's that?

290
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,875
It's because you've discovered
some sort of weak point to Cell

291
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,041
that you're acting so calm
and confident, isn't it?

292
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, I'm afraid Cell
doesn't have a weak point.

293
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,833
Alright, see you later!

294
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,958
Goku! You really do just pop
in and out of places, don't you?

295
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,458
You should take a look
at the circuits on this guy!

296
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:19,208
Dr. Gero was a genius.

297
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,916
Huh. Well, Bulma,
I'm kinda in a hurry.

298
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,125
See, I got the Earth
some new Dragon Balls

299
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:27,500
and I was hoping I could
borrow your radar for a while?

300
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:28,958
Oh, sure!

301
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,000
The radar should be right
there in the second drawer.

302
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,458
Gee, thanks!

303
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,333
Great! Seems to be working!

304
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:46,875
I should be able to find the
Dragon Balls in no time at all!

305
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,958
Well, see ya!

306
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:51,958
Hey, Goku!

307
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,583
Huh! Oh well!

308
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,375
I was just going to ask him
how Trunks is doing up there,

309
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,500
but... I'm sure he's fine!

310
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,958
Must be close!

311
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,375
Alright, it's right here!

312
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,458
Huh! Well?

313
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,833
[GOKU chuckles]

314
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,291
I don't see it...

315
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,833
Gohan, did your
father tell you anything?

316
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,666
We've all heard Goku say that
Cell is stronger than he is

317
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,916
and that Cell has no weaknesses.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,125
So why is he acting so cheerful?

319
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:52,666
I've asked my dad and he
hasn't told me anything.

320
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,625
All he says is, "Don't worry".

321
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,500
"Don't worry"?

322
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,375
I don't know. I mean,
if that's what he said,

323
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:04,250
maybe he really does
have some plan to defeat Cell.

324
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,041
Or maybe he's in denial...

325
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,625
What's up?

326
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,666
It says it's here, but it's not!

327
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,333
[MAN] Hey! You there!

328
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,375
Hey! Watch out!
There's a sandstorm coming!

329
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,416
Better shut your eyes!

330
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,250
[GOKU] ...Ohhh!

331
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,875
Of course! These heavy winds
must have buried

332
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,625
the Dragon Ball
underneath the sand!

333
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,958
Thank you!

334
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,250
Now!

335
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,375
Here goes nothin!

336
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,541
[GOKU yells]

337
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,458
This one's bad! I feel
sorry for that guy!

338
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,833
[MAN gasps]

339
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:30,000
Aw yeah! I can't believe Dende
really brought them back!

340
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:33,875
[NARRATOR] The Dragon Balls
have been restored...

341
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,166
But the clock
continues to tick,

342
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,833
with each fighter
passing the time

343
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:39,291
in their own way.

344
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,875
[NARRATOR] Some train...

345
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,666
--[GOHAN] So that's what we did.
--[NARRATOR] Some talk...

346
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,291
[KRILLIN] So, you're
always a Super Saiyan?

347
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,208
[GOHAN] Except for
when I sleep.

348
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,125
[NARRATOR] And others
seek to make sense

349
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,375
out of the days
that lie ahead.

350
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,791
[birds chirping,

[GOKU mumbles]

00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,750
the mighty Cell is waiting.
