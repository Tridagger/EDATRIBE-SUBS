00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,166
Trunks pushed his strength
to record-breaking levels.

3
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,750
But the Saiyan's bulky
muscles made him too slow

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,083
to land a decent punch.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,333
Giving Cell the advantage.

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,708
[NARRATOR] Down but not out,

7
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Trunks got back on his feet and
was ready to go another round,

8
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:34,458
but Cell had
other plans in mind.

9
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,833
[CELL] How did you
get so strong?

10
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,333
I can't believe you developed
those fighting skills

11
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,000
in such a short time.

12
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:44,416
If I gave you more time,
could you get stronger?

13
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,041
Maybe! Why do you
want to know?

14
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,541
Because there is going
to be a tournament!

15
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,500
Each member of your
team may challenge me.

16
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,333
I will fight them one-on-one.

17
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,458
It should be very entertaining!

18
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,833
[CELL chuckles]

19
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,458
[NARRATOR] Cell has allowed
the young Saiyan live,

20
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,125
but now he must take part
in a deadly tournament

21
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,416
to decide the course
of the future.

22
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,291
The countdown begins...
today on Dragon Ball Z!

23
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,708
[CELL] This tournament
will be a guaranteed hit.

24
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,375
Everyone will be watching me...

25
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,541
I can't wait to see that
look of panic and fear!

26
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,166
That's it! That's the look!

27
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,333
[CELL laughs]

00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,958

[TRUNKS grunts]

32
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,541
[KRILLIN] Hey, look down
there! Is that Trunks?

33
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:42,458
Yeah, that's him.
What's he doing?

34
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:47,541
Hey, where's Cell? He's not
there! He's gone! Where is he?

35
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,916
Hey, wait for me!

36
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,416
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,333
[VEGETA] Tell me,
what happened to Cell?

38
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,750
[TRUNKS] I tried to beat him...
I couldn't do it!

39
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,708
It's okay. Take it easy.
What happened here?

40
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,875
[VEGETA] Tell us what
happened... now!

41
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,375
I lost... his power
is much greater than mine!

42
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,166
[VEGETA laughs]

43
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,125
[VEGETA] Of course it is!

44
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,208
Foolish boy, what made you
think you could take on Cell

45
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,958
now that he's complete?

46
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,958
Hey! Trunks saved
your life, Vegeta,

47
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,958
and already his power
level is way beyond--

48
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,000
No, Krillin!

49
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,458
Huh?!

50
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,958
Hmph?

51
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,083
[PICCOLO growls]

52
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:02,083
[TRUNKS cries]

53
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,625
[BULMA] There, there, now
don't cry, Baby Trunks.

54
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,291
[crying continues]

55
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:08,541
[BULMA] Hey, what
are you waiting for?!

56
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,000
Trunks needs your help!

57
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,166
He could be hurt or even worse!

58
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,625
What's happening
down there anyway?

59
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,916
[PICCOLO] Don't worry,
Trunks is still alive.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,375
Are you sure?!

61
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,916
Huh? And Cell?

62
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,625
[PICCOLO] I thought Trunks was
going to beat Cell for sure.

63
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:30,708
His power had grown to
such an incredible level.

64
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:34,333
Yet, Cell's complete power
was still too much for him.

65
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:37,208
We must find a way to beat Cell!

66
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,750
Perhaps it's time I entered
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber

67
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,666
for some intensive
training of my own.

68
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,166
[KRILLIN] What?
A Martial Arts Tournament?!

69
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,583
Mm-hmm...

70
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
Uh? Are you sure about that?

71
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:58,208
[thinking] Cell! So he wants to
try and humiliate me again.

72
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:01,750
[KRILLIN] So... what's the deal?
Who's gonna be in this?

73
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,166
I mean, nobody can beat Cell,

74
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,916
so it won't be much
of a tournament.

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,375
[TRUNKS] Yes, you're right...
I thought I could beat him.

76
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:12,250
I was certain I could
do it, but I failed.

77
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,333
Maybe he is unstoppable...

78
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,625
Wait! Of course!

79
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:27,291
When Goku and Gohan get out of
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

80
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,625
I'll go back in again
and continue my training!

81
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,541
Huh?!

82
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,375
There's no need
for you to do that!

83
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,250
I will be the one who goes
back inside that room...

84
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
then I'll beat Cell!

85
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,666
[ANDROID 16] I will also fight.

86
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,250
Let me help... You must!

87
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,416
Huh? You're still alive?!

88
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,625
I need help, please take me
to someone who knows

89
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,041
how to repair me.

[ANDROID 16] Once my
circuits are restored,

93
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:10,041
I will fight along side you.
I will, I promise you.

94

No way! You're a
plague to the Earth

other androids!

want to help your kind?!

Stop!

you the help you need.

No, Krillin!

Hey, it's okay... Relax.
He's gonna be one of the

good guys from now on.

103
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,666
[TRUNKS] He's an android!

104
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,583
Yeah, well he's also a
living being, and I think

105
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,333
he deserves a second chance.
Things don't have to happen

106
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,458
like they did in your
time line, Trunks!

107
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,041
An android may save
the world this time!

108
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,833
Come on. You and I both know
we need all the help we can get!

strength to beat Cell.

Ah! Now, let's put that there...

177
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:54,250
Hm? Ahhh...

178
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,916
Uh-Oh! That doesn't look right!

179
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,416
For real? He wants a tournament?

180
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
That's what Cell said.

181
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,958
He told me to watch the
television for details.

182
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,708
Can anyone who wants
enter the competition?

183
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,291
[TRUNKS] He'll take on anyone
who challenges him...

184
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,666
and he expects to have a battle
with each of us. One-by-one.

185
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,916
Of course, you know what
he's trying to do? I do.

186
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,541
His plan is to eliminate the
competition once and for all.

187
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,250
Well, I kinda like the idea of
another Martial Arts Tournament.

188
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,166
I mean, hey...
I think I'll dominate!

189
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, let's get 'em!

190
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,041
Yeah!

191
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,208
Just make sure you
don't get another hand

192
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,375
through your stomach!

193
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,750
[BOTH groan]

194
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,333
[MRS. BRIEF] There ya go!

195
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,875
[MRS. BRIEF giggles]

196
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,583
Hold on... now wasn't there a
martial arts tournament

197
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,750
a long time ago?

198
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,166
That's correct... ahh, yes,

199
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,458
I believe I'll explain since I
once won the tournament myself.

200
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,083
--[VEGETA] Hmph!
--[PUAR] What? Master Roshi?

201
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,583
I never knew you won it!

202
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:06,041
Oh, you just had
to get him started!

203
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,208
[ROSHI coughs]

204
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,541
Alright, I'm sure
you've all heard of the

205
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,666
World Martial Arts Tournament.

206
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,708
It was a contest held to decide
the world's greatest fighter.

207
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,625
Masters of the
Martial Arts gathered

208
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,583
from all over the world to
take place in the competition.

209
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,750
I believe Goku first appeared
in the 21st tournament.

210
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,250
And went all the way
to the final round.

211
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,250
However, his last
opponent was Jackie Chun,

212
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:35,083
an unbeaten master who proved
Goku still had a lot to learn.

213
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,416
Five years later,

214
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,250
the 22nd World Martial
Arts Tournament was held.

215
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,875
That's where Goku met
Tien and Chiaotzu.

216
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,541
It was Goku and Tien
in the final round

217
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,041
and it was a doozy of a battle.

218
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,750
They both gave it
everything they had,

219
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,875
but neither could
out do the other.

220
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,708
Goku narrowly missed
becoming the champion...

221
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,166
and they had to call it a draw.

222
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:01,125
Ha! That's not much
of a competition...

223
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,166
Now I know why
Kakarot got involved

224
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,375
in such an easy tournament.

225
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,000
[KRILLIN &amp; YAMCHA growl]

226
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,958
No... It's not that the
competition was easy...

227
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,958
There were just factors involved
that made it more difficult.

228
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,666
You know, love has a way
of throwing everything

229
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,583
out of perspective.

230
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,208
By the time the 23rd
tournament came around,

231
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,250
Goku had married ChiChi.

232
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,416
Piccolo was on the scene
and showed some moves

233
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,791
that were really
out of this world.

234
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,250
This was a competition
that separated the

235
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,166
tough guys from the wimps.

236
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,666
Goku made it to the finals, but
not before facing some of his

237
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,500
fiercest opponents.

238
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,666
Toughest of all was Piccolo.

239
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,625
Those two fought with everything
they had and it looked like

240
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,250
Piccolo would claim the title
of the world's greatest fighter.

241
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:50,041
But anyone who knows Goku, knows
you can never count him out...

242
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,458
even when things
look their bleakest.

243
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,916
The result of their battle left
the tournament rink destroyed

244
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,791
and the surrounding area
in a shambles.

245
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,083
That's why there hasn't been a
World Martial Arts

246
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,625
Tournament since.

247
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:06,541
In the end, when all was said
and done, Goku was declared

248
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,958
the strongest fighter
on the Earth!

249
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:15,375
10... 12... how many years
ago was that, Krillin?

250
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,291
Quite a few! Heh!

251
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,916
[DR. BRIEF slurps]

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,708
[DR. BRIEF] Interesting story...

253
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,291
Might make a good movie!

254
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,125
[DR. BRIEF slrurps]

255
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,750
[ROSHI sighs]

256
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:32,083
[CROWS cawwing]

257
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,875
But why would Cell
host a tournament?

258
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:37,791
Yeah, why? I mean, if he
wants to rule the world

259
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,666
why's he wasting time
with this competition?

260
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,291
Cell doesn't want to rule the
world, he wants to destroy it.

261
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:46,625
--[YAMCHA gasps]
--[CHIAOTZU] Huh?

262
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,333
The androids have never
been interested in power.

263
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,916
It's just that
they find pleasure

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,166
in causing fear and chaos.

265
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,166
And Cell's no different, he's
using this stupid tournament

266
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,000
as a way to spread fear!

267
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,083
[KRILLIN] Boy,
he's got some nerve!

268
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,875
Don't worry, Krillin.

269
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:05,541
This time we'll knock the wind
out that windbag for good!

270
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,500
[CHIAOTZU] Right!

271
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,458
[VEGETA laughs]

272
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, stop deluding yourselves!

273
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,166
Cell will make short work
out of every one of you.

274
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,625
[YAMCHA growls]

275
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,500
[CHICHI] Well, I for
one am very relieved.

276
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,666
Hey, what's she talking about?

277
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,250
What am I, psychic?!

278
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,125
Don't you understand?

279
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,750
If it's a tournament,
it will have to have rules

280
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,500
that even Cell
must follow, right?

281
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,041
Huh?

282
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,750
[CHICHI] And everyone knows that
in a Martial Arts Tournament

283
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,166
killing is not allowed!

284
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,458
Yeah!

285
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,958
Heh! Well, I have to admit,
she's gotta point!

286
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,583
In that case, I'm in!

00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,833
Would ya stop tryin' to
relive your glorious past?!

289
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,041
It's pathetic--

290

My head!

291
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:52,375
[TRUNKS] Cell wants to test the
limits of his complete body.

292
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,375
He's uncertain about
the Super Saiyans,

293
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,833
and we must use that
to our advantage.

294
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,375
My father, Goku, Gohan, and I

295
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,041
must all try hard
to surprise him.

296
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,750
[KRILLIN] Yeah!
Throw 'im a curve!

297
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,125
Hold it right there!

298
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,541
[ALL gasp]

299
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,083
I have accepted the fact that
Goku will be fighting

300
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,291
in the tournament...

301
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:14,750
But I refuse to let
Gohan take part in it!

302
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,250
[KRILLIN] But ChiChi,
you said yourself

303
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,708
that killing wouldn't be aloud!
So what's the big deal?

304
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,458
[CHICHI] I do not want Gohan
entering that tournament!

305
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,250
He is not going to be a
fighter like his father!

306
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,791
We need him...

307
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,625
Goku and I have already
talked about this.

308
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,875
We made a deal.

309
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,583
Gohan can go and train,
but when he gets back

310
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,208
he's going to have to
buckle down and hit the books.

311
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[KRILLIN] Aw, but ChiChi we
really could use his help!

312
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,041
I've made up my mind about this
and I'm not going to change it!

313
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:48,041
When Gohan was born, Goku and
I both agreed on his future.

314
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,041
His bottle is ready...

315
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,708

a lot, doesn't he?

[GOHAN babbles]

319
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:04,541
Gohan, someday you'll grow
up to be a great scholar.

320
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,958
A scholar?!

321
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:10,375
Goku, there's no reason
for him to have to fight...

322
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,250
If we raise him to be
a scholar, then he'll really

323
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,250
be able to help people.

324
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,041
I guess so...

325
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,916
Guess I'll have to take
back those training weights...

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,791
So there! Gohan will
have to start his studies

327
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,500
right when he gets back...

328
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,500
And he will not be joining
up with your little gang!

329
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,541
Our gang?!

330
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,958

[birds chirping]

335
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,166
Perfect. This looks
like an ideal spot.

336
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,000
Now, to build a ring.

337
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,750

Now, let's see...

339
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,541
I'll have to clear some
of this land away first.

340
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,708
Perfect.

341
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,916
Ah... I like it...
It will make a strong floor.

Yes... This will do just fine...
It looks large enough.

343
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:35,875
It's time, to get the word out.

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,625
[NARRATOR} The stage
has been set.

is about to begin.

will learn where the next
