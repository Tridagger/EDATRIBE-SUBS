1
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,708
Kami finally agreed
to unite with Piccolo.

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,458
No Kami, don't!

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,708
[yells]

5
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,291
[NARRATOR] It was a difficult
decision to say the least,

6
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:29,916
but in his wisdom, and in spite
of the great personal cost,

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,416
Kami chose to do what he felt
was best for the earth!

8
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,875
His fusion with Piccolo
would be a noble sacrifice,

9
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,416
after which Kami
would no longer exist

10
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,625
and Piccolo would
be changed forever.

11
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:53,291
[NARRATOR] Their union complete,
Piccolo stood reborn.

12
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,333
Now that Kami's
vast knowledge and power

13
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,958
had been added to his own,

14
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:59,666
Piccolo was no longer
his former self.

15
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,250
He had become a Super Namek!

16
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,750
I'll miss you. Good-bye, Kami.

17
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,708
Oh... Please be careful.

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,708
No longer am I Kami or Piccolo.

19
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:15,375
I am the Namek who has
long since forgotten his name.

20
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,333
[NARRATOR] While Mr. Popo
bade a final reluctant farewell

21
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,333
to his old friend,
the new and improved Piccolo

22
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,333
made his way down to the earth,

23
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,958
where beneath a
seemingly tranquil surface

24
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:29,041
a sinister evil laid in wait.

25
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:34,125
[NARRATOR] His newfound Super
Namek powers still untested,

26
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,166
Piccolo has come
face to face with the most

27
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,333
diabolical creature
ever to walk the earth!

28
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,500
[NARRATOR]
The fate of the planet

29
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,708
rests on Piccolo's
mighty shoulders!

30
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,083
But is the noble
Namek warrior prepared for

31
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:49,416
what this hideous monster
has in store?

32
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,666
The new face
of evil has arrived!

33
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,041
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

34
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,166
At last we meet...
face to face...

35
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:43,208
[CREATURE growls lowly]

36
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,166
[PICCOLO] Hmmm?!

37
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,083
[CREATURE growls lowly]

38
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:57,250
Hey, you gotta help me,
please! Help me!

39
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,125
What the...?!

40
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,583
What am I sensing
from that thing?!

41
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,541
His... power...

42
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:10,375
I've sensed it
somewhere before!

43
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,750
Please, I beg of you!
You have to help me! Please!

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,625
Please! I'm in more than
a little pain here!

45
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,708
This doesn't look good.

46
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,625
I'm afraid this new monster,
it may be too powerful.

47
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,708
[POPO] Even with
their strengths combined,

48
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,125
Kami and Piccolo may not
be able to win this fight!

49
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,166
[POPO] Oh, Kami...

50
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,833
If there was only
something I could do...

51
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,666
[MAN A] C'mon!
What're you waiting for?!

52
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,500
Help me!

53
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,500
Listen! I'm the
richest man in town

54
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,250
and I'll give you
whatever you want!

55
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,958
Here, take this! And there's
more where that came from!

57
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,750
Hey! Are you listening?!

58
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,375
You would be wise
to let him go.

59
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,041
You've done enough already.

60
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,416
It's time you picked on
someone your own size!

61
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,041
[groans, grunts]

62
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,250
Oh, thank you!
Here, take my money, all of it!

63
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,875
[MAN A] Oh, you saved my life!
I'll give you everything I have!

64
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,083
Oh, thank you!

00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,583

[MAN A gasps, groans]

70
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:34,625
[CREATURE] Now that
we've gotten that vermin

71
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,958
out of the way...

72
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,666
You're next, Piccolo.

73
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,500
[gasps]

74
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,333

Hey, what's eatin' ya, Gohan?

81
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,083
I know it's weird,
but I can sense two Piccolos!

Huh? Two Piccolos?

83
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:32,541

[CREATURE chuckles]

87
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:50,041
What's the matter?
You seem afraid, Piccolo.

88
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,708
No! Far from it, in fact!

89
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,041
Now tell me
how you know that name!

90
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,375
Well... one might say
that we're brothers.

91
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,125
What?!

92
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,875
[laughs]

93
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,916
Ah... Gohan. Are you
sensing what I'm sensing?

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,666
It's... Frieza...!
And his father!

95
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,916
What?! That's ridiculous!

96
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,875
What's going on?

97
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:33,500
My father and Piccolo...
They're in Gingertown...!

98
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:37,500
And if I didn't know better,
I'd say Frieza was with them!

99
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,000
Frieza... He's here
with his father...?

100
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
But that's madness!

101
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,291
No... I sense it too!

102
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,458
But... that's impossible!

103
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:08,083
I thought Trunks destroyed
Frieza and his father!

104
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,916
Yeah, well so did I!

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,875
Me too! But it feels like

106
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,583
they're both alive
and well in Gingertown!

107
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,166

Do you guys feel that?

00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,541
It's... Goku!

I'm nearing section 1051.

That's close to where we found
that weird creature's shell...

117
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,833
and Gingertown!

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,166
Now, if you think you've
finished showing off...

119
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,500
I want answers. Who are you?

Well, we'll see if
you still feel that way

129
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,333
after I've beaten you.

Oh good.
I'm glad I found you.

coming from Gingertown,

156
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,416
and we thought you
might need some help.

Thanks. I was sort of
thinking the same thing.

I'm not really sure
what to make of any of this.

Wait a sec...
Something's happening!

160
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,916
Yeah. I noticed it
a minute ago.

It's a huge power level...

162

but I can't tell whose it is!

[KRILLIN]
Ha-ha! He did it! Yeah!

166
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:07,833
What did he do?

167
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,458
Must've been something
pretty radical

if he's changed this much.

169
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:14,708
That's right, Trunks!
He's united with Kami!

170
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:18,625
[TRUNKS] United? Wait...
You told me about this before!

171
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,958
You said that Piccolo and Kami
were originally one being,

172
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,750
and that if they ever
reunited they'd be

173
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:26,875
even stronger
than a Super Saiyan!

174
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,000
Yep, that's right.
Piccolo's become a Super Namek!

You know, you've made
one critical mistake.

179
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,416
You never should have
emptied this city

180
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,166
of its entire population!

181
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,750
Why is that?

182
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,041
[PICCOLO]
Because as long as there are

183
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,625
no innocent bystanders
to get in the way,

184
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:02,375
I'm free to fight you
with the best of my ability!

185
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,791
[CREATURE]
So what's stopping you?

186
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,541
[PICCOLO] You know,
that's a really good question!

187
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,791
[CREATURE] Hmmm?

188
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:20,416
[grunting]

[gasps]

194
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,166
Well, it looks like
the battle's started!

195
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,666
[KRILLIN] Yeah, no kidding!

196
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,708
I sure hope Piccolo wasn't
on the wrong end of that blast!

197
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,375
[tires screech]

198
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:33,083
[birds chirpping]

199
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,541
Hmmm.

200
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
[ANDROID 18] What was that?

201
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,500
[ANDROID 17] It felt like
some sort of an explosion.

202
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,458
And a big one, too.
I wonder what it was.

203
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,041
It was much too far away
to tell where it came from.

204
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,375
[car door opens]

205
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,333
[ANDROID 16]
It came from Gingertown.

206
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,750
[ANDROID 17 and 18] Hm?

207
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,583
[ANDROID 16] Two enormous
powers are fighting there.

208
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,208
Hm...

209
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,958
[ANDROID 17] You mean your
sensors can detect power levels?

210
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:03,375
Why didn't you
tell us that before?

211
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,791
Because you did not ask!

212
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,208
All right. Fair enough.

213
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:09,583
Now I don't suppose
you can tell me

214
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,500
who it is that's
fighting, can you?

215
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,041
[ANDROID 16] No, I cannot.

216
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,041
I do not recognize
either of these powers.

217
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,583
My sensors indicate
that one of the fighters

218
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,041
is just as strong as you, 17.

219
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,208
What's that?

220
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,958
[ANDROID 16]
My sensors indicate that--

221
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,083
Quiet! I heard what you said
quite clearly the first time.

222
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:32,000
Your "sensors"
must be malfunctioning!

223
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,416
Nobody is as strong as I am.

224
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,750
I'm the most powerful
fighter there is!

225
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:40,291
[ANDROID 17 scoffs]
Really! "As strong as I am!"

226
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,416
[car door slams shut]

227
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,458
[ANDROID 18] Let's go, 16.

00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:17,291
[CREATURE groans]

229
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,333

[PICCOLO grunts]

244
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,750
I must admit...

245
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,833
You're a lot stronger
than I gave you credit for.

246
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,916
But don't let that
go to your head.

247
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
[laughs]

248
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,375
You have yet to see my
true strength.

249
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,291
I was not able to gather
enough energy in this city

250
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,916
to reach my full power.

251
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,708
Your full power?

252
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,666
Ah huh...

253
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,083
Ugh! Monster!

254
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:33,583
That's why you absorbed
all those innocent people!

255
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,041
[chuckles] Yes.

256
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,083
It is their living energy
that gives me my power!

[grunting]

258
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,083
Who are you?!
What kind of a twisted mind

259
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,041
would think to send you here
in that time machine?

260
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,416
Huh?

261
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,416
[PICCOLO] Answer me!

262
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,666
[laughs]

263
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,833
I came here of my own accord!

264
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:56,291
Huh?

265
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:59,041
[CREATURE] The time capsule
was much too small for me

266
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,416
to fit inside
while in my present state.

267
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,916
I was forced to
regress to my larval form

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,291
and enclose myself
within an egg.

269
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,000
Pretty ingenious,
don't you think?

270
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:17,833
[CREATURE] Yes. You seem
to know much, Piccolo.

271
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,125
But there is still
much for you to learn!
