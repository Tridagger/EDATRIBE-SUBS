00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,375
Vegeta powered up
to face the monstrous Cell,

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:21,125
who had finally
reached his perfect form.

4
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,708
[NARRATOR] It was a battle
neither fighter could resist,

5
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:29,375
as both Vegeta and Cell were
anxious to test the extent of

6
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,125
their newfound powers.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,583
[NARRATOR] But as
the fight progressed,

8
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,125
it quickly became clear that

9
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,500
Cell was merely
playing with the Saiyan,

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,833
a realization that made
Vegeta angrier than ever!

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,416
[NARRATOR] But try as he might,

12
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,250
Vegeta couldn't even make the
Android powerhouse flinch.

13
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,541
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's attacks
proved ineffective

14
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,791
against Cell's awesome power,
and our heroes couldn't help

15
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:01,625
but ask themselves
an important question:

16
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,541
Who would be next?

17
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,041
[NARRATOR] Has Vegeta's thirst
for a challenge backfired?

18
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,875
By allowing Cell to
absorb Android 18,

19
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,291
has the Super Saiyan
sealed his own fate?

20
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,416
[CELL chuckles]

21
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,791
[NARRATOR] Vegeta's
pride is on the line.

22
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,000
Will his gamble pay off?

23
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,375
Find out today!

24
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,916
I cannot believe it.

25
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,625
Vegeta dealt him a
direct blow to the head,

26
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,583
yet Cell was not
affected in the least.

27
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,458
[ANDROID 16] Perhaps it is true.

28
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:47,458
Perhaps there is no
limit to Cell's power.

29
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,791
[CELL] What seems
to be the problem?

30
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,000
[CELL] Cat got your tongue?

31
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,083
Im... possible...

[CELL chuckles]

33
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,583
I put all my energy
into that kick!

34
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,875
[CELL] So Vegeta,
do you understand now

35
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,166
what I mean by perfection?

36
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,291
[CELL] Hmm...?

37
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:39,458
Or shall I educate you further?

[VEGETA gasps]

45
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,833
Now look.

46
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,291
You spent all that time saying
I wouldn't be a challenge,

47
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:51,083
and now you're giving
up without a good fight?

48
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,041
That's very rude.

49
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,541
[KRILLIN thinking]
That arrogant monster!

50
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,416
[TRUNKS thinking]
Just you wait, Cell.

51
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,083
If it's a good fight you want,

52
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,375
then it's a good
fight you'll get!

C'mon, Trunks, what
are you waiting for?!

55
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,958
If you take any more time,
Vegeta's gonna be fish food!

56
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,541
It's now or never, bro...

57
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,791
Vegeta may get mad,
but at least he'll stay alive!

58
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,625
Wait!

59
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,708
I can't do anything
to help him until the moment

60
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,375
he loses consciousness.

61
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:34,083
That way, he won't find out

62
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,666
that I've become even
stronger than he is.

63
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,083
Forget his pride!

64
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,458
But I can't!

65
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,041
Huh?!

66
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,916
I don't think you realize how
much honor means to my father...

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,541
It's the only thing
that keeps him going...

68
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:51,125
It's what makes him a warrior...

69
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:55,125
Oh, sure, some might see
it as arrogance, but I think,

70
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,291
down at the core, it's
much more noble than that.

71
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,458
I believe that's what
my mother saw in him...

72
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,250
and it's what I see, too.

73
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,791
I didn't know...

74
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,000
[TRUNKS] How could you?

75
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:15,416
Well... for your sake
I hope he passes out soon.

76
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:28,583
Vegeta... I hate to
interrupt your little nap,

77
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,666
but I think it's time
we should continue.

78

[VEGETA] Why... you...

79
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:41,750
But first, there's one
thing I'd like to mention...

80
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:45,375
I must thank you for sparing
me before I became complete,

regardless of how
utterly foolish it was.

82
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,958
You see, I've been waiting
for this for a long time,

83
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,500

to receive a helping hand.

Oh no! Look! He's not
a Super Saiyan anymore!

194
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,708
Which means... he's either
unconscious... or he's...

195
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,291
Well, you know...

Now, Vegeta, I will end
your miserable life.

Alright! This is it, Trunks!

199
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,416

[CELL] Thank you for
the warm-up, Vegeta.

212
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,333
Your petty efforts were
just enough to get me started.

213
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:19,541
[CELL] Hmm...?

to unleash his true power.

218
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,916
But can the young Saiyan
hold off Cell long enough

219
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,625
to save his
father's life?
