1
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,208
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,666
Vegeta unleashed
his terror

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,833
upon an unsuspecting
Namekian village,

4
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,791
and his conquest has brought
him one step closer

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,125
to achieving his
ultimate goal.

6
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,041
By taking one of
the Dragon Balls

7
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,666
and hiding it in
the watery depths,

8
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,000
Vegeta ensured that
Frieza and his men

9
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,333
would not be able to
gather all seven.

10
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:36,416
Now, there is only one
Dragon Ball left to find,

11
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,833
and then Vegeta can
focus on stealing

12
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:42,916
the five already in
Frieza's possession.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,541
Meanwhile, as events
unfolded on Namek,

14
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,791
Goku raced through space
to meet these deadly foes.

15
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,625
But his intensive
training session

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,541
was unexpectedly
interrupted!

17
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,750
[KING KAI]
Goku, can you hear me?

18
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:58,125
[NARRATOR] It was King Kai!
With exciting news...

19
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,541
You gotta be kidding me!
Everyone made it?

20
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,625
They all reached you together?
That's great, King Kai!

21
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,791
[KING KAI chuckles]

22
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,041
You guessed it!

23
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,291
They're here, and they
want me to train them

24
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,000
even harder than
I trained you!

25
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,250
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues... Today!

26
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,250
[YAMCHA] King Kai,
can I say hello to him?

27
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,666
Of course. Just rest your hand
on my shoulder and speak.

28
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,458
Hey, Goku,
guess who?

29
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,250
Hey! Yamcha! I'm glad
to hear you made it okay!

30
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:41,041
Yeah. The trip down Snake
Way wasn't all that bad.

31
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,333
It's this increased
gravity here

32
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,333
that's gonna be hard
to get used to.

33
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,458
[GOKU] Heh! Believe me,
I know what you mean.

34
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,333
I've been trying to
do some training

35
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,166
under heavy
gravity myself.

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,375
I'm on my
way to meet

37
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,333
Bulma, Krillin, and
Gohan on Planet Namek.

38
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:57,208
And unless I get a lot stronger
in the next five days,

39
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,166
we're gonna be in
serious trouble.

40
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,208
Uh? Why's that?
What's wrong, Goku?

41
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,791
Well, while I was
in the hospital,

42
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,083
Krillin, Bulma, and
Gohan decided to go

43
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,458
to Planet Namek
without me

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,000
so they could start
looking for the Dragon Balls.

45
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,541
But, when they
got there,

46
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,250
they found out that
Vegeta was there, too,

47
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,125
trying to do
the same thing!

48
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:16,416
--[YAMCHA] Oh, no!
--[KING KAI screams]

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,958
What happened? Did
Vegeta try to attack them?!

50
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,333
[TIEN] Huh?

51
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,041
No... Not yet. They've
managed to avoid him so far.

52
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't think he
knows they're there.

53
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,000
But, it gets worse.

54
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:30,125
It looks like there's another
force on the planet.

55
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,541
I don't know
who they are,

56
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,125
but they've been searching
for the Dragon Balls, too.

57
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:35,500
I guess they're
not Saiyans,

58
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,125
even though Bulma says they
wear the same uniforms.

59
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,458
But it sounds like
they're some bad guys.

60
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,250
And, if that
wasn't bad enough,

61
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,750
their leader is supposed to be
even more powerful than Vegeta!

62
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,500
[BOTH] No way!

63
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,125
What's up?
What's going on there?

64
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,875
There's... There's a...
A fighter...

65
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:58,000
Even stronger than
Vegeta on Namek...

66
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,333
You... didn't happen to
catch his name, did you?

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,333
Is it Frieza?

68
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,291
[GOKU] Sorry, I don't know.
Bulma didn't say.

69
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:10,291
[KING KAI whimpering]

70
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:14,750
Well, Goku, I'd better take
a look, just to be sure.

71
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,541
That's great.
Thanks, King Kai.

72
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,958
[KING KAI] Let's see...

73
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,750
I think I get the best
signals from Namek over here.

74
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,750
Yamcha, what does
all this mean?

75
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,458
[KING KAI grunts]

76
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:41,125
I can sense an enormous
power level already!

77
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,500
Now if I can just see
where it's coming from...

78
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,166
Noooo!

79
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,000
It's Friezaaaa!

80
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,333
[ALL gasp]

81
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,500
[GOKU] Hey! What's wrong?
Did you see who it is?

82
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
Goku, listen to me!

83
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the strongest
and fiercest opponent

84
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,291
you could ever face!

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,750
There's no way
you're ready for him!

86
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,083
But... What do you
mean, King Kai?

87
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,208
[KING KAI] I'm not just saying
this for your sake, Goku,

88
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,125
but for all
people everywhere!

89
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,000
You can't
anger Frieza!

90
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,166
If you do, his wrath
will follow us

91
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,958
to the ends of
the universe!

92
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm ordering you not to
go anywhere near him!

93
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
Now, you promise me!

94
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,416
Promise you won't attempt
to face Frieza at any cost!

95
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,208
You can't win.
All you'd do is provoke him!

96
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:44,125
It would be just like hitting
a beehive with a stick!

97
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,000
The best thing you can do is
stay away from him altogether.

98
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,875
But, what about
the Dragon Balls?

99
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,833
I at least
have to try.

100
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,791
No! You have to
promise me! Right now!

101
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,625
Come on...

102
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:58,791
Absolutely nooooot!

103
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,791
Hey. Don't
listen to him.

104
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:08,250
You just get those Dragon Balls
and wish us back to life.

105
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,583
Piccolo!

106
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,250
[PICCOLO] In the meantime,
we'll do some training

107
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,291
with King Kai
to get ready.

108
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,208
Yeah!

109
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,375
Between you, me,
Gohan, and Krillin,

110
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,458
we should be able
to handle this guy.

111
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,166
[KING KAI grunts]

112
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,291
No! You don't have any idea
what you're talking about!

113
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,291
[PICCOLO] There's no time
to waste. Start training us.

114
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,083
[KING KAI] No way! Not if
you're going to fight Frieza!

115
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:35,125
Promise you won't! That's
the only way I'll teach you!

116
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,375
All right.

117
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:43,750
I hope you mean that.
I'm trusting you.

118
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,208
And all of
you, too!

119
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,750
[ALL] Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,166
[thinking] Heh, heh, heh.
He's crazy if he thinks

121
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,916
I'm gonna stick
to that promise.

122
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,291
[thinking] I've got to train
hard, just like Goku.

123
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,541
His strength increased
so much it was amazing.

124
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,291
For us to face
this Frieza,

125
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,541
we'll all have to
be at our best.

126
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,625
Hmph.

127
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,500
Good. Now, let's
get started.

128
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,125
[thinking] I've been waiting
for this training forever.

129
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,208
[thinking]
Show me what you've got.

130
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,750
[KING KAI] Are you sure
you're ready for this?

131
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,083
[YAMCHA] Hmm.

132
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,208
Fine, in that case...

133
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,166
Then your first challenge
is to make me laugh!

134
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,500
You don't make me laugh,
I don't train you! Got it?

135
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,958
[ALL gasp]

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,791
Okay, even if don't
fight this Frieza,

137
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,125
he didn't say I
couldn't keep training!

138
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:54,708
Alright! Let's see what I can
do under thirty-times gravity!

139
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,833
Hey, so if we keep on
flying at this speed,

140
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:09,208
how long will it 
take us to get there?

141
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,541
Well... I'd guess
about five more hours.

142
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
[KRILLIN sighs]

143
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,250
Bah! I should've
been able to sense

144
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,916
some more of these
Nameks by now!

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,166
Where are they?

146
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,208
There must be a village
around here somewhere!

147
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,666
[thinking] Wait a second.
I do sense something.

148
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,458
It's faint, but there's
two of them moving.

149
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,750
And they're not
with Frieza.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,458
Interesting. Let's see
where they're headed.

151
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,583
[NARRATOR] And so, the
great joke contest began.

152
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,750
[KING KAI laughing]

153
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,750
[NARRATOR] Yamcha and
Chiaotzu proved themselves

154
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:57,333
to be quite
the comedians.

155
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,791
However, Tien and
Piccolo are having

156
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,250
a much more difficult time
getting King Kai to laugh.

157
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:08,208
[PICCOLO scoffs]

158
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,125
I... quit.

159
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,958
[CHIAOTZU] C'mon, Tien.
You can't give up.

160
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,708
Use this one.

161
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,208
[whispering]

162
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,416
[KING KAI] Huuuh...?

163
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,208
I don't know. Doesn't
sound very funny to me.

164
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,416
It'll work!

165
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,166
Trust me, that joke's
right up his alley!

166
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,541
All right.

167
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,291
I'm ready.

168
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,833
Go Tien!
Make him laugh!

169
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:47,666
Let's do it.

170
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:50,833
Your move.

171
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,500
[BOTH whimper]

172
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:01,166

Ehh...

[thinking] I've never
felt pressure like this.

181
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,541
I must focus. Focus.

182
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:25,041

[TIEN] Did you catch all
of that?! Huh, King Kai?!

00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:57,208

I told you you can be funny!

It's Vegeta!
He must have sensed us!

00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,041
He's heading this
way! And fast!

205

He'll be here
any second!

Huh? Uh...

Uh... What's going on?
Why'd he take off like that?

Huh?!

There's another
big power level...

215

be after him!

It's Zarbon! I'm sure of it!
And he's alone. Perfect.

217
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:54,416
Without Frieza to protect
him, he'll be easy prey!

Your first
training exercise

244
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,875
will be to try
to catch Bubbles.

245
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,458
Uh... You're kidding me!
That's it?

246

Kay, piece of cake!

00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:56,458
You think so?
I'll have you know,

248
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,708
it took Goku almost
three weeks to do it.

to catch a monkey.

Question!

253

Uh, yes?

254
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,541
So if we catch the monkey,
does that mean we're ready

255
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,708
to start the real
training with you?

256
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,083
Not quite. If you
can handle Bubbles,

257
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,875
we'll see how you
fare against Gregory.

258
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,750
And then I'll know if you're
ready for my teaching.

259

do you say

we get on to the real

Oh well, I can tell
you one thing:

298

You guys have a lot to learn
learn about comedy! Sheesh...

kill that old Namek

300

for destroying
our scouters.

So. We finally meet again,

the same thing to you.

beat Dodoria by yourself!

you say, Zarbon...

It's easy
enough to prove.

If you don't believe me, why
don't you try me for yourself?

312
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,541
You're a fool.

313
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,541
You should know better
than to disobey Frieza.

314
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:01,208
Yes, so I've heard.
But unlike you,

315
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,125
I've never been suited to the
life of a mindless follower.

I'm through
taking orders.

317
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm through cowering
before Frieza like a dog.

318
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,791
And I intend to see
him grovel at my feet,

319
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,625
as soon as I've
made my wish!

320
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,125
You mean with the
Dragon Balls.

321
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,500
The winds of change
are blowing, Zarbon.

322
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,041
Soon, the power of
immortality will be mine!

323
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,708
And with it, I will
rule this galaxy forever!

324
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,666
[ZARBON] You're dreaming! Frieza
already has five Dragon Balls.

325
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,666
It won't take us long
to find the rest.

326
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,666
[VEGETA] Please. You're
blind without your scouters.

327
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,041
That's a liability
I don't share.

328
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,041
My powers have
improved in more ways

329
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,791
than you could
ever imagine.

[ZARBON chuckles]

331
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,750
So you've learned some
new tricks, then?

332
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,291
It doesn't
change a thing.

333
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,791
What makes you think
your abilities

334
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,583
even hold a candle
to Frieza's?

335
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,333
I'd say you already know
the answer to that question!

336
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
Dodoria did too!

337
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,000
And before he died,
he told me everything!

338
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,833
Frieza fears
the Saiyans!

339
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:00,916
Which means,
he's afraid of me!

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,208
Don't flatter yourself.

341
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,958
What Frieza feared was
the entire Saiyan race

342
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,500
rising up
against him.

343
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,375
All alone, you're
no threat to anyone.

344
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,750

00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,708
[ZARBON grunts]

350
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,625
[ZARBON]
Haaaah!

351
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,541
[VEGETA chuckles]

352
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,625
Rraaahh!

353
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,416
[ZARBON gasps]

354
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,875
You surprise
me, Vegeta.

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,166
Whoa... Those power
levels are incredible!

356
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,083
I guess that's where Vegeta
ran off to in such a hurry.

357
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,666
Yeah, that's
him all right.

358
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,875
He must be fighting one of
Frieza's goons or something.

359
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,083
Well, good.
I say let 'em fight.

360
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,416
Maybe we'll get lucky and
they'll take each other out.

361
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,208
'Cause if either
one finds us...

362
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,750
[DENDE whimpering]

363
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,500
[KRILLIN] Hey!

364
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,458
Hang on tight, kid!

365
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,583
We gotta move!
If we turn up the speed,

366
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,291
we might be able to get
to the Eldest Namek

367
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,708
while they're
still fighting!

368
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's hope
they're too busy

369
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,833
beating each other
up to notice!

370
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,833
[ZARBON grunting]

371
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,416
[VEGETA laughing]

372
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,541
[ZARBON grunting]

373
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,083
[ZARBON gasps]

374
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,583
[ZARBON gasps]

375
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:55,916
[VEGETA]
Hyah!

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,583
[ZARBON grunting]

377
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:04,625
[VEGETA laughing]

378
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:08,291
[VEGETA] Well, I think I
proved my point, Zarbon!

379
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:12,041
[ZARBON whimpering]

380
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:13,958
[VEGETA chuckles]

381
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:20,708
[whimpering becomes chuckling]

382
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:21,958
Hmm...?

383
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:28,083
[ZARBON laughing]

384
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:30,041
[ZARBON]
Well, I have to admit...

385
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,791
You do impress me, Vegeta.

386
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,875
Your fighting skills
have come a long way

387
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,166
since the last time we met,
but not quite far enough!

388
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,958
[ZARBON chuckling]

389
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,500
[NARRATOR] Even with
all of his might,

390
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,333
it seems
Vegeta's attacks

391
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,541
have had little effect
on the terrifying Zarbon.

392
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,208
Has the Saiyan prince
finally met his match?

393
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:55,416

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
