00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:20,041
two androids, 19 and 20,
appeared on an island

3
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:22,458
nine miles southwest
of South City,

4
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
just as Trunks had predicted.

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,250
It was a violent arrival,

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,208
marked by devastating
destruction and

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,875
the presence of a
certain super hero

8
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,041
who was there to stop them!

9
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,625
But when a harsh blow
from Goku did little more

10
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,208
than knock the android's
hat off, it was clear

11
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,916
that the Saiyan was
up against an enemy

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,416
of incredible strength.

13
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,333
In addition,
the android revealed

14
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,958
that their creator had already
studied Goku's strength

15
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,500
and technique and had
consequently equipped them

16
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,250
with superior abilities!

17
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,416
[NARRATOR] But Doctor Gero's
research didn't span

18
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,375
into far reaches of space,
and there was one ability

19
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:00,000
of Goku's that he
hadn't accounted for!

20
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:04,500
[GOKU yells]

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:08,000
[NARRATOR] His ability to
transform into a Super Saiyan!

22
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:10,958
Yes...

23
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,250
It is a most
impressive ability.

24
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,000
But it is nothing
we cannot handle.

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,791
19 will demonstrate
this by himself.

26
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,875
Hmm.

27
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,125
Hah! Alright,
have it your way,

28
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,375
but I wouldn't bank on
it if I were you!

29
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,250
[GOKU growls]

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:32,000
[NARRATOR] Goku's clash with
the androids continues today!

00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,666
[GOKU] Hm?!

[ANDROID 20 gasps]

48
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,666
That's it, Goku!

49
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,875
[PICCOLO] Hmm.

[ROSHI laughs]

58
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:33,750
[ROSHI] Oh, dear me! What
will they think of next?!

59
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,625
[OOLONG groans]

60
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,000
[ROSHI] Huh...?

61
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,458
[OOLONG] Whoa!

62
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,458
Oh, Tien... I hope
you're safe...

63
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:45,750
[MARON] Hello in
there! Knock, knock!

64
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,583
Krillin, it's me!

65
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,666
[OOLONG] Hm?

66
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,541
[MARON] Your Maron
is back! Yoo-hoo!

67
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,416
Oh, no! Where is he?

68
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Where's Krillin?

69
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,291
Oh, uh, he left a
little while ago!

70
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:03,166
They're off trying to save the
world from annihilation again!

71
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,208
You know how it is!

72
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,833
Hm?!

73
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:10,125
Hi, pretty plant!
What's your name?

74
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:12,791
Have you seen Krillin?

75
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,291
Nice branches, huh?

76
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,875
[ROSHI chuckles]

77
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,916
[MARON]
Yes, it's a beautiful plant,

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,708
but it's sad that it doesn't
know where Krillin is!

79
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,166
[MARON groans]

80
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,750
[ROSHI giggles lecherously]

81
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,166
[ROSHI] Give us a hug, baby!

82
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,791
[ROSHI chuckles]

83
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,916
[ROSHI muffled giggles]

84
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,916
Oh?

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,416
[CHIAOTZU] We know where he is,

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,583
it's just too
dangerous to go there!

87
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,625
Gosh! My Krillin's in danger!

88
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:46,000
I should have never left him.
He was so good to me...

89
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:50,708
With that cute little round head
of his and all of those muscles!

90
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,666
I didn't know what
love was 'til I met him!

91
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,583
[MARON sobs]

92
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,041
[MARON] Please take me back!

93
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,500
Oh, Krillin...

94
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,791
Come back!

95
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,791
[MARON sobs]

96
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:11,125
Oh, no... My poor, dear Krillin.

97
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,500
He's lost. But I won't give up.

98
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,750
Where are you, Krillin?!

99
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,416
Please... No...

100
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,083
Don't do this to me! I need you!

101
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,625
Krillin?

102
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,250
Maron, he's not lost!

103
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,041
Krillin's off fighting
some androids

104
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,833
made by the leader of
the old Red Ribbon Army!

105
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:35,875
What? Red ribbon?
Oh, my goodness!

106
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,208
Krillin! You sensed I was coming

107
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,250
so you went out to get
a red ribbon for me!

108
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,916
[ALL shout]

109
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,541
[CHIAOTZU] After he warned us,

110
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,375
he got right back in his
time machine and took off!

111
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,375
Then the Androids showed up,
just like he said they would!

112
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,708
Three years later!

113
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,875
Which means he was
telling the truth!

114
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:03,541
What a fight! You
talk about power!

115
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,750
We're usually right
there with those guys.

116
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,500
Darn shame. We feel left out.

117
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,625
But... I... want...
my... Krillin now!

118
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,333
Ohh-ho!

119
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,958
Okay! Okay! He'll be back soon!

120
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,041
I promise, it
won't be long now!

121
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,416
But allow me to keep you
company in the meantime.

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,875
Will you tell me the story
about the Red Ribbons again?

123
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,375
Well, that's not exactly
what I had in mind...

124
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,583
[MARON] Please?

125
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,500
[ROSHI] Oh, all right.

126
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:31,666
It all started back when
Goku was still just a boy.

127
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,708
He was on a mission to
collect all seven Dragon Balls!

128
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,291
It was a training mission,
designed to sharpen his skills.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,041
There's one up ahead.

130
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:51,000
[ROSHI] Little did Goku know,
that the Red Ribbon Army

131
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,541
was also after the Dragon Balls
for their own evil purposes!

132
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,416
Thanks to Dr. Gero,
the chief scientist,

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,750
this dreadful organization had
radically advanced robotics

134
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:01,750
at their disposal!

135
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:08,708
Ka... me... ha... me...

136
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,833
Haaaaa!

137
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,666
[MAJOR METALLICA screams]

138
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,041
[ROSHI] Luckily,
Goku was no ordinary boy.

139
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,083
Or he would have
perished for sure!

140
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,541
Wow! I just knocked
his block off!

141
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,083
And he's still standing!

142
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,791
What a guy...

143
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:27,083
[ROSHI] General Tao was Goku's
most dangerous adversary by far!

144
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,666
He was a true master
of the Martial Arts!

145
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,958
But like so many others,

146
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:34,458
his power only made him
hunger for more power!

147
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,125
The mastermind behind all
of the Red Ribbon Army's

148
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,833
military operations, he
wanted nothing less

149
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,666
than to rule the world!

150
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,000

[GOKU yelps]

152
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,375
[ROSHI] And he would have had
his way if it wasn't for Goku.

153
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:53,833
[GOKU] Ka... me... ha...

154
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,541
--[GENERAL TAO] Hmm...?
--me... haaaaa!

155
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,333
[ROSHI]
General Tao never expected that

156
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,541
such an advanced attack would
come from such a small boy!

157
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,083
He was speechless!

158
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,333
Not bad... I'm impressed!

159
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,541
Unbelievable!

160
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,000
Your turn!

161
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,958
--Raagh!
--[GOKU screams]

162
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:21,625
[GOKU grunts]

163
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:23,083
[GENERAL TAO gasps]

164
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,541
You're just a big bully!

165
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,541
I'm not scared of
you anymore, Tao!

166
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,875
[ROSHI] Then Goku gave
him the old duck and go

167
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,291
and winded the General!

168
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,833
Ooh, it wasn't
pretty after that.

169
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,416
Goku brought the hammer down

170
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,416
and treated the General's head
as if it were a punching bag!

171
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,875
[ROSHI laughs]

172
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,458
[ROSHI] Goku knocked
the General silly,

173
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,041
even had him
begging for mercy!

174
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,166
I'll change! I promise!

175
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,750
[ROSHI] But it was just a trick!
A shameless trick by an old pro!

176
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:55,250
Haaa!

177
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,750
[GOKU yells]

178
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,833
[ROSHI] The General jumped
straight up to avoid the blast,

179
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,166
but Goku kicked that
thing sky-high.

180
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,708
And that was the end
of one of the foremost

181
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:07,583
Martial Arts experts
in the world.

182
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,625
Now, if you
considered General Tao

183
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,833
to be the heart of
the Red Ribbon Army,

184
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,375
then Doctor Gero would have
to be considered the brain!

185
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
[ROSHI] Goku still
had work to do.

186
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,541
And in a classic style that
could only work for someone

187
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,291
as strong and as
crazy as Goku was,

188
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,916
he attacked the entire
Red Ribbon Army head on!

189
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,833
[GOKU yells]

190
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,333
[SOLDIER 1] Hey, kid!
Say cheese!

191
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,375
Okay, "cheese"!

192
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,875
[SOLDIER 1 screams]

193
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,208
[ROSHI] Little by little, Goku
was doing the impossible!

194
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,625
[ROSHI] He was chipping away

195
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,416
at the Red Ribbon Army
singlehandedly!

196
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,458
Fools! I want him stopped!
He's just a stinkin' kid!

197
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,458
[ROSHI] It was inconceivable
that such a small boy

198
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,916
could have such enormous power!

199
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,750
[GOKU yells]

200
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,333
[ROSHI] Soon, there was
only one man standing

201
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:18,416
between Goku and
Doctor Gero himself!

202
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,333
[ROSHI] But with the help of
one of Dr. Gero's machines,

203
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:25,625
he was able to gain
the upper hand on Goku!

204
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,291
He knocked the poor boy
senseless for starters,

205
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,791
and then he gave
him the hot pants!

206
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,083
[GOKU yells]

207
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:38,333
[ROSHI] Things weren't looking
too good for ol' Goku!

208
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,375
[GENERAL BLACK] Here, I have
a little surprise for you, kid!

209
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:45,958
Why am I not excited?

210
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:48,208
[ROSHI] So Goku did
what he usually does

211
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,000
when he's plum out of options:

212
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,375
[GENERAL BLACK]
Stay right there... Perfect.

213
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,666
[ROSHI] He used his head!

214
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,416
Let's see whose head is harder!

215
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,083
[GOKU grunts]

216
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,041
[GOKU yells]

217
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,500
[GENERAL BLACK screams]

218
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,375
[ROSHI] And that was that!

219
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:07,083
The entire Red Ribbon
Army was no more!

220
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,125
[GOKU] Flying Nimbus!

221
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,583
[ROSHI] They had been defeated
by a mere boy,

222
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,708
a very special boy mind you,
but, a boy, nonetheless!

223
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,750
[ROSHI] Well, this made quite
an impression on the mastermind

224
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,291
behind the Red Ribbon Army,

225
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,250
Doctor Gero, who
Goku let get away!

226
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,166
He was no longer interested in

227
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,375
creating an entire army anymore.
What was the use if only one boy

228
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,416
could destroy the whole thing?!

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,125
Instead, he was bent
on using his genius

230
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,666
to create a robotic
being like Goku.

231
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,583
A single entity that had the
power of an entire army.

232
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,208
But he knew that any creation
he made had to be even stronger

233
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,625
than Goku, or Goku
would simply beat it again!

234
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:55,083
So he secretly watched Goku over
the years and studied his power!

235
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,166
Finally, he invented a
pair of killing machines

236
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,958
that he felt were even
stronger than Goku!

237
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,041
And this marked the end
of Doctor Gero's dark,

238
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,625
but brilliant, career!

239
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:09,583
His new creations were so evil
that they took the Doctor's life

240
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,125
the second they awoke
into the world...

241
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,875
[ROSHI] And that's
the whole scoop, Maron!

242
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,208
Right now, Krillin is
with Goku and Gohan

243
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,708
and they're trying to stop
those crazy monsters!

244
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,333
Quite a tale, huh?

245
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,166
Do you think you
understand it now?

246
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,666
Umm...

247
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,625
No! Who'll protect me
from the monsters?

248
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,333

249
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,208
Whoa! Man! I can feel
that energy big time!

250
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,833
That's my dad, isn't it?

251
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:52,125
Yeah! I can't
sense the androids.

252
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:53,750
I guess you were right
about not being able

253
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,458
to sense their power levels...

Man, Goku's all over that thing!

259
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,708
He's dominating! There's no
way that android can win,

260
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,541
he hasn't even touched him yet!
Goku's got it in the bag!

261
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,166
Maybe...

greatly exceed anything
I had anticipated!

275
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,583
If the opportunity does
not soon arise for 19

276
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,458
to steal some energy, he will
drain his power reservoir

277

[TIEN] No kidding!
Look at him go!

He's rewriting history up there!

It looks like we're all
going to live afterall!

even worried anymore!

Goku's just not his
usual confident self!

His attacks aren't even
hurting the android!

He's going to need
our help, you guys!

Hey, wait a sec. He seems
fine. You're being paranoid.

for some reason!

He's going to give out
if this keeps up!

Yeah, right. I can see it too.

314
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,750
Hey, guys! Remember
what Yamcha said

315
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,000
about feeling weak when
the android touched him?

316
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,875

absorbing his energy?

00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,208

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,791
They absorb energy
through their hands!

354
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,250
It will only make them
stronger! Understand?!

355
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,833
You're kidding!

356
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:19,208
Great... Now what?
Oh, man... That's too much!

357
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,708
[ANDROID 19 laughs]

358
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,458
[ANDROID 20 chuckles]

359
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,166
Uh, oh... Look,
guys, it's...

360
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,666
Goku, he's tired! Man...

361
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,250
How did that thing take
so much of his energy?

362
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,791
I don't think it did.

363
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,041
Something else must be
sapping all his strength!

364
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,458
[GOHAN gasps]

365
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:42,791
[thinking] Excellent!
Now 19 is fully charged again

366
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,916
and it seems that
Goku's new technique

367
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,666
is taking its toll
on him! Yes... Yes!

368
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,333
The "mighty" Goku is finished!

369
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,791
[ANDROID 19 grunts]

370
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,375
Hmph.

[GOKU yells]

378
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,458
Ka-me-ha-me

379
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,666
Goku! No!

380
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,416
[GOKU] Ha...

381
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,125
Dad... Something's wrong...

382
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,250
[GOKU growls]

383
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,375
Darn! What's wrong?!

384
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:39,875
I can't... give... up!

385
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:44,125
[GOKU grunts]

386
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:47,666
[YAMCHA] I don't believe it!
Goku's backing off!

387
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,375
[KRILLIN] He must
be hurt really bad!

388
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,208
[YAMCHA] But how?!

389
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,083
Daddy...

[GOHAN yells]

392
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:06,166
It's that virus! It's
attacking his heart right now!

393
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,458
Father!

394
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes! That's it!

395
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,500
But it's happening much later
than the boy from the future

396
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,708
said it would!

397
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,541
Goku just thought that
he'd made a mistake,

398
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,416
but somehow his visit has
already changed history!

399
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,166
Man...

400
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,708

[NARRATOR] As the Androids
look on like vultures,

406
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,666
the deadly virus attacks
Goku from within.

407
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,458
Trunks' prediction is
finally coming true,

408
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:41,208
but at a most unexpected
and inopportune time.

409
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,333
What will Goku do now?

410
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,625
And how long does he have

411
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:47,291
before the deadly
virus runs its course?

00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:52,166
