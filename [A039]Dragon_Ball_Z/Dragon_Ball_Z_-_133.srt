00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,666
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,916
Bulma made a shocking discovery.

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,375
The maniacal Android
20 is none other

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,416
than Dr. Gero himself.

5
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
And he's not about to
surrender without a fight.

6
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,041
In a final desperate
attempt to escape,

7
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,291
the diabolical doctor unleashed
a powerful energy blast

8
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,666
that sent Bulma
into a tailspin!

9
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,208
[BULMA screams]

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,666
NARRATOR] Much to the relief
of Tien, Gohan, and Krillin,

11
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,291
however, Trunks, the
boy from the future,

12
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,375
was on the scene to
perform a daring rescue.

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,958
--[BABY TRUNKS cries]
--[BULMA] Wow! I'm still alive!

14
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,625
--[BABY TRUNKS cries]
--Ah! Where's my baby?!

15
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,208
[NARRATOR] But unlike Bulma,
Vegeta was none too happy

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,208
to see Trunks again,
for it seemed

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,625
that the young
Saiyan's predictions

18
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,208
had been less than accurate.

19
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,625
[TRUNKS] The timeline as I
know it must have shifted!

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,875
[NARRATOR] Vegeta flew off
to challenge the androids

21
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,125
on his own, but Trunks was
determined to stop him.

22
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,625
For although history may
have been slightly altered,

23
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,708
terrible dangers
still lie lay ahead!

24
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,958
[PICCOLO] We're really
going to have to move fast!

25
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
[TIEN] Right!

26
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,583
[NARRATOR] Dr. Gero
races to his laboratory

27
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,708
to activate the fearsome
Androids 17 and 18.

28
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,458
And unless our
heroes can stop him,

29
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:23,291
it could mean the
end of the world.

30
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,958
[TRUNKS thinking]
I can't believe my father

31
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,250
is so stubborn and
self-centered!

32
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,041
If that's the case, then we
might just have a chance

33
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:58,291
to find this lab and destroy
the other two androids

34
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:01,458
before Gero even gets there!

35
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,000
I would never do
something that cowardly!

36
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,500
[TRUNKS gasps]

37
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,916
Only one course of action
can possibly satisfy me!

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,083
I will fight these
androids face-to-face!

39
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,458
And I will break them
with my bare hands!

40
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,958
You must never
underestimate the power

41
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,583
of the androids!

42
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
If you really want
to destroy them,

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,500
we have to do this
Piccolo's way!

44
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,208
[VEGETA chuckles]

45
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,416
[thinking]
Unless I can stop him,

46
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,000
his arrogance is going
to get him killed!

47
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,750
[thinking] Don't these
fools understand?

48
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,708
I am one of the Saiyan elite!

49
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:39,250
And now that I'm a Super Saiyan,
my powers are second to none!

50
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,541
Hmph! "Wait for
Kakarot" indeed!

51
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,000
I will grind these
Androids into dust!

on a little longer...

[TIEN] Not yet, but we
should be getting really close!

There!

00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,458
[PICCOLO] Yes!
That's it all right!

North City...

93
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,166
So which one of
these mountains looks

94
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,125
like the best place to
put a lab to you guys?

95
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,750
[VEGETA] Would you
stop following me, boy?!

96
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,666
You're getting on my nerves!

97
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,083
[TRUNKS] Sorry, but there's
no way I'm going to let you

98
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,416
fight the Androids on your own!

99
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,583
And just what are you
planning to do to stop me?

100
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,416
It's going to take more than
that little sword of yours

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,625
to stand in my way!

102
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,375
How many times
do I have to tell you

103
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,666
before it sinks into
your thick skull?!

104
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,416
Never underestimate the
power of the androids!

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,958
Ha! And never underestimate
a true Super Saiyan

106
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,250
who loves taking
on a challenge.

107
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,083
Well, if you're
going to stay,

108
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,916
you can at least help
me find Dr. Gero's lab!

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,583
[TRUNKS growls]

110
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,916
You are
totally impossible!

111
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,333
Could you
hurry up, Gohan?

112
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,500
My arms are getting tired!

113
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:14,750
Really! Would you stop
your belly-aching already?!

114
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,583
You're just along for the ride!

115
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,333
It's poor Gohan who's
doing all the work!

116
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,416
It's okay, Bulma...

117
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,041
I'm just sick of
Yajirobe's whining!

118
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,375
Trunks, when you grow up,

119
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
I hope you turn out to
be just like Gohan!

120
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,000
[BABY TRUNKS giggles]

121
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:33,083
[GOHAN] Well, you don't
have to worry about him!

122
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,666
From what I've seen, I'd say the
grown-up Trunks is pretty cool!

123
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,708
[BULMA] You're right!
He is cool, isn't he?

124
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,500
He's not that cool...

125
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:42,833
What'd you say?!

126
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,458
--[YAJIROBE &amp; GOHAN gasp]
--[BULMA] How dare you

127
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,125
say something like
that about my son?!

128
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,666
[GOHAN] I'm losing
control, Bulma!

129
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,208
[BULMA] What're you
saying?! It's my fault?!

130

[grunting]

132
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,125
Gee whiz, Bulma,

133
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,125
do you think you could
freak out any more?

134
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,541
What?!

135
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,375
Well, we'll just tell
Daddy about him!

136
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,208
No, don't! Not Vegeta!
Please! I take it back!

137
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,333
[GOHAN] Heh, heh!
Watch out, Yajirobe!

138
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,458
Little Trunks is going to
be pretty tough himself

139
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,458
one of these days!

140
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,041
He may come after
you if he hears

141
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,708
you were giving his
mom a hard time!

142
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,833
[YAJIROBE] Yeah! I'd
like to see him try...

143
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,750
[BULMA] Oooh, that does it!

144
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,166
I'm going to tell Vegeta
exactly how mean

145
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,416
you're being to his son!

146
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,250
[YAJIROBE whimpers]

147
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,291
No, you can't tell!
I'll do anything!

148
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,916
[GOHAN] What do you have against
Trunks anyway, Yajirobe?

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,958
He's the one who warned
us about the Androids,

150
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,458
and he may have
saved my dad's life

151
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,416
by bringing him that
medicine from the future!

152
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,791
[YAJIROBE] Well, I... uh... I--

153
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,666
[BULMA] That's right!
My Trunks is a good boy!

154
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,250
Yes you are!

155
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,625
I just hope that medicine really
works like he said it would...

156
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,583
[BULMA] Don't worry, Gohan!
Your dad's going to be fine!

157
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,250
[GOHAN] Well, I've got to know
for sure! Hang on!

--[BULMA screams]
--[YAJIROBE yells]

159
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,041
[TIEN] You know,
I didn't exactly think

160
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,833
that finding Dr. Gero's
lab would be easy...

161
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,208
But this? This is ridiculous!

162
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,833
I mean, considering the
fact that we can't sense

163
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,833
the androids' power
and the fact that we have

164
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,916
about a million
mountains to choose from,

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,750
I'd say it just
might take a while.

166
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,041
I say we split up and
whoever finds the lab first

167
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,750
sends out a signal.

168
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,208
What kind of signal did you
have in mind, Piccolo?

169
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:32,541
Raise your power level
so we can all sense it.

170
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,416
[KRILLIN whimpers]

171

Oh man, it's
freezing up here!

172
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,041
I know... But this is
no time to complain!

173
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,625
Just one more reason I'm
glad I'm not an Earthling.

174
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,875
Now we'd better get moving!
We don't have much time!

175
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,875
Okay, let's do it! I'll head
a little further north

176
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,000
and see what I
can find up there.

177
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,166
Hey, wait a sec!

178
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,916
What's the problem now?!

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,750
[KRILLIN] Nothing. I just
thought it'd be a good idea

180
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,375
if I gave you some Senzu
Beans before you went!

181
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,041
Oh yeah... Good call!

182
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,291
[KRILLIN] I've got
exactly six beans left.

183
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,958
That means we get two each.

184
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:11,875
Here's yours...

185
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:13,625
and here's yours.

186
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,458
[PICCOLO] Thanks, Krillin,
but let's just hope

187
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,166
we don't have to use them.

188
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,708
Just as I had hoped.

189
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,791
Those meddlesome fools are still
searching for my laboratory!

190
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,166
It will take them
hours to find it!

191
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,208
And by then it will be too late.

200
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,875
What happened to you?

201
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,166
Cra-zy old guy...

202
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,083
Dr. Gero!

203
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,708
Which way did he go?

[HUNTER] Hey, where
are you going?!

00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,583
You can't leave me
like this! Hello?!

208
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,166
[thinking] That "Krillin"
may have spotted me.

209
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,500

easily dealt with.

Huh?

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,000
[KRILLIN] A-ha!
Dr. Gero's footprint!

222
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,750

happen when you found me?

00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:21,833
I must get to my lab
before he finds it!

236
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:26,250
I will spare your life for now,
but only for a moment.

238

I've got to...

I've got to let
the others know...!

I've got to find that lab!

[DR. GERO laughs]

246
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,416
[DR. GERO] It seems I
have won this little race.

[DR. GERO growls]

250
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,208
Yes, I've found it!

251
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,291
But I've got to hurry
and tell the others!

252
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,708
You are too late, human!

253
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,416
There is nothing that you
or your friends can do

254
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,875
to stop me now.

255
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,875
Oh no! I'd better
send out the signal!

[KRILLIN growls]

257
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,875
Piccolo, Tien! I've found it!

[PICCOLO] Huh...?

259
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,208
It's Krillin!

260
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,958
What's going on?!

261
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,791
I had hoped to avoid
activating them again so soon,

262
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:48,416
but it seems the time to put my
androids to the test has come!

263
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,750
I no longer have a choice.

264
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:27,250
Ah, yes... Android 17!

265
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:38,125
Dr. Gero. How are you today?

266
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:42,708
Good. Good! You remember me!

267
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,833
Of course. You gave
me life, Doctor.

268
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,083
[DR. GERO] Yes!

269
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,166
[thinking] It appears 17
is functioning properly.

270
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,375
And now for 18!

271
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:23,166
Hello, Doctor.
How have you been?

272
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,083
Good! So you
remember me too, 18!

273
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,458
How could I forget?

274
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,708
[thinking] Excellent!

275
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,666
They both seem to be in
perfect working order!

276
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,625
I see that you have chosen
to become an android...

277
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,958
[DR. GERO] Yes. Now I
have eternal life like you.

278
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,000
But we have pressing
matters at hand.

279
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,125
In the past, the two
of you have displayed

280
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,000
an unacceptable tendency
to disobey my orders.

281
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,833
I blame myself for this,
and the way I programmed you.

282
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,541
I have since modified your
programming, however.

283
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:59,708
And I will no longer
tolerate insubordination!

284
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,750
Now then, listen closely.

285
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:06,166
Several of Goku's friends are
presently outside our door.

286
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,416
You are to destroy
them immediately.

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,125
Yes.

288
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,583

mountain is the entrance!

292
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,375
Right! Good job, Krillin!

Ah, thanks, Tien!

294

You can pat each other
on the back later.

295
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,708

[TIEN] What's the
matter now, Krillin?!

300
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,666
[KRILLIN] I... forgot
to mention one thing.

told us before, Krillin!

realize what awaits them.

isn't it Dr. Gero?

323
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,583

hold on to it.

of this nonsense, 17!

00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,666
[VEGETA] Well, well...

349
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,375
What have we here that
has you all so nervous?

350
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,000
A boy with long hair and
a scarf around his neck,

351
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,291
and a beautiful young girl.

352
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,041
I take it these are
the scary androids

353
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,708
we've heard so much about?

354
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,500
That's them.

355
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:42,666
[NARRATOR] Our heroes have
finally come face-to-face

356
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,083
with the Androids of
Trunks' predictions!

357
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,958
But can they really
be as terrible

358
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,791
as the young Saiyan claims?

359
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:54,125
Find out on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
