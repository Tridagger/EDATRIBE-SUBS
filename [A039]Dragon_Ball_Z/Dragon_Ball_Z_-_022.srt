00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,875
Evil rained down upon
an unsuspecting Earth!

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,625
And the quiet of
a peaceful morning

4
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,375
in the city
was shattered,

5
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:25,666
as two Saiyan space
pods came crashing

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,291
to the
planet's surface!

7
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:31,291
After a year-long
journey through space,

8
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:34,541
the dreaded Saiyan warriors
have finally arrived!

9
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,500
And the Earth's
greatest defenders

10
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,666
are ready to
meet them...

11
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,166
Goku's friends have
already used the power

12
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,458
of the Dragon Balls to restore
the fallen hero back to life.

13
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,375
And with his super-charged
strength and speed,

14
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,583
he has launched into the
two-day trip down Snake Way!

15
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,000
Every second counts.

16
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,666
Over a day still remains
in Goku's journey.

17
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,458
But the Saiyans
attack... Today!

18
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,958
Alien!

19
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:07,791
[WOMAN gasps]

20
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,625
Oh, my...
Incredible...

21
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,708
[MAN 2]
He's getting out!

22
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,250
[NAPPA] So what should we do
with these gawking fools!

23
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,500
They bother me!

24
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,333
[MAN (BLUE SUIT)]
Wh-Who are they?

25
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,041
[MAN (BASEBALL CAP)]
What are they?!

26
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,375
Oh, I don't know.

27
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,666
Why don't you decide for once?

28
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,791
Heh! Really? Thanks, Vegeta.

29
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,500
This is going to be
a lot of fun for me.

30
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,750
[VEGETA chuckles]

31
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,708
Don't mention it.

32
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,125
[NAPPA]
Heh, heh, heh...

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,750
[CROWD screams]

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:04:02,375
[NAPPA laughs]

35
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,125
[CHIAOTZU yells]

36
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,416
[TIEN]
Try to hold on!

37
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,458
What are they...
What are they doing?!

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,625
This is intense!

39
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,750
[NAPPA laughs]

40
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,875
Do you think I was trying too
hard to impress them, Vegeta?

41
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,333
There isn't anyone
left to impress, Nappa.

42
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,625
I should have known better
than to let you have any fun.

43
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,833
But why?

44
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,166
Hey, c'mon! A little
destruction won't effect

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,041
the sale price of this planet.
What's the big deal?

46
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,500
Try to use
your brain...

47
00:04:57,583 --> 00:05:00,416
We came here for the Dragon
Balls, remember, for the wish.

48
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,166
You remember the wish,
don't you, Nappa?

49
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,791
[NAPPA] Well, yeah,
we were going to wish for

50
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,166
immortality, weren't we?

51
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,583
Good, and we need all
seven balls, right?

52
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,916
So let me ask you...

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,625
What if one of the
balls happened to be in

54
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,333
the city you
just destroyed?

55
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:23,125
I'm sorry. I guess I just
forgot about that, huh?

56
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:24,833
[VEGETA] Well, let's
both forget about it.

57
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,916
What's done
cannot be undone.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,583
Now, first we
need to find out

59
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,791
who has the highest
power level.

60
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,000
He'll be the one who
finished off Raditz.

61
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:40,625
[NAPPA] Huh? More than
half-a-dozen people

62
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:45,916
on this planet have power
levels over a thousand!

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,666
How is that possible?

64
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,208
How should I know?

65
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:52,500
Maybe they've been preparing
for us... Not to worry.

66
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,333
Let's start out by finding
the strongest one.

67
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,833
[NAPPA] Hm.

68
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,791
[NAPPA] I just found
two of them.

69
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,875
They definitely have the
highest fighting power

70
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,333
on the planet.

71
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:09,791
Really? Good then. This may
be interesting after all.

72
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,875
[caws]

73
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,250
[ANNOUNCER] To repeat...

74
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,416
An unknown force of
devastating power

75
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,250
has completely destroyed
all of East City.

76
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,125
Government officials have
ruled out the possibility

77
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,291
of foreign
acts of war.

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,666
There were no
earthquakes in the area,

79
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,166
but noted physicists
have said

80
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,750
that the bright white light
that surrounded the city

81
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,291
could have been caused by
a multi-dimensional shift.

82
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:40,458
Well, the day has
finally arrived.

83
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,083
C'mon, let's go
help the others.

84
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,291
I can tell you
where they are!

85
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,041
What? Are you crazy?
What are we going to do?

86
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,333
[BULMA] Oolong!
You're such a coward!

87
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,041
Yeah! We're
going to help!

88
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:54,166
You just tell us what to do,
Master Roshi, and we'll do it!

89
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,250
Sorry, gang.
Oolong's right.

90
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,041
--[OOLONG] Huh?
--[BULMA] What?!

91
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,875
I'm afraid
it's true.

92
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:02,333
This sort of battle is just
way out of our league.

93
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,208
We'd only get in the
way of the others'

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,208
if we were there
with them.

95
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,333
Yeah, I guess so.

96
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,500
[OOLONG]
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

97
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,583
Oh my goodness!

[thinking] Hold on everybody!
I'm coming as fast as I can!

do it! Hold on!

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,541
Heh! Amazing! This
planet's weak gravity

103
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,375
makes me feel like a kid
again. I'm invincible!

104
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,541
It's time!
Man are they movin'!

105
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,333
All right! Well, at that speed
it won't take them very long

106
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,416
to get to Piccolo
and Gohan!

107
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,041
Goku, you better
hurry up and get back!

108
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,125
You know how much I hate
fighting without you.

109
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,208

headed straight for us!

110
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,500
Right!

you just stay here?

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,791
No way! I'm coming! I didn't
train so hard for nothing!

113
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,375
Besides, I'm
sticking with you!

115
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,750
I can't believe it!
There's nothing left!

All right! Let's move it!

[CAMERA MAN 2]
Say something, Ed!

118
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,708
[CREW MAN 1] It's reading a
little hot. It's safe though.

119
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,708
As you can see,
East City is gone.

120
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,916
Only a crater remains where
the great city once stood.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,083
How and why the city
vanished earlier today

122
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:51,750
remains a mystery...

I'm afraid not.

00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,666
At this point, we're
completely baffled.

126
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,791
[YAJIROBE] Yeah, well
I know what happened!

Oh, man! I was right!
The Saiyans are here!

And I'm supposed
to help fight 'em.

132
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:18,458
Maybe I can just go back to bed
and pretend I didn't see this.

all of this, didn't you?

For the last time!
It wasn't me, you dope!

It was

[INSPECTOR DOG]
H-How do you know?

175
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,291
[YAJIROBE]
Just come look.

176
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,708
Men! Search over here!

00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,000
[CREW MEN]
Yes, Sir!

178
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,291
[INSPECTOR DOG] Check out
those round things!

179
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,583
[CREW MEN] Right!

180
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:58,375
Hey, listen pal! Can we talk
for a moment here, privately?

181
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,750
I'd like to run your
story, if you'll tell it.

182
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:05,458
Sure, but we super-heroes
have to eat you know.

183
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:07,958
Oh... Well, how about
I take you to lunch?

184
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,750
[CREW MAN 1]
Excuse me, Inspector!

185
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,083
I don't know what this stuff is,

186
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,125
but I've never seen anything
like it before, sir!

187
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,041
[INSPECTOR DOG]
Huh? You're kidding!

188
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,916
Five thousand!
For an exclusive!

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
How's that for lunch?

190
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,500
Now, can you tell me why these
space men came down to Earth?

191
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,166
[REPORTER 2]
Hey, buddy, not so fast!

192
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,833
We want to hear
the story too.

193
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,708
We've got money
and plenty of it!

194
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:28,958
So do we!

195
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,125
[REPORTER 5] We'll give
you whatever you want.

196
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,000
[REPORTER 6]
Us, too!

197
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,375
Let's hear it!

198
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,625
Easy, there, Inspector,
first things first!

199
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,250
My stomach's growling!

200
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,583
Huh?

201
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,625
Money I don't really
need, but hot dogs...

202
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,041
[REPORTERS chatter]

203
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,625
Uh, heh, heh.
Here, it's not much!

204
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,500
But with that badge
you get free doughnuts!

205
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,416
Hmm...

206
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,000
I've got it!
They went that way!

207
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,375
[REPORTERS] Huh?!

208
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,500
I mean that way!

209
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,708
Let's see...
They're definitely there.

210
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,875
About three thousand
miles in that direction.

211
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:35,416
See you there.

212
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,791
You bet!

213
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,958
Heh, heh. Hey! If you're
smart you'd take my advice.

214
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,208
Don't go anywhere
near those Saiyans.

215
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,833
Those two will be
a living nightmare.

216
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,875
I say last one there
is a rotten egg!

217
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,958
Eat my dust!

00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,083
[whistle blows]

00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:52,708
[INSPECTOR DOG]
Let's go, men!

220
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,958
We've got to go
find those aliens!

221
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,125
Hm! Losers!
Oh, well, Ha...

222
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:03,291
I've got better things to
do now, like chow-down!

223
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,041
Though, maybe I should
blow off dinner

224
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:09,041
and go help them fight
the Saiyans... Na!

225
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:19,166

00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,541
They're on their way here!
Gohan, do not be afraid!

229
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,208
Your preparation
has been excellent!

230
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,458
Have faith
in yourself.

231
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,666
I'm ready.

232
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,541
What is this?
There's someone else coming!

233
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:54,166
It looks like there might be
one more than we expected!

234
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,500
But I thought you said
there were only

235
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,875
supposed
to be two Saiyans!

236
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,958
[PICCOLO] H-Huh?

237
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,000
It's Krillin!

238
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:03,500
Right! How 'bout
some help? Heh, heh.

239
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,333
Yeah, sure,
why not!

240
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:06,750
[PICCOLO laughs]

241
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,416
But things are going
to get intense!

242
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,083
You might just slow
us down, Krillin!

243
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,666
I doubt that! I've been doing
a little training of my own!

244
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,958
So you have.

245
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:21,500
I can feel a significant
increase in your power level.

246
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,416
Man! Goku's
running late.

247
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,458
We'll have to hold out
without him, somehow.

248
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,916
He's coming? I mean you really
know that for sure, Krillin?

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,666
Huh? Of course he is!

250
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,916
Master Roshi just talked
to him the other day!

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,458
Don't worry, Gohan.
He'll be here, alright.

252
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,708
Wow! That's great.
Thanks Krillin.

253
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,666
Hey, you grew up with
my Dad, didn't you?

254
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,500
He said guys thought
you couldn't fight

255
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,750
because you
were so short.

256
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,500
Short, huh? Actually,
we were the same size.

257
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,833
But then he kept
growing and I stopped.

258
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,458
By the way.
Are you all right?

259
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,916
No one's ever trained
with Piccolo before.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,125
Aw! It wasn't
that bad!

261
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,958
Once you get used
to him, he's great!

262
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,333
Hey! That's enough of your
small talk! They're here!

263
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:04,125
Huh?!

264
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,250
[NAPPA chuckles]

265
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,000
[NAPPA]
So, one more joined them!

266
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,541
What do you suppose
these three are doing

267
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,333
out in the
middle of nowhere?

268
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,458
I think they were waiting
for us. Yes, I'm sure of it.

269
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,958
Whoa... This is it.
It's really happening.

270
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,458
So these are the Saiyans.

271
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,541
Can you feel
those power levels?

272
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,500
[KRILLIN] They're even
stronger than I imagined!

273
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,041
What're we
gonna do, guys?

274
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,583
[VEGETA laughs]

275
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,833
So, we meet
at last!

276
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,375
[NAPPA chuckles]

277
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,708
The pleasure's mine.

278
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,791
[PICCOLO] I'm only
going to say this once.

279
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,416
Leave this planet.

280
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
This is your first
and last chance

281
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,208
to get out of
this alive.

282
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,708
[VEGETA]
That voice!

283
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,708
I see. You're the one who
defeated Raditz one year ago.

284
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,708
My voice?

285
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,916
Right. Didn't
Raditz tell you?

286
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,833
Our scouters also work
as communicators.

287
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,875
[NAPPA] Huh?

288
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,250
The green one's from
Namek, isn't he?

289
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,875
[VEGETA] Yes. He's
from Namek all right.

290
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,125
No wonder Raditz had such a
hard time with him and Kakarot.

291
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,083
I'm from Namek!

292
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:44,625
Eh? Piccolo! I didn't know
you were from outer space!

293
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,625
Of course...
It makes sense.

294
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,083
Is-Is that true,
Piccolo?

295
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,958
[grunts]

296
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,125
You didn't know?
Well, what a surprise.

297
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,666
Surely you must have suspected
something before now!

298
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,125
The green skin
and pointy ears

299
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,291
are a dead give away,
don't you think?

300
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:04,000
[PICCOLO thinking]
So, I'm from the planet Namek!

301
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:10,666
I can't believe it, but at the
same time, I know it's true!

302
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,583
Yes! It's true!

303
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,833
It was you who told Raditz
about the Dragon Balls!

304
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,916
Now tell us!
Where are they?

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,500
But, no one knows
where they are!

306
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,916
Not for a whole year!

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,583
That's enough. We know
the balls are down here!

308
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:26,916
Make no mistake!

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,625
We will find them with you
alive or with you dead!

310
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,958
It's your decision!

311
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,416
Tell us where they are
or you will all be killed!

312
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,916
Heh! I want to
thank you...

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,916
Because of you, I now know that
I come from the planet Namek.

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,125
But, this is
my planet now!

315
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,375
And no one is going to tell
me what to do with it!

316
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,833
So, back off! We're not here
to bow down to your demands!

317
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:54,500
We're here to fight!

318
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,833
So go ahead and do whatever
it is you came here to do!

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Are you okay?

320
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,666
Yes... I'm fine,
Mr. Popo.

321
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,625
For the first time in my life
I have heard about my origin.

322
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:15,375
Now I know the reason why I
have always had special powers.

323
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,666
You see, they just
said I'm from space...

324
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,500
A place
called Namek.

325
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,208
It all makes sense.

326
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:27,625
When I created the Dragon Balls
I fulfilled a deep yearning.

327
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:31,041
The blueprints for the balls
existed in my mind and heart

328
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,416
long before I was
able to give them form.

329
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,666
When I finally succeeded, I
felt as if I had made it home.

330
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,791
Or rather, as if
a piece of home,

331
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,708
had found its
way to me.

332
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,666
[helicopter blades whir]

333
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,958
Huh?

334
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,666
[NAPPA yells]

335
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,041
[CAMERA MAN]
Let's get out of here!

336
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,708
[VEGETA] I guess they're
not going to tell us

337
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,333
where the Dragon
Balls are, Nappa.

338
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,041
[NAPPA]
You wanna bet?

339
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:23,166
Alright! Let's see how
strong you really are!

340
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,958
[beeping]

341
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,750
[NAPPA] The kid's
at a thousand.

342
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,791
The Namek is at
fourteen hundred,

343
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,833
and the midget's
at eleven hundred.

344
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,333
You fools! Do you really
think you can beat us

345
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,375
with such puny
power levels?

346
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,500
Hey, Nappa...

347
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,208
Take your
Scouter off.

348
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,458
[NAPPA] What?

349
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,458
It seems they know how
to concentrate energy

350
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,291
and raise their
fighting powers.

351
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,416
These figures
are most unreliable.

352
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,583
Hey, right, good call!
Now I remember.

353
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,875
That pathetic loser, Raditz, 
let himself be fooled

354
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,625
by all of their
power readings.

355
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,625
You two be
ready for them!

356
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,083
Wait, Piccolo, if they're
stronger than Raditz,

357
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,416
and Goku isn't here,

358
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,208
how can you expect to
defeat them with just us?

359
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,750
[grunts]

360
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,500
Oh, well, guys...
Let's just do it.

361
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:18,583
Nappa, I believe it's time
we have a little fun with them.

362
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,500
Better yet, get
those Saibamen out.

363
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,166
There should be six of
them left... They'll do.

364
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,708
You're too much! You really
know how to have fun!

365
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,125
Huh? Saibamen?

366
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,041
I don't see
any men.

367
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,875
You're right,
there are six.

368
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,041
Maybe the Saibamen
can persuade them

369
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,791
to tell us where the Dragon
Balls are, huh, Nappa?

370
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,333
[NAPPA laughs]

371
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:45,125
Oh, I think they
can arrange that.

372
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,500
Uh, okay, what
are they doing?

373
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,416
[PICCOLO] I think we're
about to find out.

374
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,666
There.

375
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,833
Ah!

376
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,333
[VEGETA laughs]

377
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,750
[NAPPA chuckles]

378
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:21,291
Well, at least...
they're shorter than I am!

379
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:29,458
[SAIBAMEN growl]

380
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,916
[snarling]

381
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,416
[snarling]

382
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,458
[snarling]

383
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,666
They're brainless,
crazy monsters!

384
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,666
They're strong, too.

385
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,375
This should be a
pretty good match up.

386
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:21,041
These Saibamen
seem spunky.

387
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,458
[KRILLIN] I'll take
the two on the left!

388
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,541
[PICCOLO] I've got
the two in the middle.

389
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,208
The two on the
right are yours, Gohan!

390
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,208
[GOHAN] Okay!

391
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,916
[NARRATOR] Will these
sprouted Saiyan spawn

392
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
prove to be more than
our heroes can handle?

393
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,791
Or will they somehow
be able to withstand

394
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:44,833
the onslaught long enough
for Goku to return?

395
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:48,000
With the fate of the entire
world in the balance,

396
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,958
Goku's help can't
come fast enough...

397
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:55,000
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
