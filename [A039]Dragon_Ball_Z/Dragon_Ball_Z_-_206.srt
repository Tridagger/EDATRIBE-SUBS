1
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,583
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,416
[GOKU]
Gohan!

3
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,791
[GOHAN]
Dad! Unbelievable!

4
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,125
Hi, Son! It's great
to hear your voice!

5
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,125
This is great! Father!
Are you really coming back?!

6
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,500
[NARRATOR]
That's right, Gohan!

7
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,083
Goku is allowed to
come back for a day!

8
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,208
And he's going to use
his leave to compete

9
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,083
in the World
Martial Arts Championship!

10
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,916
[KRILLIN] What?! No way!
Goku's gonna compete!

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,750
I don't believe it!
This is amazing! Wow!

12
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,250
Goku! Well, whatd'ya know...

13
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,500
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
it didn't seem likely

14
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,000
that Krillin could escape
from his family duties

15
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,375
to fight in the tournament.

16
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,958
But when the prize money
was mentioned,

17
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,958
Eighteen decided
that participating

18
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:52,125
in the World Championships
would be a family affair!

19
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,291
High above the Earth,

20
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,041
Gohan extended
another invitation

21
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,583
to a well known warrior.

22
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:00,291
Goku! If he's entering,
it should be one to remember!

23
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,708
[GOHAN]
So, whatd'ya say?!

24
00:03:01,791 --> 00:03:03,125
[PICCOLO]
Sure! I'll do it!

25
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,541
[POPO] I'll bet Dende would
enjoy the tournament!

26
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,583
Hey, thanks!

27
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,250
But, I'm not much of a fighter!

28
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:10,375
[NARRATOR]
Lastly, Gohan broke the news

29
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,041
of Goku's return to
a certain small family

30
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,791
residing in the country!

31
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:18,750
Good news, son! You get
to meet your Daddy!

32
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,083
Isn't that wonderful?! Ohhh!

33
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,416
[NARRATOR] And so, Gohan,
choosing his younger brother,

34
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,208
Goten, as his training partner,

35
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,708
began his training
for the Tournament!

36
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,625
Alright! Nice warm-up!
Now! Let's get started!

37
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:36,791
[GOHAN] This is a little
trick Dad taught me!

38
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,541
Pretty cool, wouldn't you say?

39
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,416
Yeah!

40
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,916
[DENDE]
Amazing!

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,083
He's been in that state
for over 24 hours now!

42
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:12,583
[POPO] 27 hours, 9 minutes,
and 42 seconds to be exact!

43
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,250
[DENDE]
Wow!

44
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,250
[POPO]
Oh, no! Don't do it!

45
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,666
Oh, dear! Too late!
That makes 14 butterflies!

46
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,458
[DENDE]
Don't worry, Mr. Popo.

47
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,791
That's only one butterfly
every two hours!

48
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,250
Besides, I think this might
actually take care of

49
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,375
our mosquito problem
once and for all!

50
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,666
And watch-- I think I can help!

51
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,458
[POPO]
What do you mean, Dende?

52
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,750
[DENDE]
I don't think it's too late

53
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,208
for those last two casualties!

54
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Just a little touch
should do it!

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,916
[POPO]
Oh, my goodness! You saved them!

56
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,458
Honey! Wait! Not yet!

57
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,250
What about my coffee!
What about my breakfast!

58
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,250
This isn't fair!

59
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,291
[EIGHTEEN] You're gonna
have to earn your breakfast!

60
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,791
[KRILLIN] I think you're
getting carried away!

61
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,458
Ahhh!

62
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:13,208
[ROSHI] Wow! Heh. Doesn't
she have him on his toes!

63
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,041
Heh!

64
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,208
[KRILLIN, EIGHTEEN grunting]

65
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:20,333
[MARON yawns]

66
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,583
[GOHAN]
Ahhhh! Now, that was good!

67
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,208
Well! Whatd'ya say,
sport? Shall we?

68
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,416
You bet!

69
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,666
[GOHAN] Thanks, Mom!
It was great! See ya!

70
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,625
[GOTEN]
Bye-bye, Mom!

71
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:32,958
Goten!

72
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,416
I don't want you to get
in your big brother's way

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,458
while he's training, understand?

74
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,625
[GOTEN]
Huh?

75
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,208
[CHICHI] This tournament
is very important!

76
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,250
We're expecting Gohan
to do really well

77
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,708
so he can win the prize money

78
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,833
and we can have
money to live on!

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,666
I want you to promise
not to interfere

80
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,666
with his training!

81
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,541
I promise, Mom!
I won't interfere!

82
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,666
You'd better not! I know you!

83
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,708
[GOHAN]
C'mon, Goten! Let's go!

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,291
We don't have all day, you know!

85
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,166
[GOTEN]
Gotta go, Mom! See ya!

86
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,750
Behave yourself! Bye!

87
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,250
[GOTEN laughs]

88
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,750
[GOHAN grunts]

89
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,125
[GOTEN]
Ha, haaa!

90
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,708
[GOHAN]
Huh?

91
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,625
Goten! Where'd you go?

92
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,916
[GOHAN] I guess I went
too fast for the little guy!

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,291
[GOTEN laughing]

94
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:34,625
[GOHAN]
Hm? Hey, Goten! Where are you?

95
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:35,916
Over here!

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,625
I'm being attacked
by a wild dinosaur!

97
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,166
Please, help me!

98
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,750
Gohan, come over here
and meet my new friend!

99
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:47,083
He reminds me of Icarus! Hey!

100
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:52,250
[GOTEN laughing] Gohan!
Help me! It tickles! Please!

101
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,250
[GOHAN thinking]
Goten! So simple and happy!

102
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,166
Mom says that Dad was
like that when he was a boy!

103
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,375
Crazy little kid!

104
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,833
Hey! Goten!
I'm gonna get started!

105
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,083
I'll see you in a little bit!

106
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,458
What?! What's the matter
with you, Baba?!

107
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,291
Arranging such a thing
without my permission!

108
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,416
Are you crazy?

109
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,041
Look! Why not? Goku deserves it!

110
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,083
Don't be an old fuddy-duddy!

111
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,250
[GRAND KAI] How dare you,
you old dirty bag!

112
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:29,000
[KING KAI]
Now, now! Easy there, you two!

113
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,916
[KING KAI]
Look at how determined

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,416
and focused he is now!

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,916
Do you really have
the heart to tell him

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,708
that he can't go
back home and compete?!

117
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,250
Besides, Grand Kai!

118
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,333
You're the one he really
wants to train under!

119
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,416
If you want him to stay,
give him a lesson!

120
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,583
He's right! Goku's bored!

121
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,041
He needs a challenge.
Why don't you train him?!

122
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:54,416
What?! Uh, Goku? Train?

123
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,541
I-In his current condition,
I'm not sure his, uh, body

124
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,875
could withstand the
art of Grand Kai!

125
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:04,291
[GRAND KAI coughs]
Yes, perhaps this tournament

126
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,791
isn't such a bad idea after all,
if you know what I mean.

127
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,250
[BABA]
Hm!

128
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,958
Nyaaa!

129
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,458
[GOHAN yells]

130
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,333
[GOTEN]
Gohan!

131
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,375
Take a look at this!

132
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,333
[GOHAN] I hope it's
something important!

133
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,375
It is! Looky!

134
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:46,875
Oh... Wow, yeah...

135
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,291
[GOTEN] Gohan! Look at
the size of this guy!

136
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,208
He's huge! Ha, ha!

137
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,625
Hey! We didn't come
here to play, Squirt!

138
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,041
We came here to train!
Understand?!

139
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,958
[GOHAN] Now let's put our
noses to the grindstone

140
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,333
for a little while and get
some serious work done!

141
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay?!

142
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,125
[GOTEN]
Aw...

143
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,375
[GOHAN]
Look!

144
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,541
I'm not trying to hurt
your feelings, Goten!

145
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,958
It's just that I
have work to do!

146
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,833
[GOHAN]
Mm! Hyaa!

147
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,666
[GOHAN]
Hyaaa!

148
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:42,750
[GOHAN yells]

149
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,041
[GOTEN]
Gohan!

150
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,083
What?! What now, Goten?! Aah!

151
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,541
[GOTEN]
I've got him, Gohan!

152
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:53,291
I've got the big one! Whoa!
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Woo!

153
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,875
[GOHAN]
Goten! Get down from there!

154
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,416
That's very dangerous!

155
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,041
[GOTEN laughs]

156
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,208
[GOHAN]
Aah! Goten! Haaaa!

157
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,666
Hey, are you okay?

158
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,083
[GOTEN] I just have
a bump on my head!

159
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,750
Don't you know you
coud've been killed?!

160
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,875
Are you crazy?!

161
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,708
Do you know how mad
Mom would've been

162
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,250
if I went home for dinner
and told her you were dead?!

163
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:27,125
Yes! Sorry! Gosh!

164
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:38,000
[GOHAN grunting]

165
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,791
Whew! Hm?

166
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,291
[GOHAN]
Goten!

167
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,083
Huh?!

168
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,250
I need your help, bro!

169
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,875
Can you assist me
in an exercise?

170
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,083
Yeah!

171
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,666
[GOHAN]
There! That oughta be enough!

172
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,000
Enough for what?

173
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,000
When are you gonna tell me
what we're doing?! Huh?!

174
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,916
[GOHAN] It's simple!
It's like playing a game!

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,583
You throw the rocks
and I dodge 'em?

176
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,833
'Kay?

177
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,416
[GOTEN] You want me to
hit you with the rocks?

178
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,291
[GOHAN] If you can!
But, you can't cross this line!

179
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,625
This is a great drill!

180
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,791
It sharpens intuitive reaction!

181
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,000
It teaches you how to act when
you don't have time to think!

182
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,333
[GOTEN]
Mm-hm! I get it now!

183
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:30,083
Alright, Goten!
Good! Let 'em fly!

184
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,208
[GOTEN]
Don't you think the line

185
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,458
should be a little
farther back, Gohan?

186
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,083
Nah! Don't worry about me!
I'll be just fine!

187
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,166
If anything, it's a
little too far back!

188
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,333
You must be fast! Wowee!

189
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,750
Well! We'll see!

190
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:47,208
Hopefully big brother
hasn't gotten too rusty!

191
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,041
[GOTEN]
Hmm... 'Kay!

192
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,958
I'm gonna throw
as hard as I can!

193
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,125
Great! Go!

194
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,458
[GOTEN]
Alright! Here it comes!

195
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,541
[GOHAN gasps]

196
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,375
Wow! I can't believe it!
You are fast!

197
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,250
[GOHAN gasps]

198
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,666
[GOTEN]
Wow! This is fun, Gohan!

199
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,500
Let's do it some more!

200
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,000
[GOHAN]
No, no, no! Whoa!

201
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,500
Wait a second, Goten!

202
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,916
I think we are going to move
the line back a little bit!

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,375
There! That oughta do it!

204
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,625
Man, sport! That's a heck
of an arm you've got there!

205
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,250
Let's give it a try
from back here now!

206
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,791
[GOTEN]
Okay! Whatever you say! Haa!

207
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,333
[GOHAN grunting]

208
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,416
[GOTEN laughing]

209
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,250
[GOHAN grunting]

210
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,875
[GOHAN grunting]

211
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,416
[GOHAN]
I'm getting used to it, Goten!

212
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,958
Keep 'em coming!
You can move in closer now!

213
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,125
[GOTEN]
Hm?

214
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:47,208
Uhh! Hey, why'd you stop, bro?

215
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,833
Well, since Mom's
not here is it okay

216
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,416
if I be like you now?

217
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,791
[GOHAN]
Hmm! Well...

218
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,333
What do you mean, like me?

219
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,458
[GOTEN] Well, you know!
The golden hair!

220
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,833
And the super strength!

221
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,833
I wanna be a Super Saiyan now!

222
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:05,750
[GOHAN laughs] Maybe when
you're a little older!

223
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,666
It takes years of training
to become a Super Saiyan!

224
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,083
I was twice your age
before I was strong enough

225
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,875
for Dad to teach me
how to transform!

226
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,416
Of course, I was the youngest
Super Saiyan ever!

227
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,750
You might need
more time! Huh?!

228
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,125
[GOHAN gasps]

229
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:31,250
[GOHAN] Goten! You're a...
You're a Super Saiyan!

230
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,250
Oh, my gosh!
This is unbelievable!

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,250
[GOHAN]
Incredible! Whoa! Man!

232
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,291
When in the world did
this happen, Goten?!

233
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,541
This change-- s-since when?!

234
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:10,125
[GOTEN]
Mmm... I don't remember!

235
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,458
[GOHAN]
Ahh?! This is crazy!

236
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,958
You're such a natural,
Goten! My goodness!

237
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,541
Dad and I had to struggle really
hard to become Super Saiyans!

238
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,208
And Vegeta!
What a case he was!

239
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:24,291
So, How'd you like to be
my sparring partner, Goten?

240
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:25,375
Does that sound okay?

241
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,583
Yeah!

242
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you know
sparring form, Goten?

243
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,166
Yeah, of course!

244
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,750
That's the one that
Mom always taught me

245
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,541
while you were studying!
I love that one!

246
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,375
Our Mom trained you?

247
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,625
Uh-huh! Everyday! While you
were doing homework!

248
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,166
[GOHAN]
Hmm?

249
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,666
[GOHAN thinking] Mom sure has
changed since the old days!

250
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,625
Even her letting me
out of school to train

251
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,083
for the tournament
is a huge difference!

252
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,500
I think that Dad dying must've
had a lot to do with it!

253
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:56,625
Hey, sport. Does, uh,
does Mom know about this?!

254
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,458
You know! About being able
to become a Super Saiyan?!

255
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:01,041
[GOTEN]
Mm-hm!

256
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,166
[GOTEN thinking]
Oh, yeah! She knows, alright!

257
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,750
[CHICHI grunting]

258
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,000
[CHICHI]
Come on, Goten! Counter!

259
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,916
Hey, you! Stop running
away and fight!

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,208
Hyaa!

261
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,333
Come on! Hyaaa! Huh?!

262
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,875
[CHICHI gasps]

263
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,875
[GOTEN yells]

264
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,625
[CHICHI yells]
[GOTEN] Huh?

265
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,791
[GOTEN]
Gosh, Mom! Are you okay?!

266
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,666
[CHICHI]
Huh?! You're a Su...

267
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,875
...per Saiyan!

268
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,000
[GOTEN]
I am? Is that bad?

269
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:44,875
Uuugh! Not another
monster in the family!

270
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,250
[GOHAN]
What's the matter, Goten?

271
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,583
Did Mom give you a hard time
when you transformed?!

272
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,375
Yeah! She said never
do it again!

273
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,666
I guess it's a bad thing because
she called me a monster!

274
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,208
[GOHAN laughs]
Don't worry about it too much!

275
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,958
You're the best
little monster I know!

276
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,875
[GOHAN] Alright, Goten!
Are you ready?!

277
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,666
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

278
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,000
[GOHAN]
Let's do it!

279
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:29,458
[GOHAN, GOTEN grunting]

280
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,333
Take this!

281
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,250
[GOTEN]
Huh?

282
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,458
Hey! That's not fair, Gohan!

283
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,833
[GOHAN]
Hm?

284
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,250
[GOTEN]
You're cheating!

285
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,000
You have to stay on the
ground because I can't fly!

286
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,291
What?! Are you kidding me?!

287
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,916
No! If I could fly,
I'd be kicking your butt!

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,833
Uh?! That's incredible! Wow!

289
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,458
That's like learning how
to run before you can crawl!

290
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,375
You're more like
a super-pedestrian

291
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,666
than a Super Saiyan!

292
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,541
A super what?!

293
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,541
Hey! Sorry, Squirt!
It's just that it's funny!

294
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,458
Funny?! Well, you better
teach me how to fly,

295
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,333
because I don't like
being laughed at!

296
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:11,416
You hear me?!

297
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,541
[GOHAN]
Whoa! Whoa! Easy there, Tiger!

298
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,291
Cut me some slack!

299
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,416
Alright! I'll teach you
how to fly, Goten!

300
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,666
How's that?

301
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,458
Wow! You will?!

302
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,375
[GOHAN]
Yes!

303
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,291
[GOTEN]
Ha, ha! Alright!

304
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,083
I'm gonna fly! I'm gonna fly!

305
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:31,208
[GOHAN laughing]
Hm! Hm?

306
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,041
Wait... is that...

307
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,000
...Videl?

308
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,958
Yikes! I'd almost forgotten!
Flying lessons!

309
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:57,291
I promised her at school that
I'd teach her how to fly!

310
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,458
[GOTEN]
Gohan! What's the matter?!

311
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,666
[GOHAN]
Uhh, nothing!

312
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
But it looks like you're
gonna have a partner

313
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,208
for the flying lessons!

314
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,875
A partner? Who?

315
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,250
It's a long story!

316
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,250
There's a girl in
my class and I promised

317
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,583
that I would
teach her how to fly!

318
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,500
And, she's heading for
our house right now!

319
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,708
She's gonna be your parnter
in the leassons but,

320
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,583
don't show her how strong
you really are, okay?

321
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:20,041
Uh, look! What I mean is...

322
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,416
Don't show her that you're
a Super Saiyan! Got it?

323
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,625
Oh, I see!

324
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,416
She's scared of
little monsters, isn't she?!

325
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,791
[GOHAN]
Uhh... Mm... Yeah!

326
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,333
I guess you could
say that, Goten! Come on!

327
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,083
Let's boogie!

328
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,500
[GOTEN]
Right!

329
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,291
[GOTEN]
Hey! You're really fast, Gohan!

330
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,000
I can't believe that
I couldn't hit you

331
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,625
with one of those rocks!
That was incredible!

332
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,750
Well, you've got a
real talent yourself!

333
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,916
I can't believe that
you're this far along!

334
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,958
Maybe you could enter the
World Championships too

335
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,333
if you keep practicing!

336
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,666
[GOTEN]
Are you serious?!

337
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,958
Me, enter the Worlds
Martial Arts Championship?!

338
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:59,416
That would be the
most awesome, incredible,

339
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
totally cool thing that could
ever happen to a kid my age!

340
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,500
Wow!

341
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,000
You know, I play fight
games with Trunks

342
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,583
all the time and he's
even stronger than I am!

343
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,208
What? Is he really?
That's amazing!

344
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,166
I had no idea that you
guys were even playing

345
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,291
these training games!

346
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,791
Yeah! It's a lot of fun!

347
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,458
That's all we do when
Bulma brings him over!

348
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,833
[GOHAN thinking]
Holy cow!

349
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,916
These little guys are gonna
get stronger than I am

350
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,458
if I don't watch it!

351
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,000
[CHICHI] Missy, whatever
it is you're selling,

352
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,166
I don't want it.

353
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,791
[VIDEL] Hi there!
I was looking for Gohan!

354
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,041
Is he home?

355
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,333
[CHICHI] Well, if you've
come looking for a date,

356
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,416
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong place!

357
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,958
What manners you have!

358
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,208
Coming over unannounced and
without a proper introduction!

359
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,416
Shame on you!

360
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,291
Look, lady! I'm not
here for a date!

361
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,291
Sure! Huh?

362
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,958
[GOHAN]
Hi, Mom! We're back!

363
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,291
[VIDEL]
Hm?!

364
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,583
[GOTEN] Hey, Mom! I got
to throw rocks at Gohan!

365
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,458
[CHICHI]
You did?!

366
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,166
Well... Hi! Wow!

367
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,958
How'd you find
my address, Videl?!

368
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,500
Simple. I looked you up
in the Student Directory.

369
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,666
[GOHAN laughs]
Oh yeah...

370
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,958
Now! Listen up!

371
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,333
Thought you could
get out of our deal

372
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,000
by taking a leave of
absence from school?

373
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,791
Well, I've got news
for you, Gohan!

374
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,541
You're gonna teach
me how to fly!

375
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,875
That's fine!

376
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,875
I gave you my word and
that's all there is to it!

377
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,291
[CHICHI] Excuse me! My Gohan
can't give you lessons!

378
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:15,708
He's busy preparing himself
for the World Championships!

379
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,000
[GOHAN] Mom! Videl's actually
the one that talked me into

380
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,666
taking part in the
World Championships!

381
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,875
If it wasn't for her,

382
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,791
I would have never even
considered entering!

383
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,291
[VIDEL]
Hm!

384
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,250
[CHICHI] Hmm. Well,
alright then! Teach her!

385
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,958
But let me give you
some advice, young lady!

386
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,291
You keep your filthy
hands off my son!

387
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:36,166
[VIDEL growls]
Hey!

388
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,458
I've had enough of
your trashy talk, lady!

389
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,750
[CHICHI gasps]

390
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:40,833
Oh...

391
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,166
Guh...

392
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,458
[CHICHI] Alright! You listen
and you listen good!

393
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,458
Our family is counting
on the prize money

394
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,125
from this tournament to live on!

395
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,583
And the last thing we need
is for Gohan to be distracted

396
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,500
from his training
by a hussy like you!

397
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,666
Rrrrgh! I am not a hussy!

398
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,833
We're training for a Martial
Arts Tournament, not eloping!

399
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,083
The two don't mix!

400
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,500
My Mom and Dad got married

401
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,875
at the World Championships!
Didn't you, Mom?

402
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,750
Maybe that's why she's worried!

403
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:08,333
I guess kissy-kissy stuff
and fighting do mix sometimes,

404
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,541
don't they, Mom?!

405
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,625
In our case, yes! I competed!

406
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,625
I faught your Dad and married
him in the same day!

407
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,875
You faught in the Worlds...?

408
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,416
[CHICHI]
Ahhh! Those were the days!

409
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,291
Those were some of the
happiest times of my life!

410
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,250
Going head-to-head with
Goku in a vicious battle!

411
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,375
And then, riding off
with him, hand in hand,

412
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:34,000
in a swirl of romance that still
makes me tingle to this day!

413
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,333
It was the beginning of
our new life together!

414
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,416
Ah... Yes!

415
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,625
Sometimes true love
and fighting do mix!

416
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,125
But you! Your case is different!

417
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,333
Goku and I had been dating
since we were kids!

418
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,250
Look! I don't
wanna marry your son!

419
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,916
I wanna learn how
to fly! That's all!

420
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,291
Are you deaf or something?!

421
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,208
[CHICHI]
Rrrgh! How dare you!

422
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,875
[VIDEL growls]

423
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,708
[VIDEL growls]

424
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,250
[VIDEL growls]

425
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,708
[NARRATOR]
It's the Mother of all catfights

426
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,708
and this one could
go on until dawn!

427
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:12,458
But does Gohan have time to
waste with the commencement

428
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,666
of the World
Martial Arts Championship

429
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,750
just one month away?!

430
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, man!

431
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,500
Looks like those two are
really hitting it off!

432
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,500
[GOTEN laughs]

433
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,041
[GOHAN thinking] Goten really
does remind me of Dad!

434
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,583
So powerful and yet
so happy and carefree!

435
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,041
I wonder if he's gonna
be more powerful

436
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:32,375
than all of us someday?!

437
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:36,958
[GOHAN thinking] Just a child,
and he's already a Super Saiyan!

438
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,458
Man! Looks like
I've got work to do!

439
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,625
[NARRATOR]
As the battle between

440
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,458
Videl and Chichi continues,
the real battle approaches!

441
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,291
Will Goten be able to
enter the tournament?

442
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,708
And will Gohan have enough
time to get ready?!

443
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,958
Stay tuned for scenes from the
next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
