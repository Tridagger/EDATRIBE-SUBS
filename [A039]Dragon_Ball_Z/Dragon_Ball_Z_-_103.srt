00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,833
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,416
power levels were
shooting off the charts,

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,291
as Frieza and Goku exchanged
punches, kicks, and insults.

4
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,750
While thanks to some
clever wishing,

5
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,500
Bulma and the gang found
themselves safe and sound

6
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,166
on planet Earth.

7
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,541
But where is Goku?

8
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,666
He's still battling
it out with Frieza.

9
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,750
Wanting to put an end to the
evil tyrant once and for all,

10
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,000
Goku chose to remain on Namek.

11
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,541
A brave move indeed,

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,583
because the damaged planet
is set to explode any minute!

13
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,750
And it seems Frieza
has a plan of his own.

14
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,000
[FRIEZA] I don't know how
to break this to you,

15
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,458
but you only have about
one minute to live.

16
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,916
[NARRATOR] Can Super Saiyan
Goku finally defeat Frieza

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,375
and escape from
Namek in time?

18
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,500
Find out today!

19
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:55,208
[GOKU &amp; FRIEZA grunting]

20
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,416
What makes you think
you can do this to me?

21
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,333
You're nothing but
an overgrown monkey!

22
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,875
[GOKU growls]

23
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:29,250
[BOTH grunting]

24
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,666
[KING KAI] Goku! You
don't have time for this!

25
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,541
[TIEN] What is it, King Kai?
What's happening?

26
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,916
[KING KAi] On the surface,
it is an even battle.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,041
Goku is matching every
move that Frieza makes!

28
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,291
[KING KAI] But in one minute,
none of that will matter...

29
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,458
Huh?

30
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,583
And the battle
will end precisely

31
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,625
as Frieza has planned it.

32
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,041
What? What are you saying?

33
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:04,125
No one has ever truly
challenged Frieza before!

34
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,875
Until now, he has
gotten everything

35
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,583
he could wrap his
icy fingers around.

36
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,583
When it became clear that
Goku could not be defeated,

37
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,541
Frieza was stunned!

38
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,708
So he did something drastic!

39
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,041
Your power is amazing

40
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,625
but there's more to
winning than that!

41
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,750
Sometimes it's the smartest
one who wins, not the strongest!

42
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

43
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,375
Now, say goodbye to Namek!

44
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,583
[FRIEZA yells]

45
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,458
[GOKU gasps]

46
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,000
[KING KAI] Out of desperation,

47
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,125
Frieza shot an energy blast
down to Namek's core,

48
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,541
attempting to explode
the entire planet!

49
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,000
[GOKU yells]

50
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,125
[KING KAI] With Namek
reduced to space dust,

51
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,875
Goku and everyone else on the
planet would surely be doomed!

52
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:03,000
[BULMA screams]

53
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,125
[GOHAN screams]

54
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,791
Whoa! This is huge!

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,125
[KING KAI] Fortunately,
things didn't work out

56
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,250
like Frieza had planned.

57
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,916
Darn! I held back
too much power!

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,625
So you couldn't do it!

59
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:52,875
You just couldn't go
through with it after all!

60
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,041
You couldn't kill us both!

61
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,208
You still don't get it, do you?

62
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,958
[FRIEZA chuckles]

63
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,708
[FRIEZA] I didn't plan on
destroying myself,

64
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,916
just you and the planet!

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,791
I can breathe in space
and you can't!

66
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,958
That means if the planet goes...

67
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:11,291
then you won't have
anymore air to live on!

68
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,625
And I shall be victorious!

69
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,166
Five minutes!

70
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,000
[FRIEZA giggles]

71
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,541
[FRIEZA] Then the
planet explodes!

72
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,791
Most of the five
minutes have expired!

73
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,208
Unless Goku hurries,

74
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,375
he will have no choice but
to die with the planet!

75
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:37,583
But Frieza will survive!
He can live anywhere.

76
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,041

You see?

80
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,125
A Saiyan can't beat me!

81
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:02,041
A monkey can't beat me!
You can't! You can't! You can't!

82
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:03,833

95

Um, what are you doing
with those leaves?

[BULMA giggles]

97
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,125
I'm telling fortunes.

98
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,583
I used to do this
when I was a child.

99
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:27,333
[BULMA] When you want a traveler
to come home, you draw a circle,

100
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,583
you put three leaves in the
middle, and then you burn them.

101
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,875
If all three leaves burn up,

102
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,333
then the traveler will
return home safely!

103
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,666
So... this will tell
us if Goku's okay, right?

I'm sure they'll all burn up!

109
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,125
[DENDE] So Goku
will come back safe?

110

have never been wrong!

is nonsense!

make it home okay!

Frieza for good,

00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,333
[thinking] Maybe Goku
is wiser than I thought...

183
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,875
[FRIEZA] Don't just stand
there! Say something!

184
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,166
You said it's done.
What do you mean?

185
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,833
Your energy level is
decreasing with every blow.

186
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,041
In fact, you're not even a
challenge to me anymore.

187
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,666
It wouldn't be fair for me
to keep fighting you.

188
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,500
I'm satisfied now. Your pride
has been torn to shreds.

189
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,000
You've challenged and lost to a
fighter who is superior to you,

190
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,791
and to make it worse...

191
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,208
He's just a monkey, right?

192
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:21,125
[FRIEZA whimpers]

193
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,041
It would be meaningless
to fight you now,

194
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,875
you're too scared and ashamed.

195
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:29,666
Live with the shock! Keep it
bottled up inside you silently.

196
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:37,958
[FRIEZA growls]

197
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:41,750
[GOKU sighs]

198
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:45,625
[GOKU] Goodbye, Frieza.
Never do mischief again.

199
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,666
May you live the rest
of your life in peace.

200
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,416
[FRIEZA growls]

201
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,291
"Peace"?

202
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,250
[FRIEZA growls]

203
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,708
Nonsense!

204
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,416
[FRIEZA growls]

205
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,416
Never!

206
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,000
I will never... never be...

207
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,208
...defeated!

208
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,666
[FRIEZA yells]

209
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,833
[FRIEZA growls]

210
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,041
You truly are a helpless fool!

211
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:47,208
I gave you one last
chance to live!

212
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,958
[GOKU] And this
is how you repay me?!

213
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:59,166
[GOKU growls]

214
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,291
[GOKU yells]

215
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:36,750
[GOKU growls]

216
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,916
[FRIEZA giggles]

217
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:12,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

218
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,416
[FRIEZA] Round and round
the monkey goes!

219
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,708
If he should stop,
then off with his nose!

220
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,875
[FRIEZA laughs]

221
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:25,083
I just don't understand you,
Frieza. I tried to help you.

222
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,625
[GOKU grunts]

223
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

224
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,416
[FRIEZA] Huh...?

225
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,625
Huh! It seems the little
Saiyan has a strategy!

226
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,791
Fly at me and pull up
at the last second,

227
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,625
so the blade will
cut me instead!

228
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,750
You think I'm stupid enough to
fall for such a childish trick?!

229
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,791
Goku, you're wasting your time!

230
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,250
This is your last
chance to escape!

231
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,750
Huh?

232
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:34,541
Come home, Daddy!

233
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,666
[NARRATOR] Can Goku outsmart
the diabolical Frieza

234
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,958
and avoid this final attack?

235
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:51,958
Tune in for the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
