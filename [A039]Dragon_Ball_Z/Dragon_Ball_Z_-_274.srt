[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,416
no sooner had Vegito landed
in Majin Buu's stomach

3
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,291
than he was blown apart!

[NARRATOR]
And the search was on.

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,583
Goku and Vegeta were
looking for their sons

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,083
who, along with Piccolo,
had been absorbed

9
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:36,291
into the inner workings of Buu.

10
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,458
[NARRATOR] But this rescue
mission could only work

11
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:42,708
if the rescuers
managed to stay alive.

12
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,083
[NARRATOR] Into the deadly
gastric juices they plunged

13
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,125
until Vegeta created an ulcer

14
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,375
through which the duo
made a narrow escape!

15
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,208
[NARRATOR]
But one peril led to another

16
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,583
in this living house of horrors.

17
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,041
And the Saiyan
team was attacked

18
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,750

bite off more than
they can chew,

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,666
they summon the big boss who
comes to finish off the job.

Good! Let's go find
Kakarot. Follow me.

Huh?!

181
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,583
What is this?

182
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,958
[KIBITO KAI]
It's Gohan! And Gotenks!

183
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:41,000
Superb! They succeeded!
Yes! Now they can escape.

184
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,916
But why would the boys
do a Fusion technique

185
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,083
unless they were preparing
themselves for a big fight. Hmm?

186
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,083
[KIBITO KAI]
I see.

187
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,208
All right! Let's get out of
this place. Whatd'ya say, son?

188
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,916
Gohan! What's the big idea,
son? Why did you do that?!

Why? And how?!

198
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,833
Gohan's too pure to be taken
over by the forces of darkness!

199
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,208
Calm your mind and look!

200
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,833
Things are not
as they appear, Kai.

201
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:05,208
They're in an arena where
Buu's thoughts can take form.

202
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,541
Gohan and the others are
thought-forms created by Buu.

203
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,125
How do you beat a thought, Sir?

204

[OLD KAI]
Good question!

205
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,875
[GOKU] I can tell by
the look in your eyes

206
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
that you're not my son!

I'd better get a bite

219
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,666
No sense destroying the
world on an empty stomach.

220

Ha, ha, ha! Look at him go!

221

Stop wasting time.
Let's track him down.

Look! I don't want to fight him!

Well, that's good, because
no sane person would!

228

But we're gonna do it anyway!

T-T-T-Tell me-me h-how?

230
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,125
Well, he said that he was gonna
get something to eat, right?

231
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:29,250
Well, I'm sure he'll let his
guard down while he's eating.

232
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,791
Then, we got him!

Oh, boy!

234
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:38,916
Maybe I can do it!
Hiyaaa! Take that! Uhh...

Maybe... Maybe
I've lost my marbles!

Fighting Buu, well,
that would be suicide!
