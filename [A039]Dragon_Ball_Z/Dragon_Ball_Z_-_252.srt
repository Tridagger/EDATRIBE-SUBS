00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,000
Trunks and Goten completed
their fusion training!

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:21,791
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Fu... sion... Ha!

4
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,041
Yes! You're doing it!
Stay with it!

5
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:40,458
Whoa! It worked!

6
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,000
[NARRATOR] With their powers
successfully combined,

7
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,791
the fused warrior
Gotenks was born

8
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,333
and against better judgment,

9
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,375
he hastily set out to
do battle with Majin Buu.

10
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,500
[GOTENKS grunts]

11
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,000
[NARRATOR] Even with
all of Gotenks' strength,

12
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,916
the monster proved
much too resilient

13
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,916
for the young
fighter to handle.

14
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:03,250
[BUU screeches]

15
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,166
[NARRATOR] And he was forced
to return to his friends

16
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,375
at the Lookout...

17
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
[BULMA]
Did you beat Majin Buu?!

18
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,708
[NARRATOR]
...defeated.

19
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,791
[GOTENKS]
Not exactly...

20
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,791
He's a-a little
tougher than I thought!

21
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:17,208
[ALL groan]

22
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,375
[NARRATOR] Gotenks wasn't
the only one surprised

23
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,166
by Majin Buu's power.

24
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,208
The world's remaining
military forces

25
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,625
assembled in a desperate bid
to bring the monster down,

26
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,375
but to no avail.

27
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,375
Armed with their
mightiest weapons,

28
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:34,000
their efforts served only to
irritate the pudgy pink terror.

29
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,250
[GOTENKS] No! Run!
He's going to attack!

30
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:44,291

[NARRATOR]
With every passing hour,

32
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,291
humanity's hopes for survival

33
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,666
are growing
fainter and fainter.

34
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,791
Is there no one left
who can stand up

35
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,166
to the destructive
force of Majin Buu?

36

on Dragon Ball Z!

Whoo-hoo! Buu go bang, bang!

38
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,208
Buu!

00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,666

40
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,625

[BUU]
Save for later.

44
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,958
[NARRATOR] Majin Buu continued
his destructive spree,

45
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:02,000
devouring untold scores of the
world's unsuspecting citizens.

46
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,625
The few remaining military
forces made a bid

47
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:06,000
to stop the monster

48
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,375
but were unable to withstand
Buu's awesome power.

49
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:12,583
Now, those few that remain
have gone into hiding,

50
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:17,166
hoping against hope that
a new hero will emerge.

51
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,791
[RADIO ANNOUNCER] Keep in mind
that the information we have

52
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,166
is pieced together from various
pirate radio broadcasts

53
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,541
around the world.

54
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,666
The devastation
seems to be non-ending,

55
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,083
with at a rough count,

56
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,250
only one fifth of the world's
population remaining.

57
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,041
All of our major
cities are gone.

58
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791

mostly destroyed

59
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,416
with any and all workable armies
completely out of commission.

60
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,083
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is horrible.

61
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,458
However, we have heard
unsubstantiated rumors

62
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,916
that there may be someone left.

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,291
Someone left in this
world willing to fight.

64
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:44,833
I repeat, all
of this information

65
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:46,333
is unconfirmded at this time,

66
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,208

trickles down to us

to you immediately.

Interesting news here.

Hope for defeating
Majin Buu remains!

70
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,416
What we are beginning to
understand is that Mr. Satan

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,041
has been safely training
in his underground bunker,

72
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,000
protected by armed
guards at all times

73
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,708
from any type of outside threat.

Oh, this is amazing,

75
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:08,416
he is expected to
emerge sometime today!

this Buu clown for you.

Listen to them out there.

All they needed to give 'em
a little hope was a hero.

I can't stand that!
It's burning.

Stop it! You know exactly
what you did! Ten!

I'm sorry, but you're the only
thing I have left in this world.

The next time you want to go out
and do something so reckless,

00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,541
try and remember that, okay?

'Kay, Mom...

101

Uh, yeah...

103
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,250
[PICCOLO] You both should
listen to your mothers.

104
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,458
No fighter that has
ever won a victory

105
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,125
did so using his fists alone.

106
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
All battles are won before
they are even fought,

107
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,291
and do you know how?

108
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,000
By planning?

109
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,625
That's right.

110
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:34,541
So you're saying that my dad
just didn't plan enough.

111
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,041
Then I run off
and do the same thing!

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,500
That's the last time,
from now on I'm doing it right.

113
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,625
I have to be smart to win,

than my dad ever was!

to impossibility.

this bad boy lives, huh?

00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,083
Uh, yes, that's what we've
been told, Mr Satan.

Well, you guys can relax now.
The Champ is on the scene.

Uh, excuse me, sir,
but what's in the bag?

136
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,916
Oh, it's nothing really,
just some toys.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,250
Top secret toys
that'll make Majin Buu

138

Oh, top secret toys.
Can I take a look at them?

140
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,208
I have to save them for
when it counts, General.

141
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,375
I was told a long time ago

142
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,041
that the most
important key to victory

143
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,791
is the element of surprise.

144
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,708
And with what the surprises I've
got in store for this lowlife,

145

heard the name Mr. Satan!

Please excuse my intrusion

162
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,625

wrong with your voice.

noticed us yet.

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,333
[GENERAL]
Yes sir, anything to help, sir.

177
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,916
The whole world owes you an
incredible debt of gratitude!

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,083
[MR. SATAN] Yeah, yeah.
Now you just hang out over there

179
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,208
by the plane or something.

180
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,583
And I'll call you
if I need anything.

181
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,041
[gasps]

182
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,083
Cowards. Well, at least
they're out of the way.

183
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,125
I sure hope Buu didn't
hear 'em taking off.

184
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,250
[MR. SATAN]
Be a tree... Be the tree...

185
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,750
[grunts]

186
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,583
[MR. SATAN]
Is... anybody home?

187
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,583
He's gone.

188
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,333
[laughs]

189
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,541

190
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,291
[grunts]

191
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,750
[laughs]
It looks like I'm all alone!

192
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,250
So, Mr. Big Pink Fatso,

193
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:48,041
I guess you got scared
and ran off, didn't you?!

194
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,333
Can't say I blame ya,

195
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,000
I'd be scared of me, too!

196
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,166
[laughs]

197
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,583
Here! I got somethin'
for ya! Take that!

198
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:59,416
[laughs]

199
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
[grass rustles,
gasps]

200
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:05,166
Oh, please, Mr. Buu sir!
I am so sorry! Really!

201
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,208
I-It was a mistake!

202
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,958
I would never do
anything to offend you

203
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,541
or this lovely home you've made!

204
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:17,000
[LIZARD beeps]

205
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,583
Ahh! Stu-pid Li-zard!

206
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,750
Who's scary now, huh?!

207
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,708
Don't sneak up
on me like that, again!

208
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,083
[BUU]
Helloooo!

209
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,625
Hey, you!

210
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,833
[gasps]

211
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,625
Oh, finally!

212
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,791
Mr. Majin Buu,
it's so good to see you!

213
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,375
I've been wanting to meet you

214
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,458
since I heard the first reports
of your worldwide devastation!

215
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:10,375
So... Do you want to
be candy, cookie, or pudding

216
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,166
when Buu eats you?

217
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,041
Wait, wait, wait!

218
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,625
I didn't come here to get eaten!

219
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,291
I-I came to bring
you some presents!

220
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,750
The best chocolates
money can buy!

221
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,125
Buu like big chocolates.
Eat you instead.

222
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,958
But these are packed
with the same amount

223
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,375
of chocolate-y goodness,

224
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,083
they're just made smaller
so you can eat a lot more.

225
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:35,416
They look good.
You want to eat, too?

226
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,208
Uh, no thanks,
I'm allergic to chocolate,

227
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,083
I break out in hives all over.

228
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,583
[sniffs]

229
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,708
[whimpers]

230
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,375
[thinking]
He ate it! I can't believe it!

231
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,125
Each one of those chocolates
has enough cyanide in it

232
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,958
to kill a water buffalo!

233
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,375
[gasps]

234
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:08,083
[BUU] Buu like! Better than
chocolate made from people!

235
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,583
[MR. SATAN]
I have something else.

236
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,666
Let's see... Oh, here it is.
A-A video game!

237
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,250
[MAJIN BUU]
Video game?

238
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,208
[MR. SATAN] See, you just use
the little buttons at the bottom

239
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,708
to control the guys
and punch and kick.

240
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,583
[GAME]
You win.

241
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,125
[laughs]

242
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:29,250
[GAME]
Game Over.

243
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:30,625
Video game cheat!

244
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,541
[screams]

245
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,375
Oh, I-I'm sorry about that!

246
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,625
I'm sure I can find a game
in here that doesn't cheat!

247
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:48,875
[thinking] Time to introduce Mr.
Buu to Mr. Plastic Explosive.

248
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:49,666
[chuckles]

249
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,125
Bye.

250
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,916
[MR. SATAN] Oh yeah!
I've just got two words to say!

251
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,041
The end!

252
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,291
Buu really like when the
video game goes boom!

253
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,625
[BUU giggles]

254
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,291
Wow, that's the part
most people would hate.

255
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,458
Buu think you should be
my new play friend.

256
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:28,166
That, uh, sounds great to me.
I'm not busy or anything.

257
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:34,083
This candy made
from people good.

258
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,625
[gasps]

259
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,166
Try some, you eat.

260
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,625
Oh, of course.

261
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,750
Human candy is some of my
favorite stuff in the world!

262
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh, yeah, this candy is great.

263
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,458
It's sweet without
being too sweet,

264
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,416
kinda reminds me of the candy my
mom made me when I was a kid.

265
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,666
[MR. SATAN]
What's that?

266
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,500
What's what?

267
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,166
[MR. SATAN]
Huh? Huuh?

268
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,000
[BUU]
Huh...?

269
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,208
[growls, grunts]

270
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,666
[BUU]
What do you see?

271
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,375
I, uh, thought I saw a rabid
wolf or a poisonous rabbit

272
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,083
or something like that.

273
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,041
Buu make dead.

274
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,500
[BUU laughs]

275
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,958
[MR. SATAN] That was great.
Really, a magnificent shot.

276
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:22,041
Whatever that was over there,
you sure showed it who was boss!

277
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,666
I wouldn't want
to mess with you!

278
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,875
Uh, we're starting
to become friends,

279
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,458
so I think we should
preserve our new friendship

280
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,416
with, uh, some pictures!

281
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,625
[MR. SATAN] If you wouldn't
mind, lay down on belly

282
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,333
with your hands
out in front of you.

283
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,166
Like this?

284
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,416
[MR. SATAN]
I know it seems strange,

285
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,083
but this is the latest
style of picture taken.

286
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:49,583

There's one for the front page.

289
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,500
Say, Mr. Buu,
are you hungry at all?

290
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:01,083
I don't mean to brag,
but I'm a pretty good cook.

Oh sorry, I guess I
got a little bored there.

We can't thank you enough
for your hard work.

of your new strength yet?

[OLD KAI] The ritual ended
less than a minute ago, sonny.

All righty, then.

313
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,333
Now you just have to sit here
and keep your mind's eye focused

on all of your energies,

315

never leaving this
meditative state.

I can't move at all?

317
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,041
[OLD KAI]
That's what it's going to take!

318
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,833
Discipline and concentration.

319
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,791
Only then can you
acquire what you seek.

320
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,416
Are you saying
it's not worth it?

321
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,083
Huh?

It's worth it...

324

of the training ceremony,

329
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:33,583
his power will soon be increased
enough to combat Majin Buu.

330
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:36,833
But back on Earth,
how long will Mr. Satan

331
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,500
be able to hold
Buu's temper at bay?

[MR. SATAN] No, no,
allow me to wash your back.
