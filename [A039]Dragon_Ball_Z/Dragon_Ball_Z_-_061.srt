1
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,083
Frieza's elite fighters,
the Ginyu Force,

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,791
raced across the galaxy
toward Planet Namek,

4
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,750
equipped with new
scouters to speed

5
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,541
their evil master's search
for the Dragon Balls.

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,375
Meanwhile,
Krillin and Gohan

7
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,208
continued their
journey to see Guru.

8
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,708
I guess we can risk
picking up the pace a bit.

9
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,791
We should be far
enough away from Vegeta now

10
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,625
that he won't be
able to sense us.

11
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:36,916
Yeah, and not
only that,

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,750
my dad should be getting
here any minute now!

13
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,166
He'll need
our help!

14
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,000
[KRILLIN]
Let's go!

15
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,541
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately
for our heroes,

16
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,916
Vegeta was much closer
than they realized!

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,625
[VEGETA] Ah! I've
found them at last!

18
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:51,291
[NARRATOR] And with six Dragon
Balls already in his possession,

19
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,791
the Saiyan Prince
was determined

20
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,250
to have the
seventh at any cost!

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:59,875
They'll get no mercy
from me! They're dead!

22
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,250
[NARRATOR] Now, with
Vegeta hot on their trail,

23
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,500
Krillin and Gohan need
Guru's help more than ever.

24
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,541
But even if Guru can unlock
Gohan's hidden power,

25
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:12,583
are any of these warriors
ready to face the Ginyu Force?

26
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,208
Keep it up, Gohan!
We're getting close!

27
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,250
Guru's house should
be just ahead!

28
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,708
Right!

29
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,791
[thinking]
I don't know...

30
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,166
If Guru can release
Gohan's powers,

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,583
there's a chance he'll
be strong enough

32
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,125
that we can
take on Vegeta.

33
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,416
But the more I think about
it, I'm not so sure...

34
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,208
[VEGETA yells]

35
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,291
[VEGETA chuckles]

36
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,750
[thinking] That guy is
like a bottomless pit...

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,500
Somehow, he keeps pulling
out more and more power!

38
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,375
[KRILLIN growls]

39
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,041
[KRILLIN thinking] But if we
can just get Gohan powered-up

40
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,541
before Goku
gets here,

41
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,500
maybe the three of us
can beat Vegeta together!

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,291
9,999...

43
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:29,875
[GOKU grunts]

44
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,541
[GOKU] Ten thousand!

45
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,875
Wow! All that, and
I'm not even tired!

46
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,333
So much for hundred
times gravity!

47
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,541
[GOKU] I can't turn up
the machine any higher...

48
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, all
right, then!

49
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,208
I guess I'm as ready for
Planet Namek as I'll ever be!

50
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,708
In that case, it
might be a good idea

51
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,291
to get used to normal
gravity again...

52
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:15,333
[alarm beeping]

53
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,916
[GOKU] Huh...?

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,750
[beeping continues]

55
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,458
Huh?

56
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,666
Huh...

57
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,625
[GOKU laughs]

58
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,333
I can't believe I've
gotten this much stronger!

59
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:01,916
Incredible! I don't even
feel this gravity at all!

60
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,750
It's almost like
I'm weightless!

61
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,833
I feel light
as a feather!

62
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,458
Watch my speed!

63
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,083
I feel good!

64
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,708
[GOKU laughs]

65
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,875
Just watch
me now!

66
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:20,083
This is great!

67
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,916
I bet I could power
up my Kaio-Ken attack

68
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,333
times ten,
no problem!

69
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,791
Huh?

70
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,041
[GOKU] A wise
man once said,

71
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:39,291
"The harder you train,
then the stronger you smell!"

72
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,750
[GOKU laughs]

73
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,583
That's better. Now,
time for something to eat!

74
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:51,208
Let's see...
What am I in the mood for?

75
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,166
Ah! Just what I needed!

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,666
What's this doing in
here? It's no good...

77
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,375
There! Now that's what
I'm looking for!

78
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,333
A sports drink! It's
much less filling

79
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,875
and tastes great!

80
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:21,875
[GOKU snoring]

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,125
[VEGETA chuckling]

82
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,375
[thinking]
I have them...

83
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,750
They won't be able to
hide from me this time.

84
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,416
[KRILLIN] Gohan!
There it is!

85
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,583
Dead ahead! On top
of that tall peak!

86
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,458
That's
Guru's house!

87
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,208
I can't believe we
actually made it!

88
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,791
[KRILLIN laughs]

89
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,250
Hold it, Gohan!

90
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,541
I think we got
ourselves some company!

91
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,166
[GOHAN whimpers]

92
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,625
It's Vegeta!

93
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,458
I-I know...
What do we do?

94
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,375
Gohan...

95
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,458
I'll stay here and try to
hold him off for a while.

96
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,833
I want you to go on ahead
to Guru's house without me.

97
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:39,791
But, Krillin...

98
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't argue!
Just go! Now!

99
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,625
[KRILLIN growls]

100
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,125
[GOHAN whimpers]

101
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,583
Right!

102
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,291
[KRILLIN] Okay.
Come on, Vegeta.

103
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,416
[KRILLIN] Guh...

104
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,333
[thinking] How can I
compete with that?

105
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:25,791
Well...

106
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,166
Wh-What do you want, Vegeta?
How did you find us?

107
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,166
What do I want? Oh, I'm
just here to say hello...

108
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,250
Don't play
ignorant with me.

109
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,208
I want the four-star
Dragon Ball.

110
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,583
The one I had
hidden in the lake.

111
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,916
And I know
you've got it.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
[KRILLIN] I-I don't know
what you're talking about!

113
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,333
[VEGETA] Hmph... Is that so?

114
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,041
Well, we'll just
see about that.

115
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,291
Ah... Such
great power...

116
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:08,541
[VEGETA chuckling]

117
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,333
Huh? What's that?

118
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,333
There's a huge power-level
coming from that mountain.

119
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,833
So, that's where
you were headed.

120
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,291
Is that where you've hidden
the Dragon Ball as well?

121
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,833
No! You're wrong!

122
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,541
[KRILLIN]
Vegeta! Nooo!

123
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,583
[GURU coughing]

124
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,541
[GURU] I can feel that you have
truly amazing hidden powers.

125
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,875
The strongest
I've ever felt!

126
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,500
Please! I have to hurry! It's
Vegeta! He's right outside!

127
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:46,166
Are his
intentions pure?

128
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,625
[GURU] Hmm.

129
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,458
What is
this place?

130
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,708
Hey! Stop
right there!

131
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,333
I'm warning you!

132
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,416
Leave now.

133
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,291
Hmph. I don't think so.

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,875
[GOHAN panting]

135
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:26,041

138
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,583
Ha-ha!

139
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:44,500
[thinking] Gohan!
Guru did it!

140
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:48,500
That power... There's only
one person that could be...

141
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,916
So! You've come to settle
the score at last, have you?

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,041
Here I am, Kakarot!

143
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,500
Uhhh...

144
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,625
[VEGETA] Huh?

145
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,333
[VEGETA chuckles]

146
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,791
What?!

147
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,125
[VEGETA] You?! But your...
Your power level...

148
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,208
What is this place?
What have you done?!

149
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,000
[KRILLIN chuckles]

150
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,083
[VEGETA chuckles]

151
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,083
Huh?

152
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:57,833
[VEGETA laughing]

153
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,500
What? Am I supposed
to be scared now,

154
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:04,041
just because you've gotten
a little "power boost"?

155
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,666
It changes
nothing!

156
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,916
You're still nowhere
near my level.

157
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,708
So go ahead if you
want! Attack me!

158
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,958
Your move.

159
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,750
What is it, Guru?

160
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:33,208
[GURU] Dende, my child...

161
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,458
What's wrong?

162
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:37,833
Please... You must go
and warn the others...

163
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,333
I can sense that
there is an

164
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:42,875
incredibly powerful force
approaching our planet...

165
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,166
[GURU coughs]

166
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,375
Are you all
right, Guru?

167
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,250
[GURU] Go,
Dende. Quickly!

168
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,708
Right!

169
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,708
Hey... Hey!
Listen!

170
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,041
Guru just told me there's
some kind of powerful force

171
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,666
headed straight for us!

172
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,583
What?

173
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,125
What in the...?
Who's this Guru?

174
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,500
Hey! He's right!
Something is coming!

175
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,166
Yeah! That power
level's huge!

176
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,875
Wait! I know!
It's Goku!

177
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,166
I knew he'd be
here to save us!

178
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,625
Kakarot?!

179
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,916
[GOHAN] I dunno...
Are you sure, Krillin?

180
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,166
It feels like there's
more than one...

181
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,416
No! Not them!

182
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,791
[VEGETA] One... Two...
Three... Four... Five...

183
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,125
It... It has to be...
Damn it all!

184
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,041
Frieza's called in
the Ginyu Force!

185
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,750
You! No more
time for games!

186
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,708
Give me that
Dragon Ball right now!

187
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:58,791
I... I can't!
I don't have it!

188
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,250
Tell me
where it is!

189
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,041
Tell me, and I promise no
harm will come to you,

190
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,125
or your friends!

191
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,333
But if I don't
make my wish

192
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,000
before they get here,
we're all dead!

193
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,958
[KRILLIN] What do you
think we are? Stupid?

194
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,791
You put him down.
Right now, Vegeta.

195
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,666
Listen to me!
Don't be a fool!

196
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,750
These are no petty
henchman Frieza's called,

197
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,291
it's the Ginyu Force!

198
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,208
Five men each as
strong as I am.

199
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,541
Maybe even
stronger!

200
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,625
And in a few moments,
they'll be here

201
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,875
with their
new scouters.

202
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,458
They'll find us
and kill us all!

203
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,375
No... I-I don't
believe you!

204
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,083
[VEGET] Do you
feel that power?!

205
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,166
None of us are strong
enough to face that!

206
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,625
We only have
one chance.

207
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,000
We have to use the Dragon
Balls to make me immortal!

208
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,041
[NAIL] I fear what the
Saiyan says may be true.

209
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:53,416
This is an evil presence
that approaches...

210
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,250
Here's the deal:
We use the wish on Gohan!

211
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,458
The boy may
have power,

212
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,375
but he doesn't have the
fighting experience!

213
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,916
It has to be me!

214
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,333
I can't do it!
That would mean...

215
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:19,958
our entire search
would be in vain!

216
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,625
But you would still
have two more wishes.

217
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:26,916
[VEGETA growling]

218
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,166
Didn't you know?

219
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,375
The Dragon Balls will
grant you three wishes.

220
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,833
Uh... Three? Are you
sure about that?

221
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:38,458
Not... just one?

222
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,375
We're wasting time!

223
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,291
The Ginyu Force will
be here any second!

224
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:48,125
We have to use the Dragon Balls
now, before it's too late!

225
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,291
You're not giving the
orders here, Vegeta!

226
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,875
Nail, are you
absolutely certain

227
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,250
that we'll
get three wishes?

228
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,708
Yes.

229
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,208
Let's go, then.

230
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,791
But, you try
anything funny

231
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,125
and the deal's off,
you got it? Follow me!

232
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,208
[GOHAN] Hey! Wait up!

233
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,958
This is crazy!

234
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:18,125
Just fly as
fast as you can!

235
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,833
So then,
have they gone?

236
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,916
[NAIL] Yes. But even
if they do get

237
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,416
the Dragon
Balls in time,

238
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,416
I don't much
like their chances.

239
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,833
Can't you
help them?

240
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,000
[GURU] Dende's right.

241
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,083
I think you should join
them in this battle.

242
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,000
It might help their
chance at victory.

243
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,083
But what about--?

244
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,375
[GURU] Don't worry
about me, my son.

245
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:53,041
I don't plan on leaving
this world just yet.

246
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,041
[GURU chuckles]

247
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:02,416
[NAIL] I will do
as you wish.

248
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,291
[FRIEZA giggles]

249
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,250
[FRIEZA] At last,
my precious Ginyu Force

250
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,000
has finally arrived.
And right on schedule!

251
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:53,541
[FRIEZA laughs]

252
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,166
[VEGETA] We're
running out of time!

253
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,000
The Ginyu Force has landed!

254
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,500
[thinking] Just a
little farther...

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,625
[BULMA sighs]

256
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,916
I just wish they'd
hurry up and come back...

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,166
[BULMA screams]

258
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,000
Hey, what's
the big idea?!

259
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,291
[KRILLIN] Sorry!
No time to explain, Bulma!

260
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,125
I need the
Dragon Ball!

261
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,583
[VEGETA] Quickly, now!
Follow me to the others!

262
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,500
Hey, hang on a second!
Come back!

263
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,500
What's going on?!

264
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,916
Do you have any idea
what I went through

265
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,208
for that stupid
Dragon Ball?!

266
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,833
You could at least
fill me in!

267
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,416
Come on! I'm
going nuts here!

268
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,375
Come back here!
Youuu...!

269
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,791
Krillin and
Vegeta... Ugh!

270
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:58,708
What the...? What was
Krillin doing with Vegeta?!

271
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,666
[FRIEZA chuckling]

272
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,416
[FRIEZA laughing]

273
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:55,291
[growling]

274
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm Recoome!

275
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,583
[hissing]

276
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,333
Burter!

277
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,708
Oh, yeah!

278
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,583
I'm Jeice!

279
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,916
[growling]

280
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,125
[yells]

281
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,458
Guldo!

282
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,916
Captain Ginyu!

283
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,083
Now! You! See! The! Power!

284
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,333
[ALL] Of the Ginyu Force!

285
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:09,166
[FRIEZA] Uhh...

286
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,583
Well, that's quite
an entrance, boys.

287
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:25,750
[ALL] Heh!

288
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,833
[NARRATOR] With the
Ginyu Force by his side,

289
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,958
is Frieza on the verge of
taking over the universe?

290
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:35,000
Or will Vegeta's new alliance
with Gohan and Krillin prove

291
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:37,333
to be a sufficient
deterrence?

292
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:41,541
It's a race for survival,
and every second counts!

293
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,333
Can our heroes get to the
remaining Dragon Balls

294
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,083
in time to summon the Dragon
and make their wish?

295
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,083
There's only one
way to find out...

296
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:55,416
Tune in for the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
