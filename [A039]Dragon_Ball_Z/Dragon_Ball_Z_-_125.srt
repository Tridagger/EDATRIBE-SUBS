[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,333
a stranger from the future
arrived to inform

3
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:21,583
Goku and the others they
had three years to prepare

4
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,333
for the arrival of
two evil androids,

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:27,166

than any enemy

the Earth and everything you
know will be gone for good.

the advice of Trunks,

their training.

11

Vegeta is training
like never before.

12
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,583
And he won't stop until he's
become a Super Saiyan

13
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,833

this ominous message

00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,375
from the future lightly,
and neither is Goku!

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,583
Together, they're
training night and day

18
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,083
in the hope that
they will be ready to

19
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,958
meet head on whatever
challenges might lie ahead.

[NARRATOR] Gohan is growing
stronger by the day as well.

21
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,333

to teach his dad a thing or two

22

I'll be! It's him!
It's Master Roshi!

40

Except his nose is a bit bigger.

And that cloud
looks like Piccolo.

can have it for dinner?

That's all we've had
for two weeks straight!

Now, let me get this straight:

79
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,541
You expect me to get dinner
ready and wash your clothes

80
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,958
while you and Gohan relax
in a nice hot bath?!

81
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,041
Well that's not going
to happen mister!

82
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,666
Do you even care what
kind of day I've had?!

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,208
I don't know what
I liked better:

84
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,416
being chased half way
home by a wild boar,

85
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,000
or walking the rest of the
way on my tired, aching feet!

86
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,583
And it's all because
we don't have a car!

87
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,000
Uh, ChiChi, I'd drive
you if I could.

88
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,416
But you know I don't have
a driver's license yet.

89
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,416
Well, it's time you got one!

90
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,208
I don't know why you have to
be the only man in this town

91
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,208
who doesn't have a
driver's license or a car!

92

You can't drive can you?

93
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,791
LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS!

94
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,583
I want both of you to put
your training on hold for now

95
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,000
and go to driving
school tomorrow!

96
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,583
I think it's about
time the two of you

97
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:54,000
learned something
useful for a change.

98
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,791

do we have too?

Listen, all I'm
asking you two to do

101
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,416
is get your driver's license.

102
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,541
It's not like I'm asking
you to save the world.

103
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:07,583
And if you don't...

104
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,458
you'll have to cook your
own meals from now on!

00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,458
Mom, we don't
have time for that!

353
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,333
Thanks! Bye!

354
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's do it!

355
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,083
[NARRATOR] The time has come
for Goku and the others to unite

356
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,125
and face the two killer androids

357
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,125
that Trunks warned them
about three years ago!

358
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:20,041
[TRUNKS] Only you can change
the course of the future now.

359
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:21,583
Please stop them!

360
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,333
You've got to destroy
the androids

361
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:25,291
that Dr. Gero will create.

362
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:28,458
The future of this
planet is at stake.

363
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,583
You and your friends must
change the path of the future.

364
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,375
You are the last chance!
Please stop them!

365
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,333
Ready or not, Goku and the
others have a date with destiny!

366
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:45,666
A destiny that depends
on them defeating an enemy

367
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,541
more powerful than any
they have ever faced before!

368
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,333
It should be a piece of cake!

369
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,583
on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
