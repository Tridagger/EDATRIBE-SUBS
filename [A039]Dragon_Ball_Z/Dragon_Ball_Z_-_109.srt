00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,875
there was a festive gathering
at Master Roshi's

3
00:02:17,958 --> 00:02:20,833
and Gohan didn't want
to miss out on the fun.

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:24,250
So he snuck away from his house
without his mom's permission.

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,375
Let's blaze. What'dya say?

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,416
[chuckles lowly]

7
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,833
Shh!

8
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,666
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Kami's Lookout was under siege.

9
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,166
And when Mr. Popo tried
to make a run for it,

10
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,083
he was ensnared in a net.

11
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,041
[[WARRIORS laugh]

12
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,041
[MR. POPO] Magic carpet!

13
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,583
[BOTH] Righ, Boss! Huah!

14
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:45,166
[NARRATOR]
To add to his humiliation,

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,583
and to Kami's anger,

16
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,333
Garlic Jr. reduced
Mr. Popo to pocket size.

17
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,500
Don't have a
heart attack, old man.

18
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,041
I don't want
you to die before...

19
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,875
[NARRATOR] But Kami wasn't
going to take this sitting down.

20
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:01,666
It was an all out war
against the greedy ghoul.

21
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,500
But after a sneak attack
by Garlic Jr.'s henchmen,

22
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,833
Kami was captured, and, he too,

23
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,791
was reduced to the size
of an action-figure.

24
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,958
[NARRATOR] It was a dark day
for the earth indeed,

25
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:18,208
when Garlic Jr. uncorked
the dreaded Black Water Mist.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,083
[GARLIC JR.] When people breath
this mist, any evil tendencies

27
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,916
that they're resisting take
control of their character.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,833
You see, boys,
our army of darkness

29
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:34,708
has always been here.
We just have to wake it up.

30
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,416
Yeah. You've really outdone
yourself this time, Boss.

31
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,625
[GARLIC JR.] Why thank you.

32
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,041
[NARRATOR] What sinister
plan does Garlic Jr.

33
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,625
have in store for the earth?

34
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,833
Find out, today!

35
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:58,291
[birds chirping]

36
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,875
[GIRL] Oh no.
What's wrong with me?

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,666
I feel so... I feel...

38
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,125
[screeches]

39
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,250
[GARLIC JR.] The Black Water
Mist has been released

40
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,875
upon the earth, Father.

41
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:26,416
Just as you would have wanted.

42
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,916
They're weak, so weak,
these Earthlings.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like sheep, lost sheep,
without the strength of will

44
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,250
to resist the dark side.

45
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,333
[GARLIC JR.] They only
need a ruler, Father,

46
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:41,333
to lead them further and
further into the darkness.

47
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,250
[laughs]

48
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,416
And they'll have one,
when I wish you back.

49
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,500
[GARLIC JR.]
What's taking so long, Spice?

50
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,291
[SPICE] Lord. Please
be patient with me.

51
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,958
[GARLIC JR.] More waiting?
I've waited too long already.

52
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:05,666
How hard could it be to find
a kid with that fancy mirror?

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,125
What are you looking at,
you boobs?

54
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,833
I'll bet you two
know who I'm looking for.

55
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:17,916
For the ones responsible for
locking me in the Dead Zone.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,250
Hm!

57
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:23,500
[GARLIC JR.] Goku and his
little runt, Gohan. Mmm.

58
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,541
[CHICHI] Gohan?! Gohan.
Where are you?!

59
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,333
You'd better get over
here this instant.

60
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,500
Uh! Gohan, how could you?! Ah!

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,541
It's Krillin and
those friends of his.

62
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,625
I'll bet they talked him
into doing this.

63
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,458
Are those silly karate bums
ever going to grow up?

64
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:43,916
Life is not just an interval
between Kung Fu matches?!

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,375
[CHICHI yells]

66
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,541
[GOHAN laughs]

67
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:52,583
How great. Getting to see
everybody again. Man.

68
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:59,083
[GOHAN] Ha, ha, ha.
Whoa. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

69
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,875
Ahhh. That was great, Icarus.

70
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Ah...

71
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,500
[birds cawing]

72
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,041
Hm?!

73
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:12,875
Huh?!

74
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,375
[commotion]

75
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,833
Huh?!

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,208
[GOHAN] Ooh, that doesn't
look good, Icarus. Be careful.

77
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:27,416
Whoa. Let's get outta here.
Don't touch it.

78
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,875
[ICARUS bleats]

79
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,416
[GOHAN] Whoa! Hey!

80
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,791
Ow! He bucked me. Like a bronc'.

81
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,250
[GOHAN] I wonder what that
stuff was?! It was horrible.

82
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,666
[ICARUS mutters]

83
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,916
It's gone now. Hm?

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,750
[GOHAN] Oh. Hello.

85
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,375
[snarls]

86
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:04,708
Ahhh. Hey, there.

87
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,875
[screeches]

88
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
Huh?! Waaaa.

89
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,791
Huh?!

90
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:18,833
[snarling and growling]

91
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,333
Icarus. Easy, boy.
There's too many of them.

92
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,083
[GOHAN yells]

93
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,291
[GOHAN] Icarus, jump.

94
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,083
Oh, man. Whoa. What's up?!
They're freaking.

95
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,291
Gosh. How weird. Man.

96
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,125
[GOHAN] I thought I was
gonna lose you, Icarus.

97
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:49,916
[snarls]

98
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,125
Easy there, Popo.

99
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,416
You might as well
conserve your energy.

100
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,583
That was try number
ninety-six, wasn't it?!

101
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,291
No. Seven. Please, one more.

102
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,875
I just can't sit here and wait.

103
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,500
If everyone breathes the mist,

104
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,541
[MR. POPO] there'll be
no one left to help.

105
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:14,541
Yes. I'm afraid
you're right, Mr. Popo.

106
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:16,583
I should have seen this coming.

107
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,750
[KAMI] Garlic Jr.
and his father, Garlic,

108
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
seek only to destabilize.

109
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,291
Their bitter pledge
is to make Earth a home

110
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,958
for the serpent race.

111
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,416
A race of spirits who work
for their own satisfaction

112
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,291
out of pride and lack of love.

113
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:34,541
They are blind, Mr. Popo.

114
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,875
They have forgotten that
they too have a part to play

115
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,833
in the Grand Design,
so they seek to tear it down.

116
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,791
And so they march,
time and time again,

117
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:47,875
with every age and every
epoch, doomed to failure.

118
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,125
Destined to become victims
of the very seeds of discord

119
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,125
that they, themselves,
have sown.

120
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,916
[screams]

121
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,416
[KAMI] But they've got a firm
foothold this time, Mr. Popo.

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,958
And it's going to take some
real doing to stop them.

123
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,583
I only wish Goku were here.

124
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,416
Yes, he would stop them
in their tracks.

125
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,125
[gasps]

126
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,500
[SPICE] Sir, it's the kid.
We found him.

127
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,333
Huh?! Show me.

128
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,625
[SPICE] At least I think
it's him, Lord Garlic.

129
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,291
[giggles]

130
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,958
Yes, it's him. Good.

131
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,250
All right, boys,
go get that kid.

132
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,375
Then we won't need to find Goku.

133
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,416
Yes. He'll come walking
right into our hands.

134
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,791
[GARLIC JR. laughs]

135
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:45,083
[ROSHI giggles]

136
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,958
[KRILLIN yells]

137
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,000
[laughing]

138
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,000
Yo, good job.
They're laughing at you.

139
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,208
You're really making their day.

140
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,500
[YAMCHA] Try using the
pointy end, Krillin.

141
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,583
Yo. Why don't you get out here
and try, big mouth.

142
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:10,958
Hey, forget it.

143
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,625
I'm not the one
who promised Maron

144
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,583
we were having fish
for dinner. Remember?!

145
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,500
[BOTH laugh]

146
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
[MARON] Krillin!

147
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,458
[BOTH] Huh?

148
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,416
Hey. I'll help you.

149
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Look out, fish! Here I come!

150
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,958
Oh my gosh.

151
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,000
[ROSHI] Oh, ho, ho yeah!

152
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,000
Come to papa, baby.

153
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,291
[ROSHI] Old Roshi's got
something to show ya.

154
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,750
[laughs]

155
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,916
[MARON] Hey, Krillin.
What's the deal?

156
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,750
You're not giving up, are you?!

157
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,458
Well, are you?!

158
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,625
No way.

159
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,250
Yo! Heads up!

160
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,875
Huh?!

161
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,500
[KRILLIN yells]

162
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,166
[ROSHI yells]

163
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,708
Man overboard.

164
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,166
All right, guys.
Where is Gohan?! Answer me!

165
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,875
Uh, he's... not here.

166
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,541
Fine. I'll wait then.

167
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,208
Good. Fortunately
it's not too late

168
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,958
to nip this in the bud.

169
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,458
He doesn't need any
bad influences right now.

170
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,750
What?! Bad influence?!

171
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,541
ChiChi, these guys
saved the planet.

172
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,541
Yeah. So?

173
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,750
Come on! Loosen up!

174
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,708
[gasps] Who are you?!

175
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,583
A friend. I was invited here.
But I don't think you were!

176
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,416
[grunts]

177
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,916
All right, you!
You'd better stay out of this!

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,083
[MARON giggles]
You're just a jealous old lady.

179
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:06,083
[ALL] Uh...

180
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,875
You should go home.

181
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,916
Your grandson's obviously
not here right now.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,083
[giggles]

183
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,458
But I can see why
he needed to get away.

184
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,541
Why you...!

185
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,791
That does it. I hope
you like black and blue

186
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:25,166
'cause you're gonna be
wearing it for a while.

187
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,208
[ROSHI] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
ChiChi, please.

188
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,125
Control yourself.
She doesn't know any better.

189
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,916
She didn't mean it.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Hey! Watch it! You're even
worse than the old lady.

191
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,041
[CHICHI] Why you little!

192
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,500
Hey Krillin!

193
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,208
C'mon, Maron. Hurry. Let's go.

194
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,958
Okay. Bye, Grandma.
Don't come back.

195
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,416
That's it! She's dead!

196
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,000
Someone needs to
teach that vixen a lesson.

197
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,458
[CHICHI] Let go!

198
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,791
[ROSHI hollers, giggles]

199
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,000
[CHICHI] Let me go!

200
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,375
I'll step on your feet!
That girl's history!

201
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,000
This isn't fair! Let me go!

202
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,458
[CHICHI] Let go!

203
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:24,458
Babe, you gotta be more careful.

204
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,916
Who, me?!

205
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,708
Yeah, you. That's not
an ordinary lady

206
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,291
you're looking at there.

207
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,708
[KRILLIN] ChiChi's one of the
strongest women on the planet.

208
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,583
Even Goku's afraid of her.

209
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,291
You've mentioned
him before. Who is he?!

210
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:41,958
He's my friend. The one
from outer-space, remember?!

211
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,125
I told you about ten times!

212
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,166
Whatever.

213
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,416
Krillin...!

214
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,416
[CHICHI] Let go of me!

215
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,166
Somebody's got to
teach that girl some manners!

216
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,666
Ugh! What a fool!

217
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,750
I've never met anyone
that acted like that before.

218
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,125
What a spoiled, little brat!

219
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,375
[gasps]

220
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,000
[CHICHI screams]

221
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,291
[chuckles]

222
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,583
Y'know what?! They're going
to be surprised to see me! Ha!

223
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,791
[GOHAN] What's up, boy?!

224
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,583
[MARON] Gotcha.

225
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,541
Ahhh. Hey, guys.

226
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,041
Huh?

227
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,583
Gohan. All right!

228
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,375
Yeah! See. I made it.

229
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,291
Awesome. You're great.

230
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,458
[GOHAN] Thanks, Maron.

231
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,791
Don't mention it, kid.

232
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,250
I like your friend,
he's really cute.

233
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,166
Don't you think? Huh?

234
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,708
Uhh, cute? Well, I... guess so.

235
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,666
Hey, Gohan, there's trouble
afoot, bro. Your ma's here.

236
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,708
Huh?! Oh no, my mom? Bummer!

237
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,458
Boy, yeah. I feel
sorry for you, Gohan.

238
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:27,166
Yeah, whoa.
She's gone ballistic.

239
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,416
Mhmm.

240
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,041
Oh, man.

241
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,208
[MARON] Here I come!

242
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,625
Huh?!

243
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,791
Hi, what's you're name?

244
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,166
Hey, I know how you can
get these guys off the hook.

245
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,416
Take the blame! Go tell her
that it's your fault.

246
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,083
What?! Me?!
Are you out of your mind?!

247
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,625
I don't have a death wish!

248
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, I get it now.
You don't really respect me.

249
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,708
You think I'm dumb.

250
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,541
No, no I don't.

251
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,916
Then you'll try my idea?!

252
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,333
Oh, all right.
I'll take the fall, Gohan.

253
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,875
Wow. What a friend. Thank you.

254
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,708
Krillin, you're great! Wow!

255
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,958
[MARON] Where is everybody?!

256
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,958
[KRILLIN]
I guess they're all inside.

257
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,083
Chin up, kid.

258
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,375
Okay, Krillin. Get ready.

259
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,166
Mm.

260
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,625
[KRILLIN] I don't know, guys.

261
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,833
I got a funny
feeling about this.

262
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
[growls]

263
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,541
Huh?!

264
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,166
Uhhh. Mom, what's up?!

265
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,583
It's my fault, ChiChi.
I-I'm sorry.

266
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,125
I talked Gohan
into coming here.

267
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:09,083
Gosh, Mom. I'm really sorry.
I was wrong. Hm?!

268
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,833
Ahh. Gohan, are you okay?!

269
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,375
Hey, you better
back off there, Grandma.

270
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,291
Oh, boy o' boy.

271
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,541
[KRILLIN] Gosh, ChiChi,
that was pretty severe.

272
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,625
[breathy hiss]

273
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,000
Gosh, Mom.

274
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,458
[GOHAN] Yikes!

275
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,291
Aaah...

276
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh. Maron! Now you
got her all fired-up

277
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,291
with that Grandma stuff.

278
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,500
Yeah, but she hit him.

279
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,166
[CHICHI grunting]

280
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,833
[KRILLIN] Oh! Thank goodness.

281
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:51,333
It's going to take all of us
to stop her this time, guys!

282
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,958
She's really flipped!

283
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,250
Whoa. I'm sorry, Mom.

284
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,250
I'll be a good boy
from now on, I promise.

285
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,375
I'll study hard
and I'll do everything

286
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,458
[GOHAN] that you tell me to do.

287
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,625
Mom, what's wrong?
You've never tried to

288
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:35,125
[GOHAN]
hurt me like this before.

289
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,125
Ahhh! Get away fom me, you!

290
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,125
[yelling]

291
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,166
Krillin! Help me!

292
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,708
I'm trying, Maron. But I kind
of have my hands full here.

293
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,125
Guys? If we've offended you
somehow, we're really sorry.

294
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,208
Something's not right here, man.

295
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:00,875
They're freakin' out.

296
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,333
Huh?!

297
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,541
Man. What in the world
is going on here?

298
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,333
[growling]

299
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,250
[BOTH grunting]

300
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,791
[thud]

301
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,541
Oh no, Mom.
I hope you're not hurt.

302
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,708
Man, Krillin!

303
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:46,708
They mean business, Gohan.
Be careful or they'll hurt you.

304
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,541
[GOHAN]
Mom, what's wrong with you?

305
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:54,958
[KRILLIN] Gohan, look out!

306
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,833
[GOHAN]
What are we going to do?

307
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,958
[screams]

308
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:06,375
[ROSHI] Come here, my dear.
There's nothing to be scared of.

309
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,583
[MARON yells]

310
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:13,416
[chuckles]

311
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,750
[yells]

312
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,333
[MARON crying]

313
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,500
[KRILLIN] It's okay, Maron.
You're fine.

314
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:30,041
[WARRIORS chuckle]

315
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,416
[VINEGAR] Party's over, kiddo.

316
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,208
Oh, great. Who are these goons?

317
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:36,458
Huh?! Mom, what are
you doing? Get up.

318
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,291
[GOHAN] Guys, what's going on?

319
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,083
[MUSTARD] They inhaled
the Black Water Mist, kid.

320
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,041
They belong to us now.

321
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,416
[GOHAN] Oh, no they don't.
That's my mom.

322
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,666
And those are our friends.

323
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,833
They belong to us.

324
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,083
[SALT] Why don't you ask them?

325
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,500
Gohan, wait.

326
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:57,375
No. I'm not scared. These freaks
did something to my mom.

327
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,458
We sure did. So?

328
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,583
So you'd better
change her back right now.

329
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,416
[SALT chuckles]
We can't, you dope.

330
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,625
Only the Sacred Water kept
at Kami's Lookout can do that.

331
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,250
Sacred Water?

332
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,500
That's right. But Kami's on
an extended leave of absence.

333
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
Too bad, aye? But don't worry.

334
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,958
Our boss is
guardian now. Garlic Jr.

335
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,916
[SPICE] Oh, I see
you remember him.

336
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,750
Lord Garlic will be pleased.

337
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,583
Yes, indeed he will.

338
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,916
Give up, kid.
You're outnumbered.

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,541
[yells]

340
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,500
[SPICE] It's no use, kid.

341
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,125
The more you struggle,
the tighter the hold becomes.

342
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,500
It's hard to believe
that a small-fry like you

343
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:47,041
trapped Garlic Jr.
in the Dead Zone.

344
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,125
[laughs]

345
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,875
Piccolo.

346
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,458
Yes! Piccolo!

347
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,083
[chuckles]

348
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:13,750
Good. Yeah, this'll be fun.

349
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,083
Fun? You slither around
in the darkness,
