00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:18,500
Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan
reached Piccolo's homeworld

3
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:21,125
of Namek in their quest
for the Dragon Balls.

4
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,000
Little did they know,
the forces of evil

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:27,125
were also converging on
this once peaceful planet.

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,500
The worst among them...
The sinister Lord Frieza.

7
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,916
Who, with his merciless
band of henchmen,

8
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
had already
managed to sweep

9
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,666
four of the seven Dragon
Balls into his clutches...

10
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Lord Frieza, we've
detected a group of Nameks,

11
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,875
not far in
that direction.

12
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,750
Well, that's good news.

13
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,250
And with any luck,

14
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,500
they'll have the fifth Dragon
Ball in their possession.

15
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,458
[NARRATOR] As these villains
scoured the planet,

16
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,500
it was all our three
young heroes could do

17
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,125
to stay out
of harm's way.

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,916
[KRILLIN] They'll catch us if we
don't find a place to hide!

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,625
[BULMA panting]

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,500
I found a cave. It should
be a great spot to lie low.

21
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,541
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
trouble has come

22
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:06,666
looking for them!

23
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,208
And they're about
to come face-to-face

24
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,083
with the greatest evil they
have ever known... Today!

25
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,625
On Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,833
[GOHAN] Krillin, are
you sensing that?

27
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,291
That energy...

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,291
Yeah, it feels pretty strong,
and it's still rising!

29
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,625
Whoever that is, it's--

30
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,166
Trouble! Everyone!
Into the cave!

31
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,666
What's going on?

32
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,333
Bulma, get in here!

33
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,416
[BULMA] I'm coming!
I'm coming!

34
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,291
[BULMA] Now are you gonna tell
me what's going on or not?

35
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,250
I don't see anything!

36
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,458
[KRILLIN] Shh! Quiet.
They're coming right for us.

37
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,458
So what do you think?
Do you think they spotted us?

38
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,083
I don't know...

39
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,291
[KRILLIN] There!

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,583
[BULMA squealing]

41
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,333
[squealing continues]

42
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,291
It looks like
they're gone.

43
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,750
That was close. But I don't
think they noticed us.

44
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,666
They didn't even slow
down at all. I don't know.

45
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,875
They must be heading
after something else.

46
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:57,666
Huh?

47
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,833
[KRILLIN whimpering]

48
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,333
[GOHAN panting]

49
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,916
What is it, you guys?
What's the matter?

50
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:14,333
[KRILLIN] Bulma, you'd better
check the Dragon Radar...

51
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,750
'Kay. But why?

52
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,166
When... When we
checked it before,

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,208
those four Dragon
Balls we saw,

54
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,166
all gathered in the same
place... Look again.

55
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,583
See if they're
still there.

56
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,875
Yeah, sure.
I got it.

57
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,666
[BULMA] They're... They're
moving. All four of them!

58
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,208
Whoever those
guys are,

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,625
they have the Dragon
Balls with them!

60
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,125
[KRILLIN] I was
afraid of that...

61
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,041
This is bad.
Real bad.

62
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,500
Gohan!

63
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
[KRILLIN] Gohan!

64
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,958
[GOHAN] Sorry.

65
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,791
[KRILLIN] Believe me,
I understand.

66
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,166
So you saw that guy
flying near the front?

67
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah... Yeah, I
saw him all right.

68
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,250
H-He was
like, pure evil.

69
00:05:56,333 --> 00:06:00,250
And his power level's the
highest I've ever sensed.

70
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,750
Me too. And I've
got a bad feeling

71
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,583
this is the same guy
those kids told us about.

72
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:08,083
I don't know. It might not
be Frieza, but either way

73
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,125
our situation has just
gotten a whole lot worse.

74
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,291
Why? I mean, he can't be
stronger than Vegeta, can he?

75
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,291
I'd say he is and not just
a little bit, either.

76
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
I mean a lot.

77
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,083
Not to mention all those
other guys he had with him.

78
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:23,375
And we've gotta
figure out a way

79
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,750
to get the Dragon
Balls from them!

80
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,291
How're we
gonna do that?

81
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:29,083
Quick, quick, look!

82
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,041
They're heading directly
for another Dragon Ball.

83
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,375
It's like they know
just where it is!

84
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,666
[KRILLIN] Oh, that's just great!
So they have radar, too.

85
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,791
Which way?

86
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,333
[BULMA] Over there.
The Dragon Radar

87
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,416
says it's about
ten miles that way.

88
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,250
Hey, Krillin, while
we were walking,

89
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,750
didn't you sense a
group of Namekians

90
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,291
coming from
that direction?

91
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,750
Right. Well,
I guess we better go

92
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,208
find out what's up.

93
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,416
I'm going with you!

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
What?! Are you
guys nuts?

95
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:59,041
What about me?! You can't just
leave me here all by myself!

96
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,875
[KRILLIN] All right. You can
come chase the bad guys

97
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,416
with us if
you really want.

98
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,750
Well, I suppose I
could come along.

99
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:07,208
But, then again, it might
be best for one of us

100
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,875
to stay and hold down the
fort, don't you think?

101
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,166
Good idea, Bulma.

102
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,208
Now, don't do
anything stupid!

103
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,791
Remember, Gohan, keep your
power level pushed down

104
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,291
so they don't spot us
coming. Think you got it?

105
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah.

106
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:30,000
Be safe, you guys. I can't
make it home without you.

107
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,208
Which reminds me, I'd
better call Master Roshi

108
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,750
and let him know
what's going on!

109
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,791
[RADIO] In other news,

as its citizens work
to reclaim their city

I'm coming. I'm coming.
Keep your pants on.

Roshi here.
Oh, Bulma!

120
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:03,291
So, how are things
going up there on Namek?

121
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,500
What? WHAT?! Oh no...

122
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,916
Say, Doc, so
when do you think

123
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,833
I'll be able to start
working out again?

124
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,833
Goku, what is
wrong with you?

125
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,500
I'm afraid you're going
to have to rest up

126
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,458
for at least a
little while yet.

127
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,416
Aw, Come on, Doc!
I'm getting weaker

128
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,291
by the minute just
sitting here in bed!

129
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,458
Knock, knock!
Hello in there!

Hello, everyone!
Good to see you.

132
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,208
Um, is ChiChi around
here anywhere?

133
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,000
Why, yes, as a matter of
fact, she is around here.

134
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,791
Oops! I-I mean, hi!

135
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,416
Don't get any ideas.
I'll be right back.

136
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,541
Yeesh...
Touchy thing!

137
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,500
Goku, big news
from Namek.

138
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,416
I just got a hold of
Bulma a little while ago.

139
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,333
[NURSE screaming]

140
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,791
What are you doing?!

141
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,333
Oh, sorry, I, uh, talk with
my hands when I'm excited.

142
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,000
So, then, how are
they? Is Gohan okay?

143
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:06,208
Well, you know,
they all arrived

144
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,000
on the planet
safely. But...

145
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,958
I'm afraid the good
news ends there...

146
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,333
See, it's Vegeta...
Evidently, he's on Namek, too,

147
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:17,083
completely healed and
stronger than ever.

148
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,333
No way!
Vegeta?!

149
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,041
And believe it or not,
it gets worse.

150
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,625
It looks like there's
someone else there.

151
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,958
An evil being,
stronger than Vegeta!

152
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,875
On top of that, Bulma
said their spaceship's

153
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,375
been damaged
in an attack.

154
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:31,333
She doesn't think
she can fix it.

155
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:32,916
So, they're stuck there?

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,583
[ROSHI] It seems they need help
in more ways than one right now.

157
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:38,625
I'm just worried about
this stronger force.

158
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,958
Yeah, me too.

159
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,208
I mean, someone even more
powerful than Vegeta?

160
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,041
Who could it be?

161
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,833
Hey, what's going on?

162
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,416
Actually, I don't
really wanna know.

163
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,916
But I got somethin' here
that should cheer you up.

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,916
It took forever, so I
hope you're grateful.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,541
A gift from Korin.

166
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,458
One bag of
fresh-picked Senzu beans.

167
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,458
Should have you up
and runnin' in no time.

168
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,583
Oh, yeah! Yajirobe!
Perfect timing!

169
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,875
You have no idea how
much I need those!

170
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,166
Hold on. You're not giving any
strange foods to my patient!

171
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,625
Sorry, Doc.

00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,750
[chuckling]

174
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,291
This is great!

175
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,333
I've been waiting forever to
get out of these dinky pajamas.

176
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
And back into the uniform
King Kai gave me!

177
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:44,291
Yeah... Finally!

178
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,541
There! Now no time
to waste. Off to Planet Namek!

179
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,875
Thanks for the
Senzu Beans.

180
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,833
From the sound of things,
I think I'll need 'em.

181
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:57,333
But, Goku! How in the world are
you planning to get to Namek?

182
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,583
Oh, well, when Bulma's dad came
to visit not too long ago,

183
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,750
I asked him if he could build
another spaceship for me.

184
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,166
I thought it'd be
good to have one,

185
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,833
in case something
like this came up.

186
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,375
Oh, so then he figured out how
to build a ship like Kami's?

187
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,833
No. He
couldn't do that.

188
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,875
He said Kami's ship was made
with a bunch of materials

189
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,041
that are probably
only found on Namek.

190
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,458
What? So...

191
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,500
So, I remembered
the ship I came in here

192
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:21,041
as a baby was
never destroyed.

193
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,375
At worst, it should
just be a little rusty

194
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,625
from sitting out
there all these years.

195
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,625
Dr. Brief said he'd find
it for me and fix it up!

196
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:29,250
And seeing as how he's as good
with technology as Bulma,

197
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,250
I'll bet it's
ready to go!

198
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
Heh, heh!
Good thinkin'!

199
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:35,500
Do me a favor, and tell
ChiChi not to worry about me.

200
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,291
Tell her I'm just going
to make sure Gohan

201
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,666
and the others
are all right.

202
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,291
They're gonna need some help
if that mystery person's

203
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,833
power level is anywhere near
as high as you say it is.

204
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,833
Tell her I'll be back
as soon as I can!

205
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,916
Flying Nimbus!

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,750
Well, wish me luck.

207
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:52,916
[DOCTOR stuttering]

208
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,833
[BOTH squealing]

209
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,791
[GOKU] See ya', guys!

210
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:01,708
[CHICHI humming]

211
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:06,750
What? That's Goku!
Just what in the world?!

212
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,958
Where do you think
you're going?!

213
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,125
You didn't even pack
clean underwear!

214
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,833
You know what he
is, don'tcha?

215
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,375
[ROSHI]
Hm? What's that?

216
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,916
[YAJIROBE]
Crazy, that's what!

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,458
He's not even out
of bed five minutes,

218
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,208
and he's already rushin'
off to another battle!

219
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,416
Goku's always loved
a good challenge.

220
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,333
And he's sworn to protect those
who can't protect themselves.

221
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,250
On top of that,
he's a Saiyan,

222
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,500
so the thirst for battle
is in his blood.

223
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,666
So, he's a Saiyan. Well,
that definitely explains it.

224
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,208
He's not just crazy.

225
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:49,708
He's crazy and he's
from another planet!

226
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,208
[thinking] I can't believe
there's another fighter

227
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:53,375
out there that's even
stronger than Vegeta!

228
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,666
I just hope Gohan and Krillin
can hold things together

229
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,125
'til I get to Namek!

230
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,333
Gohan, you're putting
out too much energy!

231
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
Keep it as
low as you can!

232
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,208
Right, got it.

233
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:49,125
[MRS. BRIEF singing happily]

234
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,083
Oh, Goku!

235
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,750
[giggles]

236
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,625
Sorry to
just drop in.

237
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:00,750
Don't mention it!
Are you feeling better?

238
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,291
Yeah. Strong as an ox.

239
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,333
So, does your husband have that
spaceship ready for me yet?

240
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,750
Oh, goodness, no.
Not even close.

241
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,000
But he's still
working on it.

242
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,458
Not even close?!

243
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,583
I mean, really?

244
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,208
[MRS. BRIEF] Tell you what.
Why don't we go check on him?

245
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,708
[GOKU] Oh, thanks.

246
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,041
[MRS. BRIEF] And
how's that adorable

247
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,291
little boy of yours doing?

248
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,375
I'm just dying to
finally meet him.

249
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,833
I bet he's getting to be
quite the looker. Handsome!

250
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,000
Just like his big,
strong father.

251
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
He's doing okay.

252
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,916
And, he's turning out to
be a heck of a fighter!

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
A chip off the old
block, huh?

254
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,791
And how is ChiChi?

255
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,916
I haven't seen her since
I don't know when.

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Shame on you, Goku!

257
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,458
You really need to come
visit more often! You know?

258
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:48,833
Yeah, well
I've been busy.

259
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,375
[MRS. BRIEF] Oh, sweetums!
Darling! Goku's here to see you!

260
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,375
Wow... I don't believe it.
So this is my ship, huh?

261
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:01,166
I didn't think it
would be so big!

262
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,208
[MRS. BRIEF] Honey!

263
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,708
[DR. BRIEF] Oh, Goku! You're
looking much better!

264
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,250
[GOKU] I'm all healed
and ready to go.

265
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,708
I was actually
wondering

266
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,750
if you were done with
my spaceship yet.

267
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,375
Still a few bugs to
work out. Come on in.

268
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:22,250
I'll be right back with
some refreshments, 'kay?

269
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,708
Oh, sure. Thank you!

270
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,458
Oh, wow!

271
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,791
It's huge!

272
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,541
I can't believe you did
all this! It's incredible!

273
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:36,958
Not really. Just hard work
and a bit of elbow grease.

274
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,291
It looks like it's got
everything I need.

275
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,750
Glad you like it.

276
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,875
But, I won't lie to you...
It wasn't an easy task.

277
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,250
Your old ship was
practically demolished!

278
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,000
I was able to salvage the
engine and a few key parts,

279
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,208
but otherwise I had to
build this from scratch!

280
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,166
But I thought my ship
would've been okay!

281
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,250
That's weird.
I must've smashed it

282
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,708
when I was a baby
or something.

283
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,125
Who knows? Anyway, I
installed everything

284
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,291
you asked for.
Even the training stuff.

285
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:10,125
Really? Wait, even the
artificial gravity machine?

286
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,625
Ha! She's right
over here.

287
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,416
[GOKU] Perfect!
So, how does it work?

288
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,291
Here's the knob
that controls

289
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,000
how much gravity
you're training under.

290
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,958
You can set it to go anywhere
from double to 100 times

291
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,250
the Earth's
natural gravity.

292
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,166
Be careful you don't end
up like a pancake, though.

293
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,416
Because that's exactly
what'll happen to you

294
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,666
if you set the machine
too high too soon.

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,791
This isn't a toy. So please,
use extreme caution.

296
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,833
Don't worry, I will.

297
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,166
But I'm gonna have to
do some heavy training

298
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,375
before I
get to Namek.

299
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,250
So, how much longer until
she's ready to fly?

300
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,375
She's ready now! Anywhere in
the universe you want to go.

301
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Ah! What?

302
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,500
[DR. BRIEF] And there's a full
kitchen down this way.

303
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,333
And to get to the bathroom,
you follow the green arrows.

304
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,875
[GOKU] Wait a second! I thought
you said it wasn't finished yet!

305
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,916
And that's the truth. It isn't
finished. Far from it.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,875
I haven't installed
the cappuccino machine yet.

307
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:07,875
What?! Are you kidding? I
don't care about cappuccino!

308
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,333
Well, you say that now,
but wait until you wake up

309
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,666
and you want a nice
warm breakfast beverage

310
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,333
to start your
day off right.

311
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,125
[GOKU whining]

312
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,375
But, there's no time!
I'm in a big hurry!

313
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,458
I've got to get to the
others right away! Really!

314
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,041
[DR. BRIEF] Just another day
or two. What's the rush?

315
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,375
[GOKU] We got a
call from Bulma

316
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,541
saying they need
my help on Namek!

317
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,041
[DR. BRIEF] Hmm...

318
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,666
C'mon! Just teach me how to
fly this thing so I can go!

319
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,208
Are you positive you're okay
without the cappuccino machine?

320
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,416
Uh-huh!

321
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,208
Well, all the data's
been entered already.

322
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,166
All you have to do
is push the button,

323
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,916
and you're
off to Namek.

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,041
You should arrive there in
under six days, give or take.

325
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,000
Six days! Great!

326
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,416
That means I can definitely get
there in time to help them out!

Hey! I heard
Goku was here!

329
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
Oh, sure! He's
out checking on

you wanna see him.

said it was this button.

[DR. BRIEF] Well, what do
you know? It actually works.

341
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,750
Sometimes I amaze
even myself.

342
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,833
Dr. Brief!
Where's Goku?

343
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:55,375
On his way to
Planet Namek.

344
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:00,250
[DR. BRIEF] Probably wishing
he had cappuccino already.

345
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,333
We're close. They
must be right up there

346
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,083
over that ridge, Gohan.
We should walk from here.

347
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,541
Okay!

348
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:19,250
[KRILLIN] Yeah, feel that?
It's really strong now.

349
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:22,250
C'mon, we'll get a
better look from up there.

350
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,708
[GOHAN] Right.

351
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,916
Keep really low
to the ground.

352
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,375
[GOHAN] Hmm.

353
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,166
Just our luck, we're
right in front of 'em!

354
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,208
Let's go around.

355
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,666
Right!

356
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,500
[GOHAN] Hey!
That looks just like

357
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,791
the spaceship
we came here in.

358
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,750
[KRILLIN] That's weird.
I thought they had a radar,

359
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,958
but it looks like
they're still searching...

360
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,916
And there's that guy in
the hover vehicle again.

361
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,166
He's definitely
the one in charge.

362
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,125
His power
level's massive!

363
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,833
Yeah, you're
not kidding.

364
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,833
Uh? Ahh!

365
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,250
Check it out! Take a
look at what those guys

366
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,541
have tucked under their arms!
It's the Dragon Balls!

367
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:26,708
I can't believe
the size of them.

368
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,000
Huh?

369
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,833
[FRIEZA]
What's wrong, Dodoria?

370
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,375
Does your scouter
indicate something?

371
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know. For a second,
I thought I detected

372
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:42,458
a very weak power level.
And then it just disappeared.

373
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,916
It's probably just a bird,
or a small rodent.

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,208
Nothing that should
cause us any alarm.

375
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:52,375
[GOHAN and KRILLIN whimpering]

376
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,625
[KRILLIN] We gotta be careful.

377
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,583
Cuz, if they spot us,
we're as good as dead!

378
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
[HENCHMAN] Lord Frieza,
we only found five of them.

379
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,666
We're bringing
them out now.

380
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,875
It looks like the others
ran off before we got here.

381
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,375
Let's get moving!

382
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:11,708
Believe me, you don't want to
make me come in after you!

383
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,791
Huh...?

384
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,166
They look just
like Piccolo!

385
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,750
Guess we found
the Nameks...

386
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
[FRIEZA chuckles]

387
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:49,250
It sure is dark out here.
Pretty lonely, too.

388
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,458
[GOKU] But I've got a
lot of work to do

389
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,041
if I wanna get my power level
up as high as Vegeta's.

390
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:59,125
I might as well go ahead
and start training now.

391
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:03,166
It's not like I have anything
better to do in this place.

392
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,125
Now, let's see...
I trained at 10 times gravity

393
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,791
on King Kai's planet.

394
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,083
So I should probably
start higher than that.

395
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:16,583
[GOKU] 'Kay... Gravitational
level set to...

396
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:18,041
Twenty.

397
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,583
[GOKU grunting]

398
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,166
Whoa!

399
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,958
[grunting continues]

400
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,125
Shoulda' tried 11.

401
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,833
[NARRATOR] Goku speeds
toward the Planet Namek

402
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,416
in an effort to
join his friends.

403
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,708
But with only six days
in which to train,

404
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,416
can he possibly prepare himself
for the terrible new foe

405
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,166
he will face
once he arrives?

406
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,416
The shadow of
Frieza looms large...

407
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,458
Next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
