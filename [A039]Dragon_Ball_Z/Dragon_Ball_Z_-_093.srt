1
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,791
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,750
Frieza was still
taking shots at Goku.

3
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,500
[NARRATOR] And though
it seemed Goku

4
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,166
was throwing his arms
up in defeat,

5
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,583
he was actually powering up
for the ultimate attack.

6
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,125
[NARRATOR] Taught by King Kai,
this attack called on

7
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,375
the entire Namek
solar system for help,

8
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,875
drawing its energy from every
living organism around.

9
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,958
[GOKU thinking] I know I
shouldn't use the Spirit Bomb.

10
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,750
Its force could wipe
out this entire planet...

11
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:02,041
[FRIEZA] Pity.
He tries so hard.

12
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,541
[NARRATOR] But in
all his arrogance,

13
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,541
Frieza hasn't realized the
danger of the incoming assault,

14
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,125
thinking the weakened
Goku is merely trying

15
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,000
to delay his own demise.

16
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,000
[KRILLIN gasps]

17
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,375
There... in the sky!

18
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,083
That's the Spirit Bomb!

19
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,083
[NARRATOR] With the fate of
the universe on the line,

20
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,666
could it be the last hope?

21
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,416
Find out, today!

22
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:41,125
[GOKU grunts weakly]

23
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:53,833
[weak grunting]

24
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,833
[GOKU grunts weakly]

25
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:57,541
[GOKU grunts weakly]

26
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,541
[thinking] What is he doing?

27
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:03,375
I can't figure him out.
Is he taking a break?

28
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,750
[GOKU thinking] I call upon the
trees and the water, the sun,

29
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,458
the moon and the stars,
the plants and the animals...

30
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,375
All living things...

31
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,708
Let me share your power!

32
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,750
[GINYU] Ribbit... Ribbit...

33
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,916
Tell me,
Mr. Frog,

34
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
how strong do you
think Goku really is?

35
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,250
I mean, I know he's
strong and everything,

36
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,083
and that he did learn
from Master Roshi

37
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,791
which does account
for something...

38
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:24,041
And when he was a kid,

39
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,833
he won every competition
he ever entered.

40
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,750
Goku beat every single person
that tried to take him on.

41
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,208
[GINYU groans]

42
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,125
Do you understand?!

43
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,583
[GINYU croaks]

44
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,291
I guess what I'm saying is
I hope Goku's strong enough

45
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,333
to beat that horrible alien.

46
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,333
Hey, you're a friend of
that freak, aren't you?!

47
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,833
[GINYU growls]

48
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,291
Well, you better tell
your buddy back there

49
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,333
that he better give up before
Goku decides to get serious!

50
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,375
And don't think
I didn't warn you!

51
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,041
[GINYU] Ribbit...

52
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,041
[BULMA] Get going!

53
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,708
You don't have
any time to waste!

54
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,625
Ah, man, look at it!

55
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,416
It gets bigger every second!

56
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,958
I've never seen
anything like it!

57
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,458
[GOHAN] Krillin, do you
think it will keep growing?

58
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:22,625
[KRILLIN] I'm not sure...

59
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,041
It all depends on
Goku's concentration.

60
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,208
[GOHAN] Ohh!

61
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,958
The ball's around
50 metres in diameter,

62
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,041
which means Goku must
be drawing energy

63
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
from other planets as well...

64
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:34,500
And if that's the case,
there's no telling how big

65
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,083
the Spirit Bomb will become!

66
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,708
Frieza doesn't seem to be
capable of detecting the attack.

67
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,041
So tell me what's taking
Goku so long to use it?

68
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,375
Probably because Goku
doesn't think it's big enough

69
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,083
to defeat Frieza...

70
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,125
At least that's the only
explanation I can think of.

71
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,916
[GOHAN] Oh, please hurry, Dad...

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,583
There isn't much time left!

73
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,916
[thinking] Stars in heaven,
give me more power!

74
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,500
One question,
my unworthy opponent:

75
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,750
What do you think you're doing?

76
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,291
Watering your garden?

77
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,916
An interesting way of
spending your last few minutes

78
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,041
before I annihilate you.

79
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,833
[GOKU growls]

80
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,875
[thinking] Drawing in enough
power is taking too long!

81
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,666
I just hope he holds off
for a few more minutes!

82
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,875
Recoome!

83
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,916
Burter!

84
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,125
Jeice!

85
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,125
Guldo!

86
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,916
[GINYU FORCE]
All of us together are...

87
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,291
the one and only Ginyu Force!

88
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,166
Well, I can see that
they're impressed!

89
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,500
[JEICE] I gotta admit our
fighting poses are awesome

90
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,000
no matter how many
times we do them!

91
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,750
Ohhhh!

92
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:43,833
By the looks of it this place
seems to be a real nice planet.

93
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,041
I think we should make it our
new fighting headquarters.

94
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,458
Now that sounds a plan!

95
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,375
And, using our
superior strength,

96
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,500
we, the Ginyu Force,
will conquer this planet!

97
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,375
Tien...

98
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,791
these guys are idiots!

99
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,125
You can say that again.
And If I'm not mistaken,

100
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,291
wasn't it the Ginyu Force that
took on Vegeta and got beat?

101
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,000
I think you're right!

102
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,125
So, you're friends
with Vegeta's, huh?

103
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,041
That makes things
a little clearer...

104
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,333
We're the Ginyu Force.

105
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:16,041
The most elite fighting
force in the universe.

106
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,708
Your friend Vegeta was
an insignificant worm

107
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,041
compared to us!

108
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,333
That's right!

109
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,416
We would have beaten
that monkey with one blow

110
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,166
except we ran into
a little bad luck!

111
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,458
[ALL] Hmph.

112
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,250
Yeah, but that's all
ancient history...

113
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:34,916
Besides, we are here now
and we like this place.

114
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,750
And we are going
to make it our home!

115
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,208
So why don't you make
like a hair and split!

116
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,083
Hey, just who do
you think you are?!

117
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,833
It's you who's going to leave!

118
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
[CHIAOTZU] Yeah, get lost!

119
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,708
[GULDO laughs]

120
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,791
Please, don't
make me laugh!

121

[GULDO laughs]

122
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,291
If they want to fight,

123
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,541
bring it on!

124
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,458
'Cause I believe we all
could use the exercise!

125
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,541
Ohhhh!

126
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,458
Wait a second...

127
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,958
Remember what our
fearless leader said?

128
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,958
"When on a new planet, make sure
that you test your powers first!

129
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,666
Because the
climate might affect

130
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,666
your ability to fight!"

131
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,375
You got a point
there, Recoome.

132
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,791
All right...

133
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,708

[YAMCHA] Why, you!

136
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,541
What do ya' think you're doing
blowing up King Kai's stuff?!

137
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,250
Now it's my turn!

Nicely done!

143

On a scale of one to
ten, definitely eleven!

145

[thinking] Amazing!

151
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,958
There's ten times
the gravity up here!

152
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,208
That's some power!

for the landscaping.

154

[KING KAI] What's
going on out here?!

158
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,958
We have company!

159

[KING KAI] Hmm...

160
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,000
I have no time
for intruders,

00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,958
so I suggest you leave!

And I suggest
you do it now!

like to come andplay with us?!

With your
limited powers,

be a very fair fight...

a joke, huh?

Well, then, why
don't you try me

172

and figure it out for yourself?

179
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,083
Frieza...!

180
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:24,416
[GOKU chuckles]

181
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,750
Why, you
insolent little...

182
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,208
[FRIEZA yells]

183
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,666
[GOKU grunts]

184
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,333
[GOKU groans]

185
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,958
Oh no! Frieza knows!

186
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:41,958
Don't think so!

187
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,416
Not yet...

188
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
What seems to
be the problem?

189
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:56,000
Or have you finally
decided to give up?

190
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,083
[GOKU chuckles weakly]

191
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:05,791
[FRIEZA growls]

192
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,708
How dare you ignore me!

193
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,708
[GOKU chuckles]

194
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,166
[FRIEZA snarls]

195
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:22,708
[blows landing,
GOKU grunting]

196
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,166
[GOKU grunts]

197
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,083
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN gasp]

198
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,541
[GOKU] Just... a little bit...

199
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,750
longer...

200
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
So, have you
had enough?

201
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,541
[GOKU chuckles]

202
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,333
[FRIEZA growls]

203
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:06,125
[blows landing,
GOKU grunts]

204
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,416
Goku's not
fighting back!

205
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,083
Dad, please! C'mon!

206
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,625
[PICCOLO growls]

207
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,208
Gohan! Krillin!

208
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,750
We have to surrender
our powers to Goku!

209
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,833
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?

210
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,750
[PICCOLO] Give me your hands!

211
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,208
[GOHAN] Here...

212
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,583
[blows landing,
GOKU grunts]

213
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,666
[GOKU grunts]

214
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:43,750
[GOKU laughs]

215
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,791
[GOKU] Could ya
lighten up a little bit?

216
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,958
You want me
to lighten up?

217
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,916
Well how about this?!

218
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,375
[GOKU gasps]

219
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:55,041
[GOKU screams]

220
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,083
[screaming continues]

221
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,000
[GOHAN gasps]

222
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:06,791
[PICCOLO] C'mon!

223
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,666
You've got to concentrate!

224
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,125
Concentrate!

225
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:33,625
There is one thing
that truly agitates me...

226
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:37,166
And this may sound strange...

227
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,375
I never could
quite understand

228
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,666
your pathetic Saiyan mind.

229
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,666
But that really
doesn't matter now.

230
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,458
I have no interest in your
trivial little thoughts.

231
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:50,583
I only want to rid myself
of you once and for all.

232
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:55,500
And after I'm all finished
"playing" with you...

233
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,625
I will take care
of your bratty son,

234
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,250
and then the Universe
will be rid of your kind!

235
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,250
Hah! Super Saiyan!

236
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,541
Don't make me laugh!

237
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,000
[FRIEZA giggles]

238
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,458
[FRIEZA gasps]

239
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,333
[FRIEZA] What's that...?

240
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,708
That's not the sun...

241
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,125
Need... more time...

242
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,916
Oh no!

243
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,958
What is that up there?!

244
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,791
It's some kind of
enormous ball of energy...

245
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,166
HUH?!

246
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,000
[thinking] He created it!

247
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,791
[PICCOLO] That should do it!

248
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,541
We don't want to give up
all our energy...

249
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,291
Frieza knows about
Goku's attack...

250
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,000
Gohan!

251
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:56,958
Krillin!

252
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,708
You stay put and don't move!

253
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,208
I've got some unfinished
business to take care of!

254
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,541
[FRIEZA] So that's what he's
been up to all this time!

255
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,041
Collecting energy
into one giant ball!

256
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,375
But where did he
get so much power?!

257
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,500
[thinking] Okay, Frieza,
turn and run for it!

258
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,875
C'mon, get moving
before I use it!

259
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
Oh no, he's not taking the bait!

260
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,333
He must know it's
not strong enough yet!

261
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, man...

262
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:20,250
Oh, I get it.

263
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,958
That ball is your idea
of a clever diversion.

264
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,958
Well I hate to ruin
your little "game",

265
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:28,208
but your trump card
won't work on me!

266
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,833
[FRIEZA laughs]

267
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:34,500
[GOKU growls]

268
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,625
Say good night...

269
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
[GOKU gasps]

270
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,625
[PICCOLO thinking] Oh no!

271
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,750
Ka-boom.

272
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,833
Huh--

273
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,291
[FRIEZA grunts]

274
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,000
Piccolo?!

275
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,166
Goku...

276
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,750
You must hurry and
finish collecting energy

277
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,041
for your attack!

278
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,708
Yeah, you got it!

279
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,666
[GOKU growls]

280
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,583
[PICCOLO] C'mon you've
got to hurry up!

281
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,750
That attack used up all the
power I had left in me!

282
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,125
[GOKU] I'm trying!

283
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,875
[FRIEZA growls]

284
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,666
I spy with my
little eye...

285
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,250
one pitiable Namek who got away!

286
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:05,083
I think it's time to exterminate
this chubby little insect, huh?

287
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:06,875
[GINYU FORCE] Yeah!

288
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,666
Wait!

289
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,583
All right, boys, show
them what you've got!

290
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:17,875
What d'ya mean by that?!

291
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:36,208
Get ready for
a real fight!

292
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,250
Tien...

293
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,041
[NARRATOR] Is there time for
Goku to gather enough energy

294
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:45,833
for his Spirit Bomb Attack?

295
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,541
Or will Frieza stop
our hero in his tracks?

296
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,083
Find out on the next
exciting episode...

297
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:53,125
of Dragon Ball Z!
