1
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,375
Think again!

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,458
[NARRATOR] After a long
and grueling battle,

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,875
Vegeta was
finally defeated.

5
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:25,333
But, at Goku's request,
he was allowed to escape.

6
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:27,625
The Saiyan Prince
promised that one day,

7
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,458
he would return
for his revenge...

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,791
[NARRATOR] Though the day
had been won,

9
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,000
it wasn't without
its casualties.

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,708
As his fallen friends were
gathered from the battlefield,

11
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,875
Krillin thought of a way
to wish them back...

12
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,041
The Namekian
Dragon Balls!

13
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,875
Yeah, that's
a great idea!

14
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,250
And if Piccolo comes back,
then so will Kami!

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,000
And that means we'll have
all the Dragon Balls

16
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,083
on Earth back
here again, too!

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:53,500
Oh, it's that easy.
Well, I've got news for you!

18
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,125
I've done all the calculations,
and the numbers don't lie!

19
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,708
Your little cruise
to Planet Namek

20
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:02,500
is going to
take 4339 years!

21
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,666
Okay. But,
hypothetically speaking,

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,125
what would happen if we used,
say, a Saiyan spaceship?

23
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,541
[laughter]

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,333
[NARRATOR] So now, with a new
plan and restored hope,

25
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,666
Bulma, Krillin
and the others

26
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,916
prepare for the voyage
to the Planet Namek.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,833
The quest begins today,
on Dragon Ball Z!

28
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,833
[INVESTIGATOR] Come on! Let's
get this thing outta here!

29
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,833
The sooner we do, the
sooner we can go home!

30
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:59,375
[GOKU screaming]

31
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,458
[KRILLIN whimpering]

32
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:08,083
[GOHAN whimpering]

33
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,458
Gohan, you've got to catch
up on your homework!

34
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,625
Keep studying!

35
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:21,625
[GOKU screaming]

36
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,000
[KRILLIN whimpering]

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,458
Why are you shaking
like that, Krillin?

38
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,041
Uh, because I'm cold!

39
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:40,166
[DOCTOR] Stop squirming! You're
only making it take longer!

40
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,208
All we're doing is
changing the bandages.

41
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,708
What is this
guy's problem anyway?

42
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,916
[GOKU screaming]

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,791
I just can't
take it anymore!

44
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,416
I've got to
do something!

45
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,541
I'm gonna find that
Saiyan spaceship!

46
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,500
Just leave that to Bulma.
You need your rest, Krillin!

47
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,541
Yeah, but...

48
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,708
Vegeta could return to attack
the Earth at any time.

49
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,500
You boys need to be
healthy and ready!

50
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,333
You just leave my little
Gohan out of this!

51
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,958
His fighting
days are over!

52
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
Next patient, please...

53
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,291
Don't worry about me!
I think I've recovered!

54
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,625
Me, too!

55
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,625
[CHICHI and ROSHI growling]

56
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,208
[KRILLIN] See ya!

57
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,083
[ROSHI] Oh, no you don't!

58
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:24,916
[CHICHI] Get back here!

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,875
[CHICHI] You've got to let
the doctor check you over!

60
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,875
[laughing]

61
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:40,250
Yeah... But the good news is
there's no serious injuries

62
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,750
and we'll be outta
here in no time!

63
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,166
Ohhh... Lucky you, but I
think I'm going to be stuck

64
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,083
in this contraption
for a good while...

65
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,291
But the worst
thing is,

66
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,375
this is going to slow
down my training...

67
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,875
Don't you worry, Goku.

68
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,166
I'll see if I can
grow some Senzu Beans

69
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,916
to help speed your
recovery up a bit.

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Heh, heh. Hey Goku, you should
have seen Yajirobe fight...

71
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,916
Well, I didn't see you guys
doing any better...

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,458
It's hard to see
when you're hiding...

73
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:13,541
Yeah, he really showed
Vegeta. He was so brave...

74
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,833
I wasn't trying
to hurt you!

75
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,750
I was just playing around!

76
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,166
Ha... Nice one!

77
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,500
Heh, heh, heh. It was strategy!
I was distracting him!

78
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,375
[ALL laughing]

79
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,250
Well, I'm just so
glad that everyone here's

80
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,750
going to be
all right!

81
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,083
But I just hope that real soon
we can say the same thing

82
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:35,416
about all of
our friends...

83
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,708
Heh. We just gotta get the
Namekian Dragon Balls.

84
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,416
They'll be fine.
You'll see...

85
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,583
Hey, guys! Quick!
Turn on the TV!

86
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:55,166
Oh, it's Bulma! I thought
it was a hot new nurse!

87
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,875
Can't you be serious
for a change?

88
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,166
[ROSHI]
I was serious!

89
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,500
I am now standing in front
of the alien spacecraft

90
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,166
that was recovered
from the ruins

91
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,250
of East City
late last night!

92
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,958
For our safety,
it has been placed

93
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,583
inside this
isolation chamber!

94
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,000
The Saiyan
spaceship!

95
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:12,791
Right!

96
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,208
[GOKU] I can't see!

97
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,708
[MALE REPORTER]
Eyewitnesses at the scene

98
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,625
reported a second spacecraft
that mysteriously lifted off

99
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,791
and flew away during the
recovery operation...

100
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,458
What do we do now?

101
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,791
They've got that ship
under lock and key!

102
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,708
But, we need it!

103
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,541
And we'll
have it...

104
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,916
I'll fly it
out of there

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,208
using this remote control
that Vegeta left behind!

106
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,666
We'll be on
Namek in no time!

107
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,083
You know how that
thing works?

108
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,750
You've gotta be kidding me!
I can work anything!

109
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll just take this and aim
it at the TV... No sweat!

110
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,416
[BULMA] It's just like something
my dad would make!

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,708
All I have to do is punch
in a few coordinates...

112
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,791
Here, these ought
to do nicely...

113
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,375
And then...
We watch...

114
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:01,916
[beeping]

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,208
[GOKU] Watch what?

116
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,416
I can't see anything!
What's going on?

117
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,541
[REPORTER screaming]

118
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:15,958
The spaceship
has exploded!

119
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,333
It powered up and went
into some sort of

120
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,708
self-destruct mode!

121
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,833
The building around
me is in shambles!

122
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,375
[BULMA] Wait!
It can't be! Nooo!

123
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,833
[screaming]

124
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:32,291
What happened? How could
it just blow up like that?

125
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,250
The remote was supposed to
bring it here, not destroy it!

126
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,000
Now what are we
supposed to do?!

127
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,875
We'll never make it to
Namek now! Never! Never!

128
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,916
Sure seems that way...

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,875
Good job with that
remote, Bulma...

130
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,833
[KRILLIN whimpering]

131
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,333
[BULMA]
C'mon, think, Bulma!

132
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,666
There's got to be
another way...

133
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,083
Just calm down...

134
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,833
I'm sure that we can come
up with something, Bulma.

00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:08,458
[BULMA growling]

136
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,958
If we don't do
something soon,

137
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,875
we'll never get
our friends back!

138
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,458
Maybe we should ask Mr. Popo
and see what he thinks...

139
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,958
Mr. Popo?

140
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:18,791
Hello.

146
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,750
Did I hear that you are
looking for a spaceship?

[ALL gasping]

148
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:43,166
Yeah, why do you ask?
You don't have one, do you?

149
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,125
Maybe...

150
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,166
Uhh...

151
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,333
Who's that guy?

152
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:48,833
That's Mr. Popo...

153
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:50,833
Mr. Popo?

154
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,625
Yeah, that's right,
Mr. Popo.

155
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,541
He lives with Kami at The
Lookout, high above the Earth.

156
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:59,083
He and Kami have watched
over this planet for years.

157
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,458
Ooohhh!

158
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,750
So, where's this other
spaceship, then?

159
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,958
If it's a spaceship... I'm
not quite sure what it is...

160
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,958
But, I... I know that it's
not from this planet...

161
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:15,041
If it would help, I could
take one of you with me

162
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,500
and show you
where it is...

163
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,083
Hey, Bulma!

164
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,333
Uh, me?

165
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:26,250
Well, Bulma, you are the only
spaceship expert around here.

00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,333
I... I can't do it...

169
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,791

gives me the creeps.

[ROSHI] Careful, Bulma!
Here! Let me help you...

176
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,333
[BULMA] Hmm?

177
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,958
[PATIENTS gasping]

178
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,666
[BULMA[ Aaahh! Get me off
this thing! Somebody help me!

179
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,166
I'm too young
and pretty to die!

180
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,875
[BULMA screaming]

181
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,333
Huh?

182
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,750
Uhh?

183
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,708
[CROWD murmuring]

184
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,958
Good luck, Bulma!

185
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,583
Take it easy, okay?

186
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,458
I mean, I've never ridden
on a flying carpet before.

187
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,333
Yes, alright...

188
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,500
[BULMA] I just hope all
this is worth it...

189
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,958
They... They
just... vanished!

190
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:25,291
I sure hope Popo's right...
We really need a spaceship!

191
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,541
We're here.

192
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,333
Huh? We are?

193
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,875
[BULMA] Are you sure
this is the place?

194
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,958
I mean, there's
nothing here!

195
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:03,125
[MR. POPO] Don't be so
certain... You'll see.

196
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:12,416
What's wrong?

197
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,041
I'm freezing!
Just where are we?

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,541
Yunzabit Heights.

199
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:26,250
Yunzabit? But how? That's on
the other side of the world!

200
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,375
[MR. POPO]
Follow me... This way...

201
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,583
Hey! Wait up!

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,125
So, where exactly is
this spaceship, anyway?

203
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,333
Boy, you don't
talk much, do you?

204
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,041
[BULMA] Hrrm...

205
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,541
[BULMA] Ah.

206
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,666
I'm beginning to
think you're lost!

207
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,416
We walked all
the way down here

208
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,250
and now there's nowhere
left for us to go!

209
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,041
It's a dead end!

210
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,291
Wait! Stop!

211
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,708
What now?

212
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,333
I'm no rabbit!
How am I supposed...

213
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,333
[MR. POPO]
Climb, I guess...

214
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,958
There it is!

215
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,916
[BULMA gasps]

216
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,791
What do you think?

217
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,916
It's a ship,
alright...

218
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:11,458
What is this? It's not
metal... How weird...

219
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,041
All right!
I've had it!

220
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:15,500
What exactly do you
know about this thing?

221
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,791
Well, I only know what
Kami told me about it

222
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,416
from the stories of when
he was very young...

223
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,958
It's hard
to remember...

224
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:32,083
The last time he mentioned
it was over 100 years ago,

225
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,250
but I'll do my best
to recall what I can...

226
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,416
One day, not too
long after lunch,

227
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,291
Kami began telling me about
his mysterious past...

228
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,833
You see, Mr. Popo,
when I was a child,

229
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,291
I used to live in a place
called Yunzabit Heights.

230
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,291
It was very
cold and lonely...

231
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,125
Why would you
live there?

232
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,583
I'm not sure... I was
in a strange accident

233
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,166
and somehow
lost my memory...

234
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,333
How awful...
Then what happened next?

235
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,500
He told me that
he remained here,

236
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,166
waiting for his
parents to return...

237
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,250
Staring out into
the distant skies...

238
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,791
[KAMI] I was certain
that someone

239
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,333
would come
looking for me...

240
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,458
I thought that if I wandered
too far from where I awoke,

241
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,333
no one would be
able to find me.

242
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,916
So there I stayed,

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,125
patiently awaiting the
arrival of my salvation...

244
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,458
But my light of hope
grew more and more dim

245
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,125
as the days
passed me by...

246
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,500
Days led into weeks,
weeks led into months,

247
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,500
and months
led to years...

248
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:37,416
Finally, after more years
than I care to remember,

249
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,708
I left Yunzabit
Heights behind me...

250
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,583
Sometimes I would
return there,

251
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,500
but I never found any
sign of my people...

252
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:48,416
Sad, but what does your story
have to do with this ship?

253
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,666
Because during his time
here, he found this ship.

254
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,291
One day, I discovered 
something very strange...

255
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,458
It was round
and had four legs.

256
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,708
It looked like some kind
of giant alien insect...

257
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,458
As I examined the
strange sphere...

258
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,041
a word seemed to
appear in my head...

259
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,708
I found that if I spoke this
word aloud, a door would open.

260
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:15,083
Pic-co-lo...

261
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,791
What in
the world?

262
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,875
What are you
waiting for? Go.

263
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,916
So how do we
get up there?

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,625
You just say the
word again... Piccolo!

265
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,291
[BULMA] Wow...
Look at this place!

266
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,208
If this is some
sort of spaceship,

267
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,791
then how did
it get here?

268
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,833
I got it!
Kami was a Namekian!

269
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,125
King Kai told us
that a long time ago,

270
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:14,583
Planet Namek was in great
danger of being destroyed...

271
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:18,083
Yes, I believe I've heard
that story before as well!

272
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,166
They thought their
planet was done for,

273
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,500
so they started
evacuating everyone

274
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:24,583
on Namek to
other worlds!

275
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:27,333
If this ship really is
from the Planet Namek...

276
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,000
It kinda makes everything
fall into place!

277
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,416
When their planet
was in danger,

278
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,291
Kami's parents must have
put him on board and

279
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:36,916
sent him here to
save his life...

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,041
I'm sure they intended
to join him here later

281
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,166
but for some reason,
something happened

282
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,041
and they never made it...
The poor little fella...

283
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,333
Popo! If we can just get
this old thing working,

284
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,333
then maybe we can...
Hey, wait a minute!

285
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,500
If the door opened,
it is working!

286
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:59,333
But I don't know how
these controls work...

287
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:00,708
It's alien technology,

288
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,041
so I don't even know
where to start...

289
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,750
Well, uh,
when in doubt...

290
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,875
Just start pressing
some buttons...

291
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,750
[BULMA growling]

292
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,750
It's no use...
It... It won't work!

293
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:19,166
It must be
missing something...

294
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,833
Spaceship Expert...
Yeah, whatever!

295
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,250
I don't have the faintest
idea what I'm doing!

296
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,666
But I've got to keep trying.
Everyone's counting on me!

297
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,958
Man, I really hope they've
found that spaceship...

298
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,958
[ROSHI] If it's
a spaceship...

299
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,041
[ROSHI sighs]

300
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,166
[GOKU thinking] Please,
Bulma... Hurry!

301
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,208
[BULMA] Move,
you hunk of junk!

302
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,916
What will I
say to everyone?

303
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,291
Hmm?!

304
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,333
What is it?

305
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,291
It's what we say
that makes it work!

306
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,625
I don't think
I understand...

307
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,583
It must be run by
voice command,

308
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,958
just like before when you
opened the entry hatch.

309
00:19:57,041 --> 00:20:00,500
But, that would mean all of
the commands are in Namekian!

310
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,750
[BULMA screaming furiously]

311
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:08,041
That's just great! Unless you
speak Namekian, we're stuck...

312
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:11,875
Wait a minute.

313
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,791
I'm pretty sure I remember
hearing some Namekian

314
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:17,416
back at the World
Martial Arts Tournament.

315
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,125
Did you really think
you could fool me

316
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,500
with that fragile
disguise?

317
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,166
Your skills
have improved!

318
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,208
But I don't remember
it enough to speak it...

319
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,125
Well, I don't speak
the entire language,

320
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,958
but I think I know
a word or two...

321
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,125
You do?

322
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,041
Sometimes Kami would
mix in strange words

323
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,166
when he would
speak to me.

324
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,125
I learned their meanings
by what context

325
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,416
he would
say them in.

326
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,625
Well, let's
try some of them!

327
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,166
If we can just figure out
one or two simple commands,

328
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,291
we'll be out of this
place in no time!

329
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,333
Can you think of any words that
might make this thing move?

330
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,791
[MR. POPO]
I can say fly.

331
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's try it...

332
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,708
See if you can tell it
to fly us to Jupiter.

333
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,166
Topurukuppa Jupe!

334
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,958
[BULMA] Something's happening!

335
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:02,875
[MR. POPO] What's that sound?

336
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,291
[COMPUTER]
Topurukuppa Jupe.

337
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:09,000

338
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,166
[whimpering continues]

339
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,791
Just hang on! We don't
have any safety belts!

340
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:29,583
[beeps]

341
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:30,750
[COMPUTER]
Sefte Bette.

342
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,250
Just what in the
world is that?

343
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,916
A toilet! You asked
for one in Namekian!

344
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,000
That's what sefte
bette means!

345
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:47,333
I didn't say that! I just
need a chair to buckle into!

346
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:48,791
[COMPUTER]
