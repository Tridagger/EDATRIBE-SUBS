00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,958
You're looking a tad green.

179
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,666
Go away! I always
look like this.

Now, girls, I have to go!

get a good picture of him...

184

[KRILLIN] Sorry for the wait!

190
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,166
[GOKU] No problem, guys!

191

Goten and I were just
having some play time.

192
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,166
So, let's go!

[KRILLIN] Now this is a crowd.

200
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,375
[GOHAN] Are all these
people competing?!

201
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:58,458
[VEGETA] I say we
wipe them all out now.

202
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,375
[ANNOUNCER] Huh?! Is that...?

203
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,166
Yeah! It's you!

204
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,333
[GOKU &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?

205
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,500
--Oh, hi!
--Hey!

206
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
[ANNOUNCER] Wow. And
here I'd started to think

207
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,000
that I'd never see
you guys again.

208
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,625
I mean, how long's it been?

209
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,833
You haven't come out to compete
in the World Tournament in ages!

210
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,250
But hey, tell me something,

211
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:21,041
it wasn't Mr. Satan
who beat Cell, right?

212
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,000
C'mon, I know it was you!

213
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,333
[GOKU &amp; KRILLIN chuckle]

214
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,000
Listen, I can't tell you
how glad I am you're here.

215
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,708
Without you, these last few
tournaments have been nothing

216
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,208
but Capital-B Bo-ring!

Huh...?

218
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,250
Say, are all of
them with you too?

219
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,166
[GOKU] Yeah, you could say that.

220
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,375
Great! Even better!

221
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,625
So, you think you guys
can get through the fights

222
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,708
without blowing up
the ring this time?

223
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,666
We'll try.

224
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,875
And that's exactly
the kind of attitude

225
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,666
this tournament
has been lacking!

226
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,833
Ha-ha!

227
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,250
You haven't...

always had that gold ring
over your head, have you?

229
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,416
Well, actually I've been dead
ever since my fight with Cell,

230
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,208
but they let me come back this
one time for a day to compete.

231
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,916
Uh... Uhhh...

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,541
Well, that's weird! But, hey,
with all the things

233
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,083
I've seen you do, it'd be dumb
to start doubting you now

234
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,375
am I right, Goku, baby?

235
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,708
[thinking] Good.

236
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,291
At least one person knows
how great my dad is...

Tournament now begin!

One hundred and ninety-four
people have entered

the adult tournament.

264
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,625
Unfortunately, there
are only sixteen spots.

265
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,708
And by the rules, the defending
champion, Mr. Satan,

266
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,458
is automatically qualified.

267
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:41,791
If you do the math,
that leaves fifteen spots!

268
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,208
So, here's the deal...

269
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,333

with Mister Saiyaman!

we'll select the finalists

by way of punching strength.

highest scores on the machine

277

back any of your strength

Okay... Ninety-seven points!

353
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,291
[FIGHTER E grunts]

354
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,291
[PRELIM REF] Number sixteen...
Seventy-seven points!

355
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,500
[GIRL] Good luck, Videl.
We're rooting for you!

356
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,958
[VIDEL grunts]

357
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:35,291
[FIGHTER F growls]

358
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:39,625
[PRELIM REF] Ooh! Very nice!
One hundred and twelve points!

359
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,083
How absurd!

360
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,041
Next, please! Number eighteen!

361
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,333
Lookie there! That girl's
pretty cute for a fighter!

362
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,583
Yeah! But I bet
she scores a thirteen!

363
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,666
[KRILLIN] Now, 18,
remember to take it easy!

364
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,125
[ANDROID 18] I know.

365
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,625
Seven hundred
and seventy-four?!

366
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,250
[gasping]

367
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,416
Wha...?

368
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,791
It seems to be out of order...

369
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,291
Sorry about that...

370
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,541
That's what you call
taking it easy?!

371
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,875
It's not my fault these
guys are weaklings...

372
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay, ma'am, would
you like to try again?

373
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,791
[gasping]

374
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,750
Two hundred and... three?

375
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:46,291
One hundred... and...
ninety-two points...

376
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,750
[gasping]

377
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,875
[gasping]

378
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:55,000
[PRELIM REF] One hundred...
and eighty-six points?

379
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,541
[gasping]

380
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,125
[PRELIM REF] Two hundred
and ten points?!

381
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:06,375
The pressure mechanism
seems to be broken...

382
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,166
See if you could fetch
the other machine?

383
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,625
[MONK E] Of course, sir...

384
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,166
[VEGETA] Now stand aside!

385
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,791
[PRELIM REF gasps]

386
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,416
[yelling]

387
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,291
Oh, wow...

388
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:26,958
[GOKU sighs]

389
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:30,166
So much for restraining...

390
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,708
[VIDEL whimpers]

391
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,541
[NARRATOR] It's safe to say
Vegeta and the other Z Fighters

392
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:36,625
have qualified for
the tournament,

393
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,458
in addition to destroying
a punching machine,

394
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,166
a dozen cameras,

395
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,625
and the speaking ability of a
couple hundred fighters.

396
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:49,708
Stay tuned for more
mayhem on Dragon Ball Z.
