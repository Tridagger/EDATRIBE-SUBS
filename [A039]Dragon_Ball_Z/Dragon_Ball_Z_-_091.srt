00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,333
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:20,583
Frieza kept dishing out blows
against our hero Goku

3
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,416
and Goku got all choked
up when Frieza revealed

4
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,958
he'd only been using 1%
of his actual strength.

5
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,666
In other words, Frieza's still
got a few tricks up his sleeve.

6
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,000
[FRIEZA] You should strike.
Why not, my back's turned.

7
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,083
What's wrong?

8
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,625
Don't tell me the
great Super Saiyan

9
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,916
is throwing in
the towel already.

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,458
What a disappointment.

11
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,750
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
back at King Kai's place,

12
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,791
Tien said not to sweat it.

13
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,375
Because Goku had a
surprise of his own:

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,875
The awesome Kaio-Ken Attack!

15
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,875
[NARRATOR] Unfortunately,
only King Kai knew

16
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,375
the disastrous truth...

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,583
Goku had been using
the Kaio-Ken all along!

18
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:03,000
And Frieza was still batting him
away like a pesky, little fly...

19
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,375
[KING KAI] And even if he
was 100 times stronger,

20
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,708
he would still be no
match for Frieza...

21
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,500
[NARRATOR] Can anything
stop the evil Frieza?

22
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,458
Find out today!

23
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,125

24
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,791
Huh?!

34
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,250
Huh...?

35

[GINYU laughing maniacally]

36
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,791
[GINYU] Just look
at those moves!

37
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,333
That kid's toast
against Frieza!

38
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,791
Oh, I'm going to enjoy this!

39
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,166
Huh?!

40
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,250
[high-pitched GINYU gasping]

41
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,666
[PICCOLO] Hey, who are you?

42
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,416
[high-pitched GINYU]
Oh, you mean me?

43
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,375
[BULMA] Ribbit! Ribbit!

44
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:49,666

00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,125
Uh...?

47
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,791
Change... now!

48
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:08,125
[GINYU chuckles]

49
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:14,333
So... this frog...
this frog must...

50
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:17,458
...must... be Bulma!

51

[BULMA croaking angrily]

52
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,000
[GINYU] It's payback time!

53

[KRILLIN grunting]

57
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,583
[GINYU] Aw, th-there's no way
I'm... going to beat 'em

58
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,958
with this body!

59
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,250
[GINYU stammers]

60
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
Now I got it!

61
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,333
I pick you!

62
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,708
Huh?!

63
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,583
Change... now!

64
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,166
Piccolo! Look out!

65
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,875
But... I...
I-I can't move!

[BULMA screams]

68
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,708
Then it's up to me!

71
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,666
Are... you okay, Piccolo?

[growling]

73
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,041

just happened, Gohan?

76

[BULMA] My... hands...

77
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,541
And both of my feet...

78
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,875
And my body...

79
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,083
Ouch!

80
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,958
I'm not a frog!

[BULMA giggles]

82
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:15,500
Ohh! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

83
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,375
I'm back to normal!

[BULMA laughs]

85
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,208
I'm really happy for
you Bulma, but this place,

86
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,916
it's not safe for a girl.

87
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,250

that's going on around--

pleeeeeaaaase!

Oh, please... Is that
the best you can do?

107
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,291
Where's the sport if
you don't fight back?

[GOKU gasps]

114
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,166
Wha... What an attack!

115
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,083
[FRIEZA] And I'm
just warming up.

116
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,291
I told you I could
destroy this planet

117
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,333
in the same way I
destroyed Planet Vegeta.

118
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,166
And please don't think me vain,

119
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,416
but are you impressed
by my handiwork?

120
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,958
No...

121
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:42,208
What if I can't...

122
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,750
...can't beat him...?

123
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:51,958
Wha...

124
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,458
What did Frieza just do?

125
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,083
He... He...

126
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,250
He split the planet
into two halves...

127
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,083
But what I can't figure
out is how come Goku

128
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,625
isn't even fighting
back against him?

129
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,916
Something isn't right here and
we've gotta find out what.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,083
[PICCOLO] Goku's just
realized the truth.

131
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:14,708
Regardless of how powerful
Goku thinks that he is,

132
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,583
Frieza is a hundred
times stronger

133
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,375
and Goku can't
defeat him!

134
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,333
I can do this
one of two ways.

135
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:50,541
Your end could be fast
or painfully slow.

136
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,375
Well, if you're not
going to answer,

137
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,666
maybe I'll make the
decision for you.

138
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,041
What's happening
down there, Tien?

139
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,541
It's not looking good.

140
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,291
From what I can make out,
Goku tried using his Kaio-Ken

141
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,500
but it wasn't enough
to overpower Frieza.

142
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,583
Isn't that right King Kai?

143
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,625
[KING KAI] Precisely!

144
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,833
And it seems Frieza hasn't even
shown half his strength yet...

145
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,000
No! It can't be!

146
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,791
Yes... I'm afraid it's
like I predicted...

147
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:51,541
Goku won't... win
against Frieza...

148
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,958
[KING KAI sobs]

149
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,916
[KING KAI] Goku can never win!

[KING KAI sobs]

151
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,000
[FRIEZA] My dear friend,

152
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,708
how can I make this even
more painful for you?

153
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,458
I could crush
your hands,

154
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,875
rip off both
of your ears,

155
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,750
or maybe I'll just smash in
your tiny little cranium.

156
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,625
[FRIEZA laughs]

157
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,625
You might be stronger,
a hundred times stronger

158
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:36,125
than me Frieza, and
you may have me down,

159
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:39,250
but I'm not about
to give up now!

160
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,375
[GOKU growls]

161
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:46,208
And, I will do whatever it
takes, even if it destroys me,

162
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,125
to finish you off
once and for all!

163
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:52,208
To give you what you deserve!

164
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,875
Your speeches
put me to sleep.

165
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,041
But, everyone has
to have last words...

166
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
[FRIEZA laughs]

167
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:04,416
[FRIEZA] Before they're shredded
into a million, little pieces...

[blows land,

169
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,791
[FRIEZA] Oh, what's wrong?

170
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,875
Poor baby got a boo-boo?

171
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, I'll make it better.

174
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:25,250
After all those
things you said,

175
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,708
I thought you hated me.

176
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,166
[GOKU] Huh...?

177
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,916
Well, I've really enjoyed
prepping you for death.
