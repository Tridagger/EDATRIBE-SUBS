1
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,583
[NARRATOR] The Androids have
picked themselves up a new van

3
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:25,500
and they're getting ready
to go for a little drive.

4
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,708
Their final destination:
Goku's house!

5
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,166
And if they have their way,

6
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,208
they'll see to it that Goku
is dead on their arrival!

7
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:36,666
[NARRATOR] However,
Piccolo might have something

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,875
to say about that.

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,208
He's returned to
Kami's Lookout in the hopes

10
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:43,000
of merging with the aging
Guardian of the Earth.

11
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:45,708
Once reunited,
these two powerful forces

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,875
will form a
single "Super Namek",

13
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,041
strong enough to stop
the Androids in their tracks!

14
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,375
Meanwhile, the gang
is moving Goku

15
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,750
to a safer location.

16
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,541
[YAMCHA] I think Goku
has packed on a few pounds.

17
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,833
[KRILLIN] Give him a break!

18
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,208
He hasn't been himself lately!

19
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,291
[NARRATOR] Can they keep
the ailing Goku hidden

20
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,541
from the Androids?

21
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,583
Find out today!

22
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,458
[ROSHI]
All right, Chiaotzu!

23
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,083
Let's see if
this soup of yours

24
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,541
passes the
"Master Roshi Taste Test"!

25
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,208
[OOLONG] Well it
smells good to me!

26
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,166
That's for sure!

27
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:30,583
[slurping]

28
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,625
[ROSHI] Not too bad...

29
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:37,625
[slurping]

30
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,833
[CHIAOTZU growls]

31
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,875
[slurping]

32
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,541
[CHIAOTZU]
Well, how is it?

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,750
Great!

34
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,416
[CHIAOTZU gasps]

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,375
[ROSHI] That was
delicious, Chiaotzu!

36
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,333
You really know how to
make a fine bowl of soup!

37
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:00,166
Thanks, Master Roshi!

38
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,666
[slurping]

39
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,875
[OOLONG] Mmm!

40
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,791
This might be the best
soup I've ever had!

41
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,500
Please tell me there's some
more where this came from!

42
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:11,500
I could go for a couple
helpings of seconds!

43
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,166
And maybe even
some thirds, too!

44
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,250
Where did you learn
to cook like that?

45
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,291
I used to cook for Tien
when he was training

46
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,000
and I came up with
a few of my own recipes...

47
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,250
Here's a thought!

48
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,750
Why don't you stay here
and train with us, Chiaotzu!

49
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,250
Huh?! Stay with you?

50
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,583
Sure, you could stay here
and train with all of us!

51
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,125
Train?! C'mon, admit it!

52
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,125
The only reason
you want him to stay

53
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,666
is so he'll cook for you!

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,875
[ROSHI] That's ridiculous!

55
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,625
I-I just thought it
would be nice if he--

56
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,958
[OOLONG] Nice if
he cooked for you!

57
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:02,416
[ROSHI] That's not true!

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,875
[OOLONG] Huh?

59
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,333
[CHIAOTZU] Tien!

60
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,500
[OOLONG] Oh... Hey there, Tien!

61
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,625
Chiaotzu... we're leaving.

62
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,916
Huh...?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,083
[TIEN] We have to get
back to our training.

64
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:21,041
Hey, wait a minute!

65
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,708
Fill us in, at least!

66
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,666
Were you able to take
care of those Androids?

67
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:29,333
Well, what then?!

68
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,916
What happened?! Tell us!

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,208
Tien? Is everyone okay?

70
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,458
Everyone's fine...

71
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,541
You don't have
to worry about them...

72
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,083
Krillin is on his way
here now with Goku

73
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,666
and he'll
explain everything.

74
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,333
They'll be safe with you...

75
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,750
No, wait!

76
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,750
You can't go!

77
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,625
[CHIAOTZU] Hey, wait up Tien!

78
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,583
I'd say something terrible
has happened out there!

79
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:55,041
[ROSHI growls]

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,458
[KRILLIN] Look at it
this way, Gohan.

81
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
It's all just a game
to these Androids.

82
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,583
And until they've found
Goku and destroyed him,

83
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,625
the game's not over.

84
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,041
Are they really
that powerful, Krillin?

85
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,333
[KRILLIN] Afraid so, bro.

86
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:12,500
They're even more powerful

87
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,666
than the Androids
Trunks told us about!

88
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,333
Huh...?

89
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,166
[YAMCHA] But I thought
those were the Androids

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,250
Trunks told us about!

91
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,166
[TRUNKS]
No. They're different somehow.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,125
[CHICHI screams]

93
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:27,291
[ALL gasp]

94
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:30,416
Oh no! What in the
world was I thinking?!

95
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,250
We don't have
a minute to waste!

96
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,416
We've got to hurry!
Before it's too late!

97
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,125
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,583
[CHICHI grunts]

99
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:41,166
Well, let's hit
those books, Gohan!

100
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,958
[GOHAN gasps]

101
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,416
I can't study now!

102
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,208
Don't you dare
talk back to me!

103
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,708
Now go to it!

104
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,041
Wow, Gohan!

105
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,583
And I thought I had it rough!

106
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,750
Hey! What do we do now?!

107
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:57,333
Beats me, Yamcha.
I'm all outta ideas...

108
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,666
Well, maybe there's
something I can do to help.

109
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,125
[CHICHI growls]

110
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,458
[TRUNKS] I could travel to
the past in my time machine

111
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,875
and destroy the Androids

112
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,250
before Dr. Gero has
a chance to activate them!

113
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,750
It shouldn't be that hard

114
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,791
now that I know
where his laboratory is!

115
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:16,083
Hey, yeah! That's a great idea!

116
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,291
Hold on...

117
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,291
I don't think I like
the idea of you going

118
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,166
after the Androids
by yourself...

119
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,041
No...

120
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,666
What if something goes wrong?

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,166
Besides, didn't you once
say that your time capsule

122
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,125
only had enough energy
to make one more trip?

123
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,291
I mean, how would
you make it back home?

124
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,041
You could be trapped
in the past forever!

125
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,666
Maybe...

126
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,125
Hey, if you go
back to the past

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,916
and destroy the Androids
before Dr. Gero wakes them up,

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,708
what happens to the Androids
that are here in this time?

129
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,666
They wouldn't just
vanish, would they?

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,958
Because if changing
the past makes them vanish,

131
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,041
what happens to the re--?

132
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,916
Gohan, that's none
of your business.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,708
You mind your studies!

134
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,333
No! He's right!

135
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,333
What was I thinking?!

136
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,625
Huh...?

137
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,916
If I go back in time
and destroy the Androids,

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,375
I can only save
the future of that world!

139
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,666
But I can't change anything
that they've already done

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,083
once they've been activated!

141
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,000
Which means there's really
no point in me going back!

142
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,333
Can you try that in English?

143
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,791
Ah, alright... let's see...

144
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,916
You know how Goku is alive now

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,833
because of the medicine that
I brought back from the future?

146
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,458
Well, in the future world
that the medicine came from,

147
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,333
Goku didn't make it!

148
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,375
That's because I can only
change one reality, not both...

149
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,208
Huh?

150
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,875
In other words, there are
two realities out there.

151
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,750
In one of them Goku survives,
in the other, well...

152
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,083
Let's just say
he wasn't so lucky.

153
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,208
Let me try to understand this.

154
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,541
[KRILLIN] You're saying
that even if Goku

155
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,458
beats the Androids
in our world,

156
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,500
they'd still be alive in
your world of the future?

157
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:51,583
Boy, that sounds
like some kind

158
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,208
of a parallel
universe or something!

159
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,958
[TRUNKS] Exactly!

160
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:57,000
So then, why'd
you bother to come

161
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,208
back in the
first place, Trunks?

162
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:02,541
You just said you
couldn't change anything.

163
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,041
--Hm?
--Huh?

164
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,166
My mother...

165
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:18,125
You see, it was my mother's idea
to send me back to the past.

166
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,333
She didn't think
there was anything more

167
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,875
we could do to help
the people in our world...

168
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:27,666
But she knew there were
others we could help!

169
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,125
Maybe we can't change

170
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,625
what the Androids have
done to this world, Trunks,

171
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,875
but I think I know of a way
we can make a better world.

172
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,166
A peaceful world,
free of the Androids forever!

173
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,416
[TRUNKS] I agreed with my mother

174
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,916
that I should travel
back in time,

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,333
but I had my own reasons
for wanting to go.

176
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,750
I hoped that in the past,
with Goku's help,

177
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,625
I would find the Androids
had some weakness.

178
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
That way, I could
go back to the future,

179
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,250
and even though
I still wouldn't be able

180
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,166
to bring back all
those already gone,

181
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,916
I might be able to save
the people who are left!

[KRILLIN] Are you okay, man?

Ah... Sorry about that.

189
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,000
Anyway, I thought this whole
plan would work out perfectly,

190
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,625
except that
I didn't count on

191
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,791
there being such
major differences

192
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:50,333
between the timelines
of my world and this world.

193
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,000
I thought Goku's
heart problems

194
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,958
would come much
earlier than they did.

195
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,500
And I only thought there
would be two androids,

196
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:59,375
but instead there's three.

197
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,333

I wish I did!

208
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,291
I guess something...

209

changes when you travel
back from the future?

[CHICHI] Try not
to worry, Trunks.

If you hadn't come
when you did,

on the bright side
once in awhile, huh?

He did.

We will get there
faster if we fly.

You're right! That's
what I've been saying.

00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,041
Thank you.

355
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,166
[receiver plays music]

356
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,291
[BULMA] Krillin?! What's wrong?!
Is everyone alright?!

357
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,750
Talk to me!

358
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,375
I've been so worried.
Where are you calling from?

359
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,583
I've tried calling Gohan at
his house and there's no answer.

360
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,375
It just rings and rings.

361
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,083
By the way,
is my son there?

362
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,583
I-I mean Trunks?

363
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,458
You know, the one
from the future...?

364
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,541
Huh?

365
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah, ah, he's sitting
right behind me.

366
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:36,625
He is?!

367
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,416
Well then, put him on the line!

368
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,000
He can hear you on the speaker

369
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,333
so go ahead and say whatever
you need to say, Bulma!

370
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,250
[BULMA] Well, tell him
we received a call today

371
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,333
from this guy who lives out
in the middle of the country,

372
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,166
somewhere to the
west of here.

373
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,208
He claims he found
some sort of weird,

374
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,833
old abandoned vehicle
and wants to keep it.

375
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:55,416
But he doesn't know
how to fly the thing

376
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,375
so he phoned us and
asked us if we knew.

377
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,333
Yeah, go on...

378
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,625
He tried to explain what
kind of vehicle it was,

379
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:05,166
but he didn't make any sense.

380
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,333
Well, we didn't know for sure

381
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,083
if it was one of our
products or not,

382
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,916
but he swore to me that it had
"Capsule Corporation"

383
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,416
written right across it.

384
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,708
So we asked him to
send us a picture of it.

385
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:20,291
I couldn't believe my
eyes when I saw it!

386
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,166
It was a picture of the time
machine Trunks came in,

387
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,208
and I've got some
bad news for you:

388
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,208
It was a wreck!

389
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,375
Huh?!

390
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,583
B-But that can't be true!

391
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,666
Here, look! I put it up!

392
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,708
I put it back into its
capsule when I landed!

393
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:38,250
He says the time
machine's right here!

394
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,666
Seriously?

395
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,291
But then... well, the time
capsule in the picture...

396
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,208
It's the same... but I guess

397
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,375
it does look like it's been
sitting there for a while.

398
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,041
It's almost completely
overgrown with moss and stuff.

399
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,333
So exactly how
many time machines

400
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,000
did we make in the future?

401
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:55,083
H-How many?

402
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,458
Well, we barely
managed to make one.

403
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,291
[BULMA] What? That's strange.

404
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,791
I'm sure this is a time
machine in the picture.

405
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,750
But I want to make sure.

406
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,625
Hang on. I'll just send
you a copy of the photo

407
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,875
through the fax.

408
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,083
Trunks, I want you to
take a good look at it.

409
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,416
Here. Check it out.

410
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,875
Huh?!

411
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:27,833
That's my capsule!

412
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,583
There's no mistaking it, guys!

413
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:32,041
That's the one
I came back in!

414
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:33,458
Wait a second...

415
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,708
What's going on here?!

416
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:40,291
[NARRATOR] Is this in fact the
time capsule Trunks arrived in?

417
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,916
Or is someone playing a
cruel joke on our heroes?

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,541
There's only one
way to find out:

419
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,833
Tune in next time for
another exciting episode

420
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,666
of Dragonball Z!
