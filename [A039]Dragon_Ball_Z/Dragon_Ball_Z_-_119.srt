00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,208
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,416
a menacing force is
rapidly approaching.

3
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:25,458
[FRIEZA] There it is...
Planet Earth, dead ahead.

4
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:27,625
[GOHAN]
I feel it too! This isn't good!

5
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:30,458
[NARRATOR] A force that
greatly concerned Gohan.

6
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,625
[GOHAN] But who is it?

7
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:35,166
Dad, where are you?

8
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,125
[NARRATOR] The power seemed
to be felt by everyone on Earth.

9
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,125
[YAMCHA] Wait! How do you know?

10
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:45,666
I know! I make it my
business to know! Unlike you!

11
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,625
There's two of them, Chiaotzu!

12
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,958
My gosh! I've never
felt anything like it!

13
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,666
Tien, I'm scared!

14
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,500
[NARRATOR] Even King Kai
sensed the malevolent prescence.

15
00:02:55,583 --> 00:03:00,208
[KING KAI] I know, Bubbles,
yes! I can feel it too...

16
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,416
[NARRATOR] It's time for
our heroes to get ready,

17
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,583
because this danger is
worse than they think.

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,541
[CHICHI]
Oh no! Dad!

19
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,708
[GOHAN growls]

20
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,291
[NARRATOR]
Frieza's back!

21
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,750
And he's got his evil
eye set on Earth.

22
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,291
[GOHAN growls]

23
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,708
This can't be happening!

24
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,375
[GOHAN] If Frieza's
really on his way here,

25
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,375
then we're gonna need
all the help we can get!

26
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,708
Come on, Krillin.
Where are you?!

27
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,416
[KRILLIN]
Hey!

28
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,000
[GOHAN] Krillin!
A-Are you sure it's Frieza?

29
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,666
Are you sure it couldn't
be someone else?

30
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:03,541
No, Gohan, I can smell him!

31
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,541
I'll never forget that stench!

32
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,291
If you think that your
little friends can escape me,

33
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,166
you're sadly mistaken!

34
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,875
Krillin! Look out!

35
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,208
[KRILLIN gasps]

36
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,583
[KRILLIN wails]

37
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:22,083
This time you won't come back!

38
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:26,083
[KRILLIN whimpering]

39
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,750
[KRILLIN yelling]

40
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,083
Help me! Ah--!

41
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,083
[GOHAN]
I just can't figure it out!

42
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,750
I thought for sure my
dad finished off Frieza

43
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,541
once and for all!

44
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,208
So did I! But it looks
like we were both

45
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,958
wrong this time, Gohan.

46
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,541
[KING COLD]
Ah, yes!

47
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,541
I've always so enjoyed
the last few quiet moments

48
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,541
before laying a planet to waste.

49
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:08,208
But I must say, I'm feeling
almost as anxious as you

50
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,583
to reach our
destination, Frieza.

51
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,958
I'm quite curious
to meet this Saiyan!

52
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,000
After all, I've heard
so much about him,

53
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,875
one could hardly blame me.

54
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,333
[FRIEZA growls]

55
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,166
Seems something's got your
blood boiling. Yes, son?

56
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,458
Mm-mmm! We mustn't let our
tempers get the best of us.

57
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:46,083
[FRIEZA] You've got me
figured all wrong, Father,

58
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,083
I was just admiring the view!

59
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,708
It's simply
electrifying, I'd say!

60
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,291
[FRIEZA chuckles]

61
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,500
[YAMCHA] I can't believe
how fast Vegeta is!

62
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,416
I can hardly keep up with him!

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,250
[VEGETA thinking]
Perhaps Kakarot wasn't as strong

64
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:16,083
as I had imagined, after all!
Frieza's still alive!

65
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,166
And I can sense
that his power level

66
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,375
is even greater than before.
But I'll soon show him!

67
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,458
So is mine!

68
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,000
[CHIAOTZU] I don't like this,
Tien! They're coming!

69
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,291
I sense them!

70
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,750
[CHIAOTZU whimpers]

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,583
[SPACESHIP CAPTAIN]
We're in final approach

72
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,500
to Earth, your Excellency.

73
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,541
[KING COLD]
Very good.

74
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,875
This is the place where
he'll be touching down!

75
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,666
[YAMCHA]
Are you sure, Vegeta?

76
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,541
Yes, I'm sure! Now zip it!

77
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,333
I don't want him
to know we're waiting!

78
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,791
[YAMCHA growls]

79
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,750
[BULMA]
Hello down there!

80
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,375
[YAMCHA]
It's Bulma!

81
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:18,958
Vegeta! Yamcha! I'm coming in!

82
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,083
[PUAR giggling]

83
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,958
[PUAR] Yamcha!

84
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,916
[YAMCHA] What in the world
are you two doing here?!

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,666
We came to see Frieza!

86
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,875
I missed him on Namek

87
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,750
and I'm not going to
let that happen again!

88
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,500
Are you crazy?! Do you
realize what he'll do to you

89
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,958
when he finds you here?!

90
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,708
Yes, of course I do!

91
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,250
He'll come down
and blow up the planet

92
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,333
but I want to see
him before he does it.

93
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,666
What's so wrong with that?

94
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,916
Besides, I hear he's kinda cute!

95
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,000
[VEGETA] It's amazing how
every time you open your mouth

96
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:10,208
you prove you're an idiot!

97
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,166
[YAMCHA]
Huh?

98
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,916
Tien! Chiaotzu!

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,375
Huh?

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,583
[TIEN] Vegeta! I didn't realize
you were going to be here too!

101
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,625
Is that okay?

102
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,791
[TIEN]
As a matter of fact, it isn't!

103
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:30,083
I still haven't forgotten what
happened the last time we met!

104
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,875
You disgust me!

105
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,666
How can you stomach him, Yamcha?

106
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,708
Ha! Loser!

107
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,833
What?!

108
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,500
Hey, cool it, guys!

109
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,458
This is no time to fight, okay?

110
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,791
[TIEN growls]

111
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,583
[VEGETA] Hmph.

112
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,333
[YAMCHA sighs]

113
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:55,833
It's Frieza, isn't it?
How long 'til he lands?

114
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,500
Could be any time now...

115
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,666
Be quiet! I'd rather
Frieza's scouters didn't

116
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,541
detect us because of
your incessant jabbering!

117
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,458
Besides, all this scary talk
is upsetting the Namek.

118
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,750
[YAMCHA]
The Namek?

119
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,625
[ALL gasp]

120
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,291
[YAMCHA]
Piccolo!

121
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:15,375
How long have you
been standing there?

122
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,416
[PICCOLO] Long enough to hear
all of your senseless bickering!

123
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,208
Look, Gohan! Down there!

124
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,750
[GOHAN] Wow! It looks
like everybody's here!

125
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
[KRILLIN] Guess it's safe to say
we came to the right place!

126
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,166
Hey there!

127
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,958
Wow! Gohan! Krillin!
You made it!

128
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:40,750
Huh? Hey! Any word from Goku?

129
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,291
[BULMA laughing]

130
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,583
[BULMA sighs]

131
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:47,041
[PUAR sighs]

132
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,750
[YAMCHA]
I just thought I'd ask...

133
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,541
[PICCOLO gasps]
He's here!

134
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:04,250
[ALL gasping]

135
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:35,291
[ALL growling, gasping]

136
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,916
[KRILLIN] He's landing
just over that ridge!

137
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:48,000
[PUAR whimpering]

138
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:51,875
[BULMA sobbing]
[PUAR whimpering]

139
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:57,916
It's... like I dreamed!
Frieza! He's really here!

140
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,208
Gohan, try to focus,
bro. We need you!

141
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,208
[SPACESHIP CAPTAIN] Your
Excellency, the landing process

142
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,375
is complete. We have
reached our destination.

143
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,000
[KING COLD]
Superb!

144
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,458
[FRIEZA giggles]

145
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:42,791
[ALL gasping]

146
00:12:47,833 --> 00:13:01,000
[ALL gasping, grunting]

147
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,750
Now, there's no
room for mistakes!

148
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,500
We've all got to keep our
power levels suppressed

149
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,250
or else Frieza will pick
us up on his scouters.

150
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,833
Ready?

151
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,583
[YAMCHA]
This is crazy!

152
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,625
I've never felt
anything anywhere close

153
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,791
to the amount of power
I'm sensing right now!

154
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,666
I hate to say it,
Yamcha, but this is only

155
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,875
the tip of the iceberg!

156
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,708
There's no way we're
gonna last very long

157
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,833
against a massive
force like that!

158
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,333
Hey, you guys
are kidding, right?

159
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,250
I-I mean, you're not
suggesting that we attack him?

160
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:43,583
Like Tien said,
we'd all be wiped out!

161
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,416
I'm telling you,
Frieza's a monster!

162
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,250
And attacking him is suicide!

163
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,708
[PICCOLO]
But we have to try, Yamcha.

164
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,125
Unless we stop Frieza
right here and now,

165
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,458
you may as well kiss the
entire planet goodbye!

166
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,916
[YAMCHA whimpers]

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,291
[BOTH sigh]

168
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,416
[TIEN growls]

169
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,833
[VEGETA]
He's right, you know.

170
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:10,291
You really have no choice.
So what say we put an end

171
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:14,083
to all of this pathetic
whimpering and go find Frieza!

172
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,125
Before he finds us...

173
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,458
[FRIEZA]
So this is the planet Earth.

174
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:45,541
My, how very quaint!

175
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,875
[FRIEZA gasps]

176
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,166
[FRIEZA whimpering]

177
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,250
[FRIEZA growling]

178
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,875
[GOKU] It was enough
to beat you, Frieza.

179
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,958
Now, live with the shame. Keep
it bottled up inside, silently.

180
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,208
[FRIEZA grunts]

181
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,750
Poor, stupid Saiyan! You
honestly think you've won?

182
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,583
Your puny mind never
could understand.

183
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:31,416
I am Frieza, the most
powerful being in the universe!

184
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,708
And you are nothing
but a monkey!

185
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:42,000
[FRIEZA] You can't win.
Because I am mighty

186
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,416
and you are not.

187
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:52,250
Now learn!

188
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,291
Learn what happens
when you mess

189
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:58,583
with the most powerful
being in the universe!

190
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:03,041
[GOKU]
You fool!

191
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:11,125
[FRIEZA yelping]

192
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:22,000
[weakly]
Monkey! He was just a monkey!

193
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,375
[CAPTAIN BLUE] Sire, much as
we expected, the entire planet

194
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,291
Namek has been destroyed
by the explosion.

195
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,583
And, well, uh, all though
there seems to be no signs

196
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,000
of Lord Frieza just
yet, your highness,

197
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:51,750
we are continuing our
search among the debris

198
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,041
and we're very hopeful that--

199
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,291
Uh...

200
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,333
[KING COLD]
You disappoint me, Captain.

201
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,041
It seems you lack
confidence in Frieza's ability

202
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,250
to survive such a pitiful blast.

203
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:06,041
I tell you, my son is not so
easily destroyed as a planet.

204
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,916
He is out there, alive!

205
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,083
So, please do go and
find him, won't you?

206
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:17,625
[KING COLD chuckling]

207
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,916
[CAPTAIN BLUE gasping]

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
[CAPTAIN BLUE screams]

209
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,208
I've found him, Sire!

210
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,833
It's a very faint signal,
but we have locked on

211
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,833
to Lord Frieza's position!

212
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:38,583
[KING COLD] Excellent! Have him
brought on board immediately!

213
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,541
[KING COLD]
Status report, Doctor.

214
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,833
[DOCTOR] Your Highness, we
are working on Lord Frieza

215
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,916
around the clock,
and I am confident

216
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,708
that we can rebuild him!

217
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:06,958
We have the technology to
make him faster, stronger,

218
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:11,125
and in every way more
powerful than he was before!

219
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:14,333
Even as we speak, a team
of our brightest engineers

220
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:17,625
is working diligently to create
the cybernetic attachments,

221
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:20,708
we will need in order to
make Lord Frieza whole again!

222
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,708
[DOCTOR] Once these mechanical
enhancements have been made

223
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,833
to his existing body,
he will be able to realize

224
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,625
energy levels far greater
than ever before!

225
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,500
Levels that would have
been unsustainable

226
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,041
in his purely organic form!

227
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,333
Sire, I can whole heartedly
assure you that Lord Frieza

228
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:43,125
will soon reestablish himself
as the most powerful force

229
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,041
in the universe!

230
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,583
There!

231
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,625
[DOCTOR]
Not too quickly, my lord!

232
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,375
Set a course for Earth, Father!

233
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,583
[KING COLD] Planet Earth?
What ever for, my son?

234
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,541
I'd like to blow it up!

235
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,958
Change course!

236
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:22,291
[FRIEZA] I will make him
suffer for what he did to me!

237
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,791
I will make this
whole planet suffer!

238
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes, do be quick about it!
I'd rather not stay too long

239
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,041
on this pathetic
little mud ball!

240
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,083
Not that I don't
just love it here.

241
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,458
But I still don't see why
we can't simply destroy

242
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,041
the planet right now!

243
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:46,791
You can be absolutely naughty,
Father. It's impressive.

244
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,708
And here I've always
wondered where I picked up

245
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
my knack for it.

246
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,833
I take great pride in the
fact that I have taught you

247
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,541
all the necessary
skills of life.

248
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,083
Use them well.

249
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,291
[FRIEZA]
Indeed I will.

250
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,583
For it just so happens
that I have also learned

251
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,583
from you the fine
art of revenge.

252
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,708
Allow me to demonstrate
by vaporizing all

253
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,625
of the Saiyan's
friends, one by one.

254
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,916
[FRIEZA laughing]

255
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,125
And, my! Oh, my! Won't he be
surprised when he returns home

256
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,583
and finds no one here
to welcome him but me?!

257
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:32,166
[GOHAN grunts]

258
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,333
[YAMCHA thinking] Why me?
I mean, I just got wished back

259
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,750
and now I have to face Frieza?

260
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,750
[VEGETA grunts]

261
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,916
[YAMCHA] I-I don't think
I can do this, you guys!

262
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,500
[BOTH gasping]

263
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,958
[FRIEZA] Now all of you,
begin your search!

264
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:59,958
And when you find
them, show no mercy!

265
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,708
[SOLDIERS]
Yes, sir!

266
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,250
[FRIEZA, KING COLD gasp]

267
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,041
[SOLDIERS gasping]

268
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,083
[FRIEZA, KING COLD]
Hm...

269
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,625
Ah, so you must be Frieza!

270
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,000
[NARRATOR]
Who is this myterious stranger?

271
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,083
And does he really think
he has what it takes

272
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,208
to go head-to-head with Frieza?

273
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:54,333

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
