00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:19,333
A mysterious stranger named
Trunks arrived from the future

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,958
with a warning for
Goku and his friends.

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,833
In three years time, an evil
scientist named Dr. Gero

5
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,916
will unleash two deadly
androids upon the Earth.

6
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,833
And if events leading up to
the attack are not changed,

7
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,291
the consequences will be
tragic for all of them.

8
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,916
Trunks left to fight the two
deadly androids in his own time,

9
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,041
leaving Goku and the others to
prepare themselves for the peril

10
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,291
that most certainly lie ahead.

11
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,083
It will require long hours
of training and discipline

12
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,083
to get their bodies
into the fighting shape

13
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:52,375
necessary to defeat
this unseen lethal foe.

14
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,250
But that's nothing new
to someone like Vegeta.

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,083
While the others
look toward a future

16
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
that has already been written,

17
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,500
Goku faces the daunting
task of leading them all

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,541
on a quest to change
the fate of the world.

19
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:09,083
Will they be ready to meet this
new Android threat head on?

20
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:13,083
Can Goku prevent Trunks' dark
predictions from coming to pass?

21
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,458
Only time will tell,
on Dragon Ball Z!

Well, I'll show him
that he's not half

28

29
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,083

be just as tough as he is!

[PUAR] I guess this is
what they mean by taking it

33

[BOTH] Huh?

178
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,208
[PICCOLO laughs]

179
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:20,333
[GOKU laughs]

180
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:23,250
Hey, Gohan! You're way too slow!

181
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,666
[GOHAN grunts]

182
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,333
[GOHAN yells]

183
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,666
[GOHAN growls]

184
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,041
[GOKU thinking] That's my boy!

185
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:36,000
[GOHAN yells]

186
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:39,291
[BULMA] Is he going
to be alright, Daddy?

187
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,666
[DR. BRIEF] I hope so!

188
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,416
The only thing he hasn't
bruised is his eyebrows.

189
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,625
If he stays in bed for a week
or so he should be alright!

190
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,541
He's dodged the bullet again.

191
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:52,875
It's a miracle he survived
such a horrible accident.

192
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,416
Those Saiyans are
practically indestructible!

193
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,583
[MRS. BRIEF sobs]

194
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,125
[MRS. BRIEF] Poor Vegeta!

195
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,000
[MRS. BRIEF sobs]

196
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,125
Come on, Dear!
Let's let him rest.

197
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,958
[thinking] You Lunkhead...

198
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,833
[VEGETA] Kakarot...

199
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,583
I'll... get stronger,
Kakarot! I'll beat you!

200
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,041
[thinking]
He's having a bad dream.

201
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:26,750
[VEGETA growls]

202
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,000
[VEGETA gasps]

203
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,625
[VEGETA gasps]

204
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,041
[GOKU chuckles]

205
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,500
Kakarot!

206
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:10,666
[VEGETA growls]

207
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm stronger than you!

208
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,083
[VEGETA yells]

209
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,250
Hmm?

210
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,500
[VEGETA gasps]

211
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,958
It's you!

212
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:36,125
You're not a Saiyan!

213
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:38,625
[VEGETA growls]

214
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,083
[VEGETA gasps]

215
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,291
[VEGETA gasps]

216
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,083
[VEGETA shouts]

217
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,041
[VEGETA yells]

218
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,541
[VEGETA] I am the strongest!

219
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:15,041
[VEGETA yells]

220
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,333
[VEGETA growls]

221
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:19,541
[VEGETA yells]

222
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:30,041
They're too fast! I'll never
be able to catch up with them!

223
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:39,500
But I... I'm the one with
royal blood in my veins!

224
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,541
Father!

225
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,916
[KING VEGETA] Vegeta,
someday you will be

226
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,166
the strongest Saiyan
in the universe.

227
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,625
[VEGETA] Father?

228
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:03,375
[KING VEGETA] Those ships
are headed to distant galaxies.

229
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,291
From the day we are born,

230
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:10,041
we Saiyans are examined
for our power and leadership.

231
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,708
The weakest of our people
are sent to planets far away

232
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,958
where they face no
threat from our enemies!

233
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,125
Hmph!

234
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,250
Goodbye, pests!

235
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,666
Vegeta! You come from
a strong blood line

236
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,083
and you possess
the potential power

237
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,583
to join the super elite
of all Saiyans!

238
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,208
Never forget where you're from
and train very hard, my son!

239
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,000
Because if you have
proven yourself worthy,

240
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,666
perhaps someday you will
become a Super Saiyan!

241
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,416
[thinking] I haven't forgotten
what you said, Father!

242
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,625
I haven't forgotten my destiny!

243
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,458
And now I know that I will
be stronger than Kakarot!

244
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:53,166
[VEGETA] I am a Super Saiyan!

245
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,375
[VEGETA laughs]

246
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:57,833
[VEGETA gasps]

247
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,500
[VEGETA] What is she doing here?

248
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,083
[COMPUTER]
Initiate gravity simulation.

249
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:24,666
400 times planet's
normal gravity.

250
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,041
Warning.

251
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,041
Simulation exceeds human
biological tolerance levels.

252
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:39,083
[VEGETA grunts]

253
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:44,125
[VEGETA grunts]

254
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:53,416
[grunting continues]

255
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:04,208
[YAMCHA] Puar, It's time for
us to get back to work!

256
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,666
Yeah!

257
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,916
Stop it, Vegeta!

258
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,250
You are in no condition
to be doing this right now!

259
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:22,958
[BULMA] I know you don't
want to believe it,

260
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,833
but you are made
of flesh and blood!

261
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:31,666
Stop pestering me,
woman! Leave me alone!

262
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,416
[VEGETA yells]

263
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,250
You know I'm right!

264
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,875
So why don't you just
keep quiet and do as I say!

265
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,875
[VEGETA grunts]

266
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,375
Nothing to say?
Well, that's good!

267
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,291
Now go back to bed
and get some rest!

268
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,541
Not yet! I do have
something to say!

269
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:03,583
Huh? Uh... What?
Is something wrong?

270
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,666
Or maybe you're finally
going to apologize to me.

271
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,166
If that's the case,
then let's hear it!

272
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,583
LEAVE ME ALONE!

273
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,041
[BULMA gasps]

274
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:33,125
[blows landing,
grunting]

275
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,958
[NARRATOR] Goku and his friends
have only three short years

276
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:37,750
to prepare themselves
for the arrival

277
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,083
of Dr. Gero's evil androids.

278
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,666
And they plan to use
every minute of it!

279
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,541
But will these
powerful new enemies

280
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,750
still be too much
for them to handle?

281
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,208
Not if Vegeta has
anything to say about it.

282
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:53,708
On the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
