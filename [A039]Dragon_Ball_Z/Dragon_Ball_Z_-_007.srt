1
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,458
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,000
[KAMI] For this reason, we
humbly ask that you allow Goku

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,958
to seek training
from King Kai himself.

4
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,000
[YEMMA] Hmm... 

5
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,125
[NARRATOR]
With the help of Kami,

6
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,833
Goku was given
permission to receive

7
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,541
King Kai's
special training.

8
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,500
But in order to reach this
legendary fighting master,

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,208
Goku must first
travel the length

10
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,958
of the treacherous
Snake Way!

11
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,208
[GOKU]
How long is it?

12
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,416
[GUIDE] They say it's
over ten thousand miles,

13
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,208
but nobody really
knows for sure!

14
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,833
[NARRATOR] As Goku boldly set
out on this new adventure,

15
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,791
little did he know,
back on Earth,

16
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:49,041
his son Gohan was about to
begin an adventure of his own.

17
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,833
Your father and I barely
managed to defeat

18
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,500
the Saiyan who
kidnapped you today.

19
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:53,833
And we've learned
that two more Saiyans,

20
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:58,208
even stronger, are on
their way to Earth...

21
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,791
We won't be able to
beat them alone...

22
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,333
That's why you're
going to train.

23
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,125
So you can fight
by our side!

24
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,458
[NARRATOR] After discovering
Gohan's hidden powers,

25
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,125
Piccolo has decided
to give the boy

26
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,291
a crash course
in martial arts.

27
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,583
If Gohan can endure Piccolo's
severe training for one year,

28
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,500
he could be a valuable
ally in the fight

29
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,583
against the Saiyans.

30
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,541
But the more pressing
question is...

31
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:21,250
Can he survive
the first day?

32
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,000
[GOHAN whimpers]

33
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,416
[GOHAN]
Um, okay, Mr. Piccolo.

34
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,916
I guess I'm ready.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,625
Uhh... So, what happens now?
What do we do first?

36
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:04,333
Heh, heh. We don't
do anything...

37
00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:05,333
You do.

38
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,875
Uhh!

39
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,208
I do?

40
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,333
[PICCOLO]
That's right.

41
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,458
The first thing
you need to do

42
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,208
is learn how to take
care of yourself.

43
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:19,833
If you can survive out here
for six months on your own,

44
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,458
I'll teach you
how to fight.

45
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,750
You want me to stay out
here all by myself?

46
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,250
I can't do that!

47
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,750
Uh... Uhh...

48
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,125
It's too scary!

49
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,166
Please, I don't
know what to do!

50
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,583
I've never been
all alone before.

51
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,208
[PICCOLO] Heh. That's the
whole point, isn't it?

52
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,208
Besides, you
won't be alone.

53
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,291
There'll be plenty of
hungry wild animals

54
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,541
to keep you company.

55
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,958
[GOHAN whimpers]

56
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,541
You mean like,
lions and tigers?

57
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,083
But they'll eat me!

58
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,250
Quiet! Crying
won't save you!

59
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,791
It's time to start
acting like a man.

60
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,291
Don't leave me.
Please?

61
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,291
You have to learn
to rely on yourself.

62
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:01,000
If you can find the courage
to survive on your own,

63
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:04,541
you'll be a stronger fighter,
both in body and in mind.

64
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,041
Remember, there's a
great power inside you,

65
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,250
waiting to be unlocked, but
it's up to you to bring it out.

66
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,541
Use it! Rely on it!

67
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,958
And if you can do that,

68
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,958
I guarantee you'll
live through this.

69
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,458
But...
I'm afraid.

70
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,083
[PICCOLO chuckles]

71
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,291
You'll laugh at
your fears

72
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,083
when you find out
who you really are!

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,208
I know you don't
believe it now,

74
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,791
but you already have everything
you need to survive.

75
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,166
Well then, I've got to
begin my own training.

76
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,583
See you in
six months.

77
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:40,333
No! I don't have anything!
What about food? Or a bed?

78
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,666
What am I supposed to
do out here all day?

79
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,416
What about
my homework?

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,875
I told you I wasn't
going to go easy on you.

81
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,250
You're on your own.

82
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,708
Uh... You can't leave me.

83
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,958
That's cruel.

84
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,416
Hey, guess what!

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,250
Sometimes, kid,
life is cruel.

86
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,333
And don't you
forget it.

87
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:05,541
Hey! Wait! Don't go!

88
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,833
Please! Come back,
Piccolo!

89
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:13,166
You were just kidding,
right? Come back!

90
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:32,000
[breathes heavily]

91
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:40,791
[sobs]

92
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:53,041
[POPO] Kami, what's wrong?
You look upset.

93
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:55,958
[KAMI] Huh?

94
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,375
It's Piccolo.

95
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:02,083
I can feel the evil
in his heart, and yet...

96
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,541
There seems to be a change
coming over him, Mr. Popo.

97
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,500
He's not acting like
the villain I would expect.

98
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:10,791
It's quite surprising.

99
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,625
Piccolo would never
have been willing

100
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,166
to train Goku's
son before.

101
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,541
[KAMI] Yes, I was equally
surprised when he agreed

102
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,166
to forge an alliance with Goku
in order to fight Raditz.

103
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,041
I realize he had his
own selfish motives...

104
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,458
But still... That does
not change the fact

105
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,208
that he chose to
defend the Earth,

106
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:31,500
instead of allowing
it to be destroyed.

107
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,583
Kakarot!

108
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:36,541
[KAMI] And though it may seem
Piccolo's true evil nature

109
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:39,250
revealed itself when
he eliminated Goku

110
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,625
along with Raditz...

111
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:45,541
We must not forget, that Goku
chose to make that sacrifice.

112
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,458
And perhaps,
his death was

113
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,708
actually a blessing
in disguise...

114
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,083
[KAMI] For now,
Goku has received permission

115
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,125
to seek King Kai's
training in Other World.

116
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,416
Piccolo knows that Goku
is certain to return,

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,125
and yet he has still
chosen to train his son,

118
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,125
a boy that may
one day grow to be

119
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,958
a powerful enemy
in his own right.

120
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,500
[POPO] I know. It doesn't
seem to make any sense...

121
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:13,250
Perhaps it does, Mr. Popo.
Perhaps it does.

122
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,125
Yes, Piccolo may have
realized as I have,

123
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:20,083
that in one year...
We will die.

124
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,833
What? No...

125
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,083
I'm sorry, Mr. Popo,
but I have foreseen it...

126
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:29,083
I do not know the exact cause,
whether Piccolo will lose

127
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,958
his life in the battle
against the Saiyans,

128
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:34,041
or if I will simply
pass away from old age.

129
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
But either way,
the result is the same.

130
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,666
But Kami...

131
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,666
[KAMI] My life force is
forever bound with Piccolo's.

132
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,916
We're two halves
of a single being.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,208
One cannot exist
without the other...

134
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,666
[KAMI chuckles]

135
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,666
Such is the curse
of foresight.

136
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,250
I'm able to see the
day of my own demise.

137
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,833
If Piccolo has indeed
sensed my mind,

138
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:01,125
he may wish to pass his
knowledge on before he dies.

139
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:05,291
Even if it's to the
son of his enemy.

140
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:10,166
Wait... What about
the Dragon Balls?

141
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,291
Hm. There's time
for one more wish.

142
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,541
[GOHAN] Waaah...
I don't wanna be alone.

143
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:21,791
Somebody? Anybody?
Please...

144
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:26,833
[GOHAN sobs]

145
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,083
Ah!

146
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,083
Hey there...

147
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,541
A-Ah!

148
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,500
[wind blows]

149
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,125
Hey! Wait up!

150
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,458
Uh...

151
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,750
'Kay...

152
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,625
[grunting]

153
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:15,125
Okay. I think I've got--Ah!

154
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,750
I think I've got it.

155
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,375
[sighs]

156
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:22,083
There you are!

157
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,625
Uh...

158
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,208
I'm not gonna find any of
your friends in here, am I?

159
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,791
Ah!

160
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,416
Hmm...

161
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,458
There. That wasn't
so bad, I guess...

162
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,791
Now let's see.

163
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,166
There's gotta be
somewhere I can go...

164
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:12,458
Oh hey, you don't know a place
where I can stay, do you?

165
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,833
[rattling sound]

166
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,041
[GOHAN laughs]

167
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,250
Great! I'll just
follow you!

168
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:20,625
[laughs]

169
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,916
[GOKU] Wow. I had no idea
Gohan was so strong!

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,625
What he did against
Raditz today was amazing!

171
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:31,291
I guess he's a chip of
the old block after all!

172
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,416
[laughs]

173
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
Huh?

174
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,625
Why do I feel I'm getting
nowhere all of a sudden?

175
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:44,833
I know! I may not be able
to fly, but I can still jump!

176
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,916
Yeah! Now that's
more like it!

177
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,625
[GOKU chuckles]

178
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,458
I should have done
this from the start!

179
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,958
A-Ahhh!

180
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,291
Then again, maybe
this was a bad idea!

181
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,541
Ahhhh!

182
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,083
Ahh! Ow! Oww!

183
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,208
Man! That's sharp!
Uh oh...

184
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,833
Ahh!

185
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,000
[breathes heavily]

186
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,791
Whew!

187
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,875
Whew! That was too
close for comfort.

188
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,583
I won't make that
mistake again!

189
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,916
I guess I still
have a long way to go.

190
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:22,041
Okay, now here I go.
Okay, uh, now...

191
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,333
[clears throat]

192
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,541
ChiChi, you're not going to
believe this but, uh...

193
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,708
Goku is gone,
and Gohan...

194
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:32,333
Well, we sort of let
Piccolo borrow him for a...

195
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,750
Well, for a while and uh...

196
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,791
Okay, how 'bout
this way...

197
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,875
ChiChi, um,
guess what!

198
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,416
Goku's in Other
World with Kami,

199
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,250
and Gohan, well,
he's been kidnapped again!

200
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,625
[forced laugh]

201
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,250
Oh! Krillin!

202
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,875
Uh, hi.
[stammers]

203
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,750
What are you doing here?
I thought Goku was with you.

204
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,166
Oh, well, he was, but uh...

205
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,666
You know how plans get changed,
you know... I mean...

206
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,500
Hey! Krillin! Hi!

207
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,750
Hi, Ox King, uh,
nice to see you...

208
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,500
Krillin, you're acting
strange. Where's Goku?

209
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:15,916
Right! Goku! Uh, well, to
tell you the truth, he's, uh...

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,916
He...

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What?

212
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,666
He's dea--Delayed!

213
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,666
[OX KING] Uhh?

214
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,083
He is?

215
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,833
Uh, yeah! That's it!
He's uh, he's running late!

216
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,291
[forced laugh]

217
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,041
Really? So, then
when is he coming back?

218
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,708
Uh, well, uh...

219
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,791
Actually, he's not coming back.

220
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,333
He's not
coming back?!

221
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,125
Well, he is!
Just not right away...

222
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,125
Krillin! Just what in the
world are you talking about?!

223
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,458
[OX KING]
ChiChi, now, now.

224
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,958
Why don't you
come in, Krillin?

225
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,666
ChiChi's got some
good dinner cooking.

226
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,958
[KRILLIN sighs]

227
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,333
[OX KING laughs]

228
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:01,083
I'm so excited to see
Gohan! I can't wait!

229
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,833
You know, I haven't seen
him in almost a year!

230
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,916
He's probably all
grown up by now!

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,208
[OX KING chuckles]

232
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,583
[KRILLIN thinking]
Aw, man. How can I tell him

233
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,625
he's gonna have to
wait another year?

234
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:12,666
I just don't have
the heart...

235
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,000
So, Krillin...
Where is everyone?

236
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,833
I tried calling
Kame House earlier,

237
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,250
but there
was no answer.

238
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:21,250
Oh! Well, uh,
there's no one on the island.

239
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:25,583
Yeah, I think they all went for
a ride in Master Roshi's boat!

240
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:30,291
A boat, yeah. No phone.
Yeah, that's it!

241
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,708
Oh, that sounds fun.
I didn't know Roshi had a boat.

242
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,791
It's... It's, uh, new.

243
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,166
Well, I hope
he's having fun.

244
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,833
Because Goku's got a lot
of explaining to do

245
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,291
when he gets back.

246
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,666
He should know better than
to keep Gohan out this long!

247
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,625
He has homework to do! Hmph!

248
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,291
[KRILLIN groans]

249
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,833
Now, ChiChi, calm down.
It's okay.

250
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,333
Goku knows what he's doing.

251
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,333
I'm sure they'll be
home any minute.

252
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,041
You're right, Dad. I'm sorry.
You know me, though...

253
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,875
Always worrying! Oh well,
I better finish making dinner.

254
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,500
Okay. Well, uh...

255
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,416
I should go now.

256
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,750
What? Really?
But you just got here!

257
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,333
No, Krillin. Please stay!
At least until Goku gets home.

258
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:15,916
That's right.
I insist!

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,083
But, I've got
a lot to do!

260
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,416
Not until you
have some dinner!

261
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,916
[KRILLIN quivers]

262
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,625
[GOHAN]
I wanna go home.

263
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,375
[loud thuds]

264
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,250
[DINOSAUR growls]

265
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,708
Hi...
I'm Gohan.

266
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
[roar]

267
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,791
Aaahhh!

268
00:16:55,791 --> 00:17:00,416
[screaming and roaring]

269
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,750
Somebody!

270
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:10,958
Somebody! Help!
Ah! Please!

271
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:19,791
[roar]

272
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208
Ahh!

273
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,500
[breathes heavily]

274
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:02,041
[GOHAN]
Wait. Where'd he go?

275
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,333
Uh-Uhh...

276
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,708
[wind blows]

277
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm stuck!
Can anyone hear me?

278
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,666
Waaah!

279
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,625
[OX KING laughs]

280
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,625
Looks great,
doesn't it, Krillin?

281
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,083
I hope Goku brings
Gohan back soon.

282
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,958
I'd hate for
them to miss out!

283
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,083
[KRILLIN] Uh-huh.

284
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,000
Ha! Goku can starve
for all I care!

285
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:56,666
Uhh...

286
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,208
Uhhh...

287
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,875
[CHICHI sighs]

288
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:15,375
[chattering]

289
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,666
Hamburger.

290
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,750
[CYCLOPS] I'll have the ribeye.
Hold the rib.

291
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,041
[GHOST] Mm-hm!

292
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,208
[GHOST exclaims]

293
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,541
Thanks.
Here you go.

294
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,541
Here's your change.

295
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,541
Let's see now.

296
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,541
There's ten, twenty, thirty...

297
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,083
Hmm...
You shorted me!

298
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
Oops...

299
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,541
[quivers]

300
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,791
He said, tell Master
Roshi and the others

301
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,291
not to wish me back with the
Dragon Balls for one year.

302
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,500
So, Goku want me to go
down to Kame House?

303
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,791
Yep! He said
he'll owe you one.

304
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,416
That boy already
owes me plenty.

305
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
But I suppose
I'll do it this once.

306
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,541
[stomach growls]

307
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,083
I don't know what that
guy was talking about!

308
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,375
He said I wouldn't have
to worry about food,

309
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,125
but I'm starving!

310
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:32,625
[GOHAN cries softly]

311
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:39,666
I'm hungry and cold...
and tired and scared...

312
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,458
[wind blows]

313
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,000
[thud]

314
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,166
Apples?

315
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,166
Wow! Two of 'em!

316
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,458
Wow! These look
delicious! Oh, boy!

317
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:55,041
Uh!

318
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:58,041
[GOHAN thinking]
Now that's weird...

319
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:01,208
I don't see a
tree anywhere.

320
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,666
Huh, well...

321
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:14,166
These apples
are sour...

322
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:26,083
I miss my mom's cooking.
I wanna eat a real dinner!

323
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:41,333
I wonder what she's
making tonight...

324
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,958
Spoiled kid.
Be glad you got that.

325
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,041
[GOHAN] Well, that's
a little better...

326
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:13,750
Nope... It's still
way too scary...

327
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,791
[PICCOLO thinking]
I hope you enjoyed it, kid.

328
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,958
That's the one and only
time I intend to help you.

329
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,291
If you can't survive
on your own after this,

330
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,458
then it means I was
wrong about you...

331
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,708
And you're just a
normal little brat.

332
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:45,166
[NARRATOR] Gohan's first day of
training was a difficult one.

333
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,000
But this will
seem all too easy

334
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,666
when compared with
the days ahead.

335
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,083
The true hardship
is yet to come!

336
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,541
Don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
