[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z.

2
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,083
In a desperate attempt
to defeat Gohan,

3
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,250
Cell prepared to release
a deadly Kamehameha Wave

4
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,666
aimed directly at the Earth.

5
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,500
[CELL] Here you go!

6
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,666
Let's see you try
and stop this!

7
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,500
[NARRATOR] But Gohan
stood his ground.

8
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,333
[CELL] HAAA!

9
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:44,208
[GOHAN] Kaa... meeh... haa...

10
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,833

11
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,250
HAA!

12
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,875
[NARRATOR} At the last moment,
Gohan countered Cell's attack

13
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,875
with his own more
powerful blast,

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,416
catching the monster
off guard

15
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,791
and saving the Earth
from certain destruction.

16

17
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,333
[NARRATOR] When the smoke
cleared, it was obvious

18
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,250
that Gohan's clever tactic
had done the trick.

19
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:08,875
Cell was half the cruel
creature that he used to be.

20
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,875
[GOHAN] I'm going
to let him suffer.

21
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,291
[NARRATOR] But Cell quickly
regenerated his lost limbs,

22
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,666
and bulked himself
up to maximum power

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,041
in an explosion of insane anger.

24
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,833
[CELL] Boy! You won't defeat me!

25
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:24,208
A worthless Saiyan like
you can't compete with me!

26
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,833
I am invincible!

27
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,958
[NARRATOR] Gohan took
Cell's words as a challenge

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,416
and booted the
beast in the belly

29
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,291
giving him a monstrous
case of indigestion.

30
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:36,083
It was too much for the
dastardly demon too handle.

31
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:39,708
His evil appetite came back to
haunt him as he lost his lunch

32
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,541
and his complete power
when he regurgitated

33
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,041
the unconscious Android 18!

34
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,791
Cell's strength is fading fast.

35
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,541
Will Gohan deliver
the final blow

36
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,000
and end his reign of terror?

37
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,208
