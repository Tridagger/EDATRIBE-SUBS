00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,666
The two Saiyans, the strongest
fighters in the universe,

3
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,500
continued their intergalactic
journey towards Earth...

4
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,791
Their goal, torment
the population

5
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,541
and wreak havoc
on the planet...

6
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,791
That is unless Goku and
the other Z warriors

7
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,333
can stop them...

8
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,208
But they'll have to move fast
because time is running out.

9
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,875
Oh man, how far does
this road go on?

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,000
It seems like there's
no end to it at all.

11
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,791
I've been running
for days and days...

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,583
I hope this is worth it because
it's been almost a year now

13
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,333
and I still haven't
found King Kai!

14
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:44,958
[NARRATOR]
Hang in there Goku,

15
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,291
remember you've got
Gohan and on your side.

16
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,583
And right now he's being
trained by Piccolo,

17
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,583
who is a great martial
artist in his own right!

18
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:58,250
[PICCOLO] Haaa!

19
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,500
[GOHAN yells]

20
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:03,000
[NARRATOR] Piccolo's methods
may seem a little rough

21
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,916
but compared to what
the Saiyans will do,

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,666
this training session
is a walk in the park.

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,333
If Gohan can master these
new fighting skills in time,

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,416
Earth still might
have a chance...

25
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,083
If he can't, then
it's all over!

26
00:03:15,166 --> 00:03:17,583
Come on, Gohan!
You can do it!

27
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,500
It's in your
hands now...

28
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,583
'Cause if you can't save
the day, then who will?

Destroy all life forms...

35
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:54,916
Wake up, Kakarot...

[groans]

38
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,416
[GOHAN] Ow! My head
really hurts.

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,750
Let's take a break
for awhile, okay?

40
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
[PICCOLO]
You don't need a break!

41
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:14,458
Now stop whining and
let's get back to work.

42
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
No, really, I don't
think I can move.

43
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,583
Heh, heh. Yah!

44
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,208
[PICCOLO]
Huh?

45
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,000
[GOHAN laughs]

46
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,833
Fooled ya!

47
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
[PICCOLO] Can't you jump
any higher than that?

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,458
[PICCOLO yells]

49
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,708
[GOHAN]
Aaaahhh! Piccolo!

50
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,958
I'll make that kid
stronger than all of us!

[GOHAN giggles]

56
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,208
Mmm! Pineapple!

57
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:16,083
Aaaahhhhh!

[GOKU screams]

59
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,875
So... I think I'll
finish you off!

60
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,250
Aaahhhh!

61
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,958
Say good-bye!

62
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,750

[whimpers]

64
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,791
Oh, man...
It was just a dream.

65
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,875
Don't...
hurt my Daddy!

[GOHAN grunts]

00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,791

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
[PICCOLO] Hm?

00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,333

77
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,458

00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,875
Alright!
Split Form!

91
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,791
[PICCOLO]
C'mon, Gohan! Let's go back!

92
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,541
For your own sake, don't
try anything foolish, Gohan!

[grunts]

94
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,458
[PICCOLO] There's nowhere
you can go, Gohan!

95
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,583
Now stop this foolishness
and go back to camp!

96
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,125

[frantic yelling]

103
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,333
His tail has grown back!

104
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,583
Be sure to make a
note of that, would ya?

105
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,666
[PICCOLO]
No problem!

106
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,958
I just hope he doesn't
transform again!

107
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,041
Not without the moon...

108
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,750
The moon!

that get back up there?!

[PICCOLO]
I don't know!

112
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:53,666
Maybe some one wished it
back with the Dragon Balls.

113
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,666
[OTHER PICCOLO]
I don't think so!

If I don't stop him,

00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,250
We got all seven Dragon Balls
with two months to spare,

00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,458
that's pretty good!

151
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,416

Oolong, your such a coward.

153
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:50,708
I'll bet you think taking
a shower is dangerous!

154
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,166
Well, it is unless you have
those gritty little stickers

155

on the bottom of the tub
that keep you from slipping,

156

but no, we were
in real danger,

00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,541
I hope Goku appreciates
what we did for him!

Oolong, can't you think of
anyone but yourself! Oh my?

00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,291
Sorry! The pressure of
all this has gotten to me!

some coffee? Huh?

Nice moon tonight,
isn't it?

Yes, it's beautiful.

A full moon!

Hey, is it just me or
does something look

168
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,375
different about it...

169
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,666
Just there's
no moonlight!

I can beat a Saiyan yet,

188
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,958
No way! How on Earth
am I going to stop him

189
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,625
if I can't even
get near him?

Huh? That's it!

194
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,500
The projection!

195
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,791
It's coming from that
Saiyan space-craft!

[COMPUTER] Wake up, Kakarot!
Destroy all life forms!

Goku's ship! What a legacy
to leave for his son!

199
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:21,708
Let's see if I can't bring

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,750
[PICCOLO] You're turning out
to be a lot more trouble

206
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,250
than I bargained for...

207
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,375
And there's the root of
the problem right there!

208
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,000
It's this tail
of yours!

209
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,708
Look at him!
Sleeping like a baby.

210

[PICCOLO] There!

213
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,625
That should take care
of you for a while

214
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:41,833
'cause I'm getting
too old for this, kid!

215
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,458
Sleep well, Gohan...
You'll need it.

[GOKU pants]

217
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:00,000
Whew! Hm?

218
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,833
No way! I must be
seeing things!

219
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,666
It couldn't be! It is!

220
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,458
It's the end!

221

Huh?

228
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,333
Is this some kind
of bad joke?

229
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,583
There's nothing here!

230
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,125
[GOKU] I just can't
believe it! Nothing!

231
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:48,458
Oh, wait a second! There!

232
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:57,375
That's it! King Kai must live
on that tiny little planet!

Woo-hoo!

234

236
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,458
Check that out!

237
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,458
Nice wheels!

238
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:19,750

[grunting continues]

244
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,875
This is nuts! How could
anyone live in a place

245
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:54,000
with this
much gravity?

246
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:54,958
Ah!

00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,708
Wow! Intense!

248
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:01,000

I made it, now just
one... step at a time!

251
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,583
There's a house...

252
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:24,000
That's got to be
King Kai's place.

253
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:28,000
Almost there!
I can make it!

254

[grunting continues]

255
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,875
Wait a second!

256
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,666
I thought I smelled food!
Well, first things first!

fruit, I'm in for a treat!

woulda pegged this guy

266
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:25,916

[GOKU] Uh, excuse me
King Kai, my name is Goku.

268

Listen, I'm kinda
hungry, sir,

272
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,833

Sir Isaac Newton would have
never lived to tell about it

if one of those
apples had hit him!

Hey, King Kai!

282
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:13,541
Would you mind throwing
one more apple down?
