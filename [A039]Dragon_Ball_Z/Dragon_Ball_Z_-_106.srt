1
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,083
[GOKU] Get down, now!

2
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,708
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

3
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:21,416
Frieza's evil plan to dominate
the Universe finally fell apart!

4
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,583
With the planet Namek teetering
on the edge of destruction,

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:28,291
it was time for Goku
to bid Frieza farewell!

6
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,166
[NARRATOR] But the half of
Frieza that Goku left behind

7
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,291
obviously wasn't
his better half!

8
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,500
Unable to accept defeat,
the one-armed, legless villain

9
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,583
bitterly gathered his energy
for a last ditch effort

10
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,708
to hit Goku from behind!

11
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,916
Huh?

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,083
[NARRATOR] The Super Saiyan
had had enough though.

13
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,750
Having already spared
Frieza's life twice,

14
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,333
it was time to put an end
to this shameless menace

15
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,416
once and for all!

16
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:07,333
[screams]

17
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,750
[NARRATOR] But can Goku make it
off Namek before it explodes?

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,625
Find out, today!

19
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:25,250
[distant rumbling]

20
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,041
I can't take this!

21
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,958
Has anything happened, King Kai?

22
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,750
[TIEN]
I've got to know! Please!

23
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,916
[KING KAI] Yes, something
has happened, Tien!

24
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,458
The fight is over!
Frieza is dead!

25
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,916
[ALL gasp]

26
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,833
Frieza was pleading
for his life to Goku,

27
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,500
so Goku tried to help him out!

28
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,583
He gave Frieza
some of his own power!

29
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,083
[KING KAI] But instead of
using the power to escape,

30
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,625
Frieza turned on Goku,
and used it to attack him!

31
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,041
[grunts] Man, what a jerk!

32
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,166
[KING KAI] Indeed! So Goku was
forced to deliver the final blow

33
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
to put an end
to the fight for good.

34
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,083
All right! You're saying
that Goku won, right?

35
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,375
Yes, after Goku transformed
into a Super Saiyan,

36
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,375
Frieza found himself
totally outclassed.

37
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,250
Yes!

38
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,083
[YAMCHA and CHIAOTZU laughing]

39
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,250
[TIEN] Oh wow. That means
Goku is the strongest fighter

40
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,791
in the Universe. Whatd'ya know!

41
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,750
Right from our own backyard!

42
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,541
I wouldn't mind a little
sparring session,

43
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:04,666
just to see how I measure up!

44
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,375
[CHIAOUTZU laughs]

45
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,083
Hold it! Quiet!

46
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,208
[BOTH] Huh?

47
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,500
Goku defeated Frieza
but he didn't win!

48
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,875
As a matter of fact,
he just might lose!

49
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,791
Lose? But how?

50
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:21,416
By still being on Namek
when it explodes, that's how!

51
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,583
[YAMCHA] Oh.

52
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,208
He doesn't have enough time!

53
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,666
He's heading to
Frieza's spaceship

54
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,750
because it's closer than his!

55
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,916
But Namek could blow
any second now!

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,666
The surface looks like
boiling spaghetti sauce.

57
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,958
It would take a miracle
to get him out in time!

58
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,500
[KING KAI] But I haven't
given up hope... not yet!

59
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,166
Hey! Goku's gotten himself
out of some hairy situations!

60
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,500
If there's any way out,
he'll find it!

61
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,541
He's like the great
Houdini or something.

62
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:50,791
I guarantee,
he'll get out of there!

63
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:56,125
C'mon! Guys! This is Goku
we're talking about! Lighten up!

64
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,791
[KING KAI] I wish that there
was something to

65
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,458
"lighten up" about!

66
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,291
Uhh... I guess you'd
just have to see it!

67
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,041
[GOKU] There it is! Oh, great!
It looks pretty beat up!

68
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,500
Darn!

69
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,583
[GOKU] Okay now,
where's the bridge?

70
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,916
[GOKU] Oh, man!
I don't think this is it!

71
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,666
[grunts]

72
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,666
[GOKU] I'm getting a
bad feeling about this!

73
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,666
[GOKU panting]

74
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,666
[grunts]

75
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,458
[GOKU yells]

76
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,250
[GOKU]
C'mon, baby! Please work!

77
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,583
[beeping]

78
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:36,000
All right! Now I just need to
figure out how to make it go.

79
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,000
[GOKU] C'mon, c'mon!

80
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,333
There! That's it!

81
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:49,666
[engine humming]

82
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,500
Huh?

83
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:55,416
[GOKU] Aah. It's working!
Come on! Come on!

84
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,416
[GOKU] Huh?
Oh, no, what happened?

85
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,541
It died! Piece of junk!

86
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,083
What now?

87
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,000
[GOKU] Oh, man!
Please work! Come on!

88
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,291
Come on, baby, work for me!

89
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,208
[gasps]

90
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,666
[grunts]

91
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,708
[grunting]

92
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,083
[GOKU] Man o' man! Now what?!

93
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,375
That was my only
ticket outta here!

94
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,958
Eeeeh yow!

95
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,166
[BOTH] Huh?

96
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,500
Aaah! Whoa! That was a doozy!

97
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:48,916
Oh no! No!

98
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,666
Hey, what's wrong?!
Something's up!

99
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,125
[KING KAI] It's Frieza's ship!

100
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,625
Goku got to it in time,
but it's broken!

101
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,041
What a lemon!

102
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,375
And now it's gone!
Swallowed up by the lava!

103
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,458
[YAMCHA grunts]

104
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,875
Was Goku on it?!

105
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,750
[KING KAI] No! But that was
Goku's only way

106
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,333
to get off of Namek!

107
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,791
He's stuck there now. Alone.

108
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,125
The only soul
on the whole planet,

109
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,166
and it's about to blow!

110
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,041
There's nothing he can
do anymore, guys. It's over.

111
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,125
--[YAMCHA] Goku...
--[CHIAOTZU] Goku...

112
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,041
[GOKU] I won't give up!

113
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,375
I will not give up!

114
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:55,250
[yells]

115
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,208
[grunts]

116
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:58,541
It's happening, you guys!

117
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,416
Goku...!

118
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,416
No way!

119
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,708
It can't be... Goku, no!

120
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:19,791
Oh, no...!

121
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:26,500
[GOKU yells]

122
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,708
[TIEN] King Kai...?
What happened?!

123
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,125
It's over, isn't it?!

124
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:17,875
[KING KAI] I think so...

125
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,750
Yes. Let me make sure.

126
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,916
[grunting]

127
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,333
[KING KAI] Just as I feared!

128
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,750
There is no more Planet Namek.

129
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,208
It's gone!

130
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:43,916
Sorry, you guys. I know
how much you cared about him.

131
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,041
[YAMCHA grunts]

132
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:50,791
No! Goku!

133
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,666
[YAMCHA]
You sacrificed everything...

134
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,583
Goodness gracious!

135
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,000
I guess I need to
give the bad news to Gohan.

136
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,958
It'll break his heart for sure.

137
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:11,875
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
How can I tell him?!

138
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,500
You could try breaking
the news through Bulma.

139
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,583
That's not a bad idea.

140
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:21,166
I can tell her, King Kai.
I'm close to Bulma.

141
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,333
[KING KAI] So be it, Yamcha.
Come forward.

142
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,000
You know the score.

143
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:31,458
Right.

144
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,625
[KING KAI]
Whenever you're ready, Yamcha.

145
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,291
[YAMCHA] Okay, here goes!

146
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,208
[YAMCHA]
Bulma! Can you hear me?!

147
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,500
[BULMA] Huh?! Who said that?

148
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,166
I must be losing my mind!

149
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,833
[YAMCHA] Bulma, you're not
losing your mind.

150
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,541
It's me, Yamcha.

151
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,750
Huh? Yamcha. Where?
I don't see you.

152
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,625
[ALL] Huh?

153
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,875
[BULMA] I can hear you though.

154
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,000
Did somebody
shrink you or something?

155
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,083
[YAMCHA] No. Nobody
shrunk me. I'm full-sized.

156
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,375
Look, Bulma. I'm communicating
with you telepathically!

157
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,500
King Kai arranged it.
I'm relaying a message for him.

158
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,208
No way!

159
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:16,083
Bulma, Yamcha's talking to you?

160
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,416
It's King Kai!
He must have a message!

161
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,875
Hey, that's what he said!
Man, that's wild!

162
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,625
Telepathy, huh? So it's
true then. It is Yamcha.

163
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,666
Hi-ya, Yamcha! What's up?

164
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,166
[YAMCHA]
Notta lotta! Just hanging out

165
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,666
with the other dead guys.
You know how it is.

166
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,916
[YAMCHA] But, hey,
I have to hurry because, uh,

167
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,083
I'm sort of
calling long distance.

168
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,166
It's about Goku, Bulma.

169
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,375
The fight on Namek is over.

170
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,291
[BULMA]
You're kidding. Who won?!

171
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:45,875
[YAMCHA] Goku did!
He beat Frieza! But, uhh...

172
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,500
Goku won?! All right!
That's our Goku!

173
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,791
Hey, guys! Goku won!

174
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:56,125
Wow! Dad really won?!
Yay! Wooo!

175
00:14:56,208 --> 00:15:01,708
[GOHAN and DENDE laughing]

176
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,583
[PICCOLO]
Goku! You did it, my friend!

177
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,666
[chuckles]

178
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,375
[laughing]

179
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,833
[VEGETA]
He did it?! Unbelievable!

180
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,416
[YAMCHA] Bulma, please, listen!

181
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,583
That's not the end of
the story. There's more.

182
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,458
After Goku defeated Frieza,

183
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,958
he tried to use
Frieza's spaceship

184
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,333
to high-tail it out of there.

185
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:26,000
But the darn thing
bugged out on him.

186
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,083
He was stuck!
With no way out!

187
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:33,000
When Namek exploded,
Goku went with it! He's gone.

188
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,333
Hold on, guys! There's more!

189
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,083
[BULMA] Goku didn't make it off
Planet Namek before it exploded.

190
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,375
--[BULMA] He's dead.
--[YAMCHA] Huh?!

191
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,541
[BULMA] What a bummer!

192
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,875
[YAMCHA]
Bulma, what are you doing?!

193
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you nuts?! You're not
giving a weather report

194
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,833
or announcing the score
of a football game!

195
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,375
The kid's dad just died!

196
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,250
I could have done
a better job than that!

197
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,875
[lauhging]

198
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,541
Duh! Now listen up, pea brain!

199
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,375
I'm the one with the
real inside scoop, not you.

200
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,375
What would you say
if I told you that

201
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,125
with the Dragon
Balls from Namek,

202
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:04,333
you can wish people back to
life more than just one time.

203
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,916
That means that we can
wish everybody back.

204
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,625
Goku, Krillin, and Chiaotzu
can all be wished back!

205
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,875
[BULMA] You're all coming home!
How do you like them apples?!

206
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,125
And it's not going to
take that long either!

207
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,708
So just chill! You dork!

208
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,208
I was always the brains of the
outfit when we were together,

209
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,666
and you were always the brawn.

210
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,250
[YAMCHA]
Oh, man! Same ol' Bulma.

211
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,833
Yamcha. What's up?!

212
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,666
[TIEN] What's going on?!

213
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,958
It looks like we're goin' home!

214
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,500
Hey, Chiaotzu,
that means you too!

215
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,500
Me?!

216
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,041
What's the deal?!

217
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,333
[KING KAI] Using the Nameks'
Dragon Balls is a great idea,

218
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,166
but I'm afraid it won't
help Goku and Krillin.

219
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,416
[TIEN] Why not?!

220
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,666
Well, when the Dragon
restores someone's life,

221
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,083
he brings them back to
the place where they died.

222
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:53,041
But Goku and Krillin
died on Namek.

223
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, I get it now.
Namek isn't there.

224
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,166
Yes, you hit the nail
on the head. Namek's gone.

225
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,416
What a shame.
It was a great idea.

226
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,375
But can we try it anyway?!

227
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,458
Of course you can, but I
already know what would happen.

228
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,000
Trust me, it's not something

229
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,875
you'd want to do
to your friends.

230
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,375
[KING KAI] They would
materialize in space...

231
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:17,208
Right where Namek used to be.

232
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:21,375
And die a lonely death
in the middle of nowhere.

233
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:22,500
[gasps]

234
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,125
[gasps]

235
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,791
[gasps]

236
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,333
King Kai! There must be
something you can do!

237
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,833
Can't you use your powers
to help them?!

238
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,625
I wish I could.

239
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,916
I'd gladly step in
if it was within my power!

240
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,791
[KING KAI]
I'm sorry, guys. Really.

241
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,750
What's wrong, Bulma?
You look sad.

242
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:59,125
King Kai... he said...
that Goku can't come back...

243
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,458
[BOTH gasp]

244
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:01,750
I-If we wished them back,

245
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,666
they would go to
the planet Namek,

246
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,958
but the planet Namek's gone.

247
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,750
Dad?! No way!
You're gone for good?!

248
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,666
[PICCOLO] I'm sorry, Gohan.

249
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,333
[VEGETA laughs]

250
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,875
I told you, didn't I?!

251
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,083
It looks like my prophecy
came to pass after all.

252
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,333
I'm number one now, guys.
So get used to it.

253
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,625
It was nice of your dad, kid.

254
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:39,000
[VEGETA] Getting rid
of Frieza like that for me.

255
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,458
What a guy!
He served his purpose.

256
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,958
Jerk! You're nothing
compared to him!

257
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
He spared your life twice!

258
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,541
He shouldn't have
been so soft, should he?

259
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,458
Which leads me to the question
of what to do with his son.

260
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,750
[VEGETA] Destroy him now, so he
doesn't destroy me someday?!

261
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,291
Don't sweat it, kiddo.

262
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,625
You're the only
Saiyan left besides me.

263
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,125
That makes you a
very important young man.

264
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,166
We're the last survivors
of an Ancient race.

265
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,583
[VEGETA] Besides, I need
someone like you at my side

266
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,583
to polish my boots
and call me Lord Vegeta.

267
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,083
[laughs]

268
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,083
My dad'll be back, you watch!

269
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,416
[laughs]

270
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,958
You're dad is history, kid!

271
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,541
[yells, groans]

272
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,416
Hm!

273
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,541
Hey, you leave him alone, jerk!

274
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,000
[gasps]

275
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
[VEGETA]
Are you challenging me, kid?

276
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,583
I wouldn't recommend it.

277
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,791
It's your call. Go ahead!

278
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,750
My dad will take care of you!

279
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,333
And he will be back!

280
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,041
[yells]

281
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,333
[GOHAN yells]

282
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,208
[VEGETA grunts]

283
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,041
[GOHAN yells]

284
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,291
[yells]

285
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,375
[VEGETA coughs]

286
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,958
[BULMA] Gohan!

287
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:22,375
[groans]

288
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,416
[VEGETA] All right, kid,
that does it!

289
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,583
If you want to challenge the
Prince of all Saiyans, you can!

290
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,666
But I promise,
this fight will be your last!

291
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,833
[panting]

292
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,750
You're making a big mistake.

293
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,083
[yells]

294
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,666
[VEGETA] Where do
you think you're going?

295
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,125
Hmm?

296
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,500
[VEGETA grunting]
[GOHAN groaning]

297
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,333
[VEGETA chuckles]

298
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,291
Oh, no! Gohan's
in serious trouble!

299
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,833
Gohan, no!

300
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,916
[PICCOLO] Hang in there, kid.

301
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,666
[VEGETA grunts]

302
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,416
[GOHAN yells]

303
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,333
[screams]

304
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,333
[VEGETA] Pity!
What a waste of talent.

305
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,791
Bye.

306
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,583
Hm?

307
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,041
Not today! Back off!

308
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,250
[VEGETA scoffs]

309
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,666
Ah... Have it your way.

310
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,458
Please... Father...
Come home...

311
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,458
I know you're
still up there somewhere.

312
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:09,458
You have to be.

313
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,666
I need you, Dad...!

314
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,666
[grunts]

315
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,000
A tough guy like you should
be able to face the truth!

316
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,750
[DENDE] Are you, okay?
I don't see how you did it.

317
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,125
Father...

318
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,666
Goku...

319
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,750
[BULMA] Goku!

320
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,916
[NARRATOR] The planet
Namek finally exploded

321
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
and has disappeared
without a trace!

322
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,208
And Goku is gone as well!

323
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,541
Is the pure-hearted savior
really just a memory now?

324
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:54,333
Find out, on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
