00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,000
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:19,375
Tragedy struck, when Goku's
evil older brother, Raditz,

3
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,291
kidnapped Gohan!

4
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,250
Daddy! Help me!
Daddy!

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,416
[NARRATOR] Goku raced
after the sinister Saiyan

6
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,750
to take back his son.

7
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,250
But with little hope of
overpowering Raditz alone,

8
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,250
he had no choice but
to accept the help

9
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,208
of a most unlikely ally...

10
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,875
Goku has joined forces

11
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:39,916
with one of his most
dangerous enemies... Piccolo!

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,166
[RADITZ] Hm...

13
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,416
Well, well, well.

14
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,166
Look who's decided
to drop in.

15
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,625
It's little brother.

16
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,875
Oh, and he's brought
the green man with him.

17
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,750
I was wondering who that
second insignificant blip

18
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,291
on my scouter
might be...

19
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,458
[NARRATOR] Radtiz was
far from intimidated

20
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,250
when confronted by the Earth's
two greatest fighters.

21
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,583
In a flash, he gave
them a demonstration

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,083
of his own power that
proved, even together,

23
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,125
Goku and Piccolo had
little chance for victory.

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,708
Raditz's otherworldly
strength and speed

25
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,541
already make him the
most powerful opponent

26
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,708
Goku or Piccolo
has ever faced.

27
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:16,625
But this, it seems, is only
the tip of the iceberg.

28
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:20,375
If you think I'm strong now,
wait until I catch my stride.

29
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,750
The truth is, I'm just
getting warmed up.

30
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,625
[NARRATOR] Is there any hope
of defeating this deadly foe?

31
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,000
Find out, today!

32
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,625
[RADITZ]
I'll tell you what...

33
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:47,416
Seeing as how your power
levels are more or less equal,

34
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,083
why don't we make a
little game out of this?

35
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,333
We'll call it,

36
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,333
"Which of you can last
against me the longest."

37
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,625
The rules are simple.

38
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,625
I cause you both a
great deal of pain,

39
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,916
and you writhe
around in agony.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,958
The loser is the first
to beg for mercy.

41
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,916
That's it... I don't
care how strong he is.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,708
I'm not going to stand
here and listen to this.

43
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,250
I would
prefer to die!

44
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,666
[laughs]

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
Don't you worry
about it green man,

46
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,875
we'll get to that
in due time!

47
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,791
Hey, don't get
ahead of yourself.

48
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,875
You haven't
beaten us yet.

49
00:04:30,958 --> 00:04:33,833
Trust me, Kakarot. I know
an easy win when I see one.

50
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,291
I'm a Saiyan!
It's what I do.

51
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,708
[PICCOLO] Come on, Goku.
Let's finish this guy!

52
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,041
We'll charge
him together!

53
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,750
Wait...
Not yet...

54
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,666
Not until he tells us what
he's done with Gohan...

55
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
Now, where is he?
Where have you hidden him?

56
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,833
Right...
Your little son...

57
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,666
You think you're
going to save him?

58
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,041
Who's getting ahead
of himself now?

59
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,875
This is the last time
I'm going ask you!

60
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,750
Where is my son?!

61
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,083
[RADITZ] Spare me the
fatherly dramatics.

62
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,125
You can have a last look
at him if you want.

63
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:08,000
He's locked inside my
space pod, behind you.

64
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
Ah!

65
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,333
[cries]

66
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,500
Gohan...

67
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,750
Daddy, help! Please, Daddy!

68
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,833
Get me out!

69
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,375
Be strong, Gohan!

70
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,416
I'll be down to help you
in a minute. Just hold on!

71
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,791
[RADITZ] Ha!
You'll be down all right...

72
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,750
But you won't be
helping anybody!

73
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,583
You should say
your goodbyes though!

74
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,916
You won't get
another chance.

75
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,875
No. I won't lose.

76
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,666
All right.
Let's do this!

77
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,625
[RADITZ chuckles]

78
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,375
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

79
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:26,916
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

80
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,083
Heh.

81
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,166
[chuckles]

82
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,750
[GOKU and PICCOLO yell]

83
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,208
Where did he go?!

84
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,500
Right here!

85
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,666
Heh!

86
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,208
[RADITZ chuckles]

87
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,500
[RADITZ] What's the
matter with you two?

88
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,500
You could at least try to make
better sport of it than this!

89
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,333
You don't want me to
get bored, do you?

90
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:22,958
[GOKU groans]

91
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,041
Piccolo, are you alright?

92
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,541
Ah!

93
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,583
[PICCOLO groans]

94
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,833
Don't worry about it.
It's not as bad as it looks...

95
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,416
I'm not out of
this fight yet.

96
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,916
[RADITZ laughs]

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,083
Oh, excuse me, has
anyone seen my arm?

98
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,041
[RADITZ laughs]

99
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,958
You can't miss it...
It's green!

100
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:56,333
[RADITZ laughs]

101
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:07,541
Uh... How we doin', Bulma?
We getting close?

102
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,791
[BULMA]
I think so.

103
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,833
But I'd need the Dragon
Radar to know for sure.

104
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,000
I just hope Goku's
doing all right.

105
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,000
I've got a terrible
feeling about all this.

106
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,666
Well, at least we know
that with Piccolo,

107
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,416
his chances are about
as good as they can get.

108
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,000
But the fact that
he's with Piccolo

109
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,166
is what worries
me the most!

110
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,833
I mean, he's one
of the bad guys!

111
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:27,000
For all we know, he's
already teamed up with

112
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,875
Raditz and blasted
Goku--Oh...

113
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:31,625
Goku can't beat
Raditz alone,

114
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,416
and I doubt any of us
could be much help...

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,916
So we might as well put
our faith in Piccolo.

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,375
If he can't help
Goku, or won't,

117
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,458
then there's no
one else who can.

118
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,916
[KRILLIN sighs]

119
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,833
[KRILLIN thinking]
Good luck, Goku.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,083
Come on, now.

121
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,750
Surely that pathetic
excuse for an attack

122
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,541
wasn't the best
you could do.

123
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,583
Okay, Goku. If you have
any new techniques

124
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,708
you've been waiting
to use, now's the time.

125
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,916
Heh, heh... Sorry...
I wish I did!

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,833
Hmph! You slacker...

127
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,416
While you've been
taking it easy,

128
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,625
I've been developing
a new attack!

129
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,916
[RADITZ] Fools!
Haven't you figured it out yet?

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,250
All of your
planning is futile!

131
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,166
Whisper all you want, but
you're still going to die!

132
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,166
So you think this attack
of yours has enough power

133
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,333
to do some
damage, Piccolo?

134
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,416
Yes!

135
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,333
And can you do it
with only one arm?

136
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
[PICCOLO]
Yeah, that's no problem.

137
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,416
The problem is,

138
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,375
it takes me a while to
gather the energy for it.

139
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,250
[RADITZ chuckles]

140
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,916
So, you'll have to
last against him alone

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,750
for five minutes.
It's your decision.

142
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,791
All right... If you're sure
it'll work, I'll hold him off.

143
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,208
Well, the truth is
it's untested...

144
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,083
I've never tried it
against an opponent.

145
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,333
I was hoping to save it
for a special occasion.

146
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:58,291
It's the attack I planned
to use to defeat you.

147
00:10:58,375 --> 00:11:01,375
[GOKU] I see, and now
you're using it to help me.

148
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,083
You must be terribly
disappointed.

149
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,958
[PICCOLO] No. This
will be a good test.

150
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,208
And if it works, I'll be
using it on you next.

151
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,625
Ha, ha. Figures.

152
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:14,750
You know, that wasn't actually
intended to be funny.

153
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,500
[RADITZ thinking]
What are they laughing at?

154
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,875
Planning something
clever, no doubt.

155
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,291
I guess I'll be sure to watch
out the next time we meet.

156
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:24,041
But for now,
wish me luck.

157
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,166
All right.
Do your best, Goku!

158
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,166
[GOKU yells]

159
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,500
[PICCOLO grunts]

160
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,875
Heh.

161
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,083
[RADITZ thinking]
It's about time.

162
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,458
[PICCOLO grunts]

163
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,958
Huh?
He's persistent!

164
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,250
Kaaameee!

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,750
Impossible! His power
level is sky rocketing!

166
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:52,083
900! 950!

167
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:55,000
Haaa!

168
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,083
But how?

169
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,375
He knows how to raise
his power level

170
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,041
by concentrating his
energy onto one spot!

171
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:02,958
[GOKU] Meee!

172
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,208
[beeping]

173
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,750
What?

174
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,458
His power level has
gone up as well!

175
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,208

Look how easily it
pierced my armor! Heh.

needs a little work.

All for nothing!

[PICCOLO] Yes, Goku!
With pleasure!

I see you had a surprise
attack after all, you sly dog!

you're not going to go
through with this!

you tried to kill me.

remember right,

you said you were going to
exterminate every human

I would have done or said
anything to get you to join us.

to leave?

that you won't join!

trick you! Don't let him go!
