1
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:16,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,708
It looked like Videl
was going to stomp

3
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:22,125
her opponent Spopovitch.

4
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,083
[ANNOUNCER] Spopovitch is down!

5
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,750
[NARRATOR] The battling beauty
matched punch-for-punch

6
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,625
with the hard-headed hulk
and her fancy footwork

7
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,541
stopped the big lug
dead in his tracks.

8
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,458
[NARRATOR] When she
sent Spopovitch flying

9
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,750
then landed a high
kick to his head,

10
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,166
everyone assumed
the match was over.

11
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,166
[VIDEL yells]

12
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,166
[SPOPOVITCH grunts]

13
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,750
He's down!

14
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,250
[NARRATOR] But no matter what
combination she threw at him,

15
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:53,416
Spopovitch kept
coming back for more!

16
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,875
[VIDEL growls,
SPOPOVITCH grunts]

17
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,125
[NARRATOR] Even a
head-spinning super kick

18
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,125
couldn't bring the brute down.

19
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,125
[SPOPOVITCH rasps]

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,625
Oh, she didn't...!

21
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:08,083
[SPOPOVITCH grunts,
bones creaking]

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,916
[VIDEL whimpers]

23
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,083
What the...?!

24
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,708
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

25
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:21,166
[NARRATOR] Videl tried to catch
her breath high above the crowd.

26
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,291
But when Spopovitch
came after her,

27
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,958
she knew she was in trouble.

28
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,208
Now that the bald-headed bully
has an unlimited supply

29
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:32,083
of super strength, does this
mean it's lights out for Videl?

30
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:35,416
Find out today on Dragon Ball Z!

31
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,666
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,291
Spopovitch is flying in the air!

33
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,291
Now there's no place left
for Videl to hide!

34
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,916
[SPOPOVITCH growls]

35
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,625
No way...

36
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:04,250
[SPOPOVITCH chuckles]

37
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,541
[VIDEL whimpers]

38
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:25,208
Whoa... Hey... Don't you have
to have a license to do that?

39
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:29,791
Look! How does he do that?!
He could never fly before!

40
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,333
What is his secret?!

41
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,875
[KILLA mumbles incoherently]

42
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:39,291
[SPOPOVITCH chuckles]

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,916
[VIDEL thinking]
So he can fly, too?!

44
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,708
[SPOPOVITCH yells]

45
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,958
[VIDEL gasps]

46
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:58,000
[yelling continues]

47
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,333
[VIDEL screams]

48
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,791
--No!
--An energy wave!

49
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:16,208
[VIDEL grunting]

50
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,458
[VIDEL yells]

51
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,416

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,333
[CROWD murmuring]

53
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:25,791
[VIDEL whimpers]

54
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,125
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

55
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:29,708
[SPOPOVITCH grunts]

56
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,208
[SPOPOVITCH chuckles]

57
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:38,166
[VIDEL grunts]

58
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,500
[VIDEL thinking]
This guy is a... monster!

59
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,625
Ah! I don't believe it!

60
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:48,666
But it's a good thing this guy's
energy waves aren't very strong.

61
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,875
You're wrong.

62
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,083
Huh?

63
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,000
The guy's got some sort
of unlimited power.

64
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,166
He'll lose the match
if he kills her.

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,250
"Unlimited power?"

66
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,833
I don't know how
he's doing it

67
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:04,541
but somehow Spopovitch is using
powers he's never had before!

68
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,166
Huh?

69
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,541
It's strange...

70
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,625
But the last time he fought
in this tournament,

71
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,875
I'm positive he couldn't fly
or throw an energy attack.

72
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,625
But what does that mean, Dad?

73
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,416
I don't know...

74
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,375
I don't know how he could have
changed this much, Gohan.

75
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,875
[SPOPOVITCH growls quietly]

76
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,583
[VIDEL thinking]
He doesn't scare me!

77
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,250
I'm the daughter of Mr. Satan,

78
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,916
the man who defeated Cell!
I know I can beat him...

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,708
and I will!

80
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:42,416

[VIDEL whimpers]

86
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,208
Videl's hit the
ground hard!

87
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,166
Let's hope that she can get up!

[VIDEL grunting]

89
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,208
Aah...

90
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:19,875
Oh! Videl is struggling
to get back in the fight!

91
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:24,083
What willpower!
What determination!

92
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,041
No...

93
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,708
I will never give up! Never!

This is awful!

106
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:14,208
What a nightmare!
Videl doesn't have a chance!

107
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,708
I hate to say it, but I think
her luck has officially run out.

108

[MR. SATAN grunting]

109
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,375
[MR. SATAN] Hmm...

110
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,416
You know, I probably
shouldn't go all out

111
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,791
in this first match...

112
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,250
It'll make for a better show

113
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:33,708
if I save some of my special
techniques for the final.

[MR. SATAN grunts]

115

It's never been easy controlling
my incredible strength.

Hmm...

117
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,958
But it is my job to give the
people what they paid for.

[knocking]

119
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,250
Uh, Mr. Satan... I thought
you might wanna know

120
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,708
that Videl is about to lose her
match to Spopovitch!

121
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,833
Come on! Not this again.

122
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,041
You know what?
You got it backwards.

123
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,875
Videl is gonna win!

124
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,208
Heee!

125
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,875
Sir! You really
should take a look!

126
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,833
[MR. SATAN] Can't you see I'm
getting warmed up

127
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,166
for my next match?!

128
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,000
So for the last time, I'm
not worried about Videl!

129
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,958
Come and get me when she wins!

130

has given Videl the toss!

she'll lose the match!

Wow! I don't believe it,

but Spopovitch has saved Videl
from falling out of the ring!

149
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,916
What on earth could
he be planning to do now?!

Oh no!

moving at all!

back on her feet!

00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:24,208
There's no way that kid
can beat Spopovitch!

356
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,583
But don't worry, Sweetheart.
Your daddy will get him for you!

357
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,416
[MR. SATAN screams]

358
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,458
Oh no! Videl!

359
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,250
Don't tell me that that kid
is your boyfriend?!

360
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,750
I won't allow it!
Do you hear me?!

361
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,166
I do not approve of this!

362
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,291
You know I've always said that
if you have a boyfriend,

363
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,000
then he must
be strong like me!

364
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,708
Not a feeble, little twerp!

365
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,541
How can he protect
my little girl?!

366
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,250
[DOCTOR] Mr. Satan!
Quiet please!

367
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,291
[MR. SATAN] Uh! Oh,
uh? Oh, of course...

368
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,666
[KORIN] Here are the
Senzu beans, Goku.

369
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,958
[GOKU] Thanks a lot, Korin!

370
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:15,250
Remember, my friend. I wouldn't
use all those beans at once.

371
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,708
Alright?

372
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:22,125
I have a feeling you're going
to need every one of them.

373
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,875
Yeah.

374
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,125
Me, too!

375
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:30,458
[NARRATOR] Goku has the
Senzu beans to heal Videl,

376
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,750
but he'd better hold onto a
handful in case of emergency.

377
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,583
As the World Martial Arts
Competition continues,

378
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:40,041
there is sure to be more
casualties along the way.

379
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,458
Korin senses trouble
on the horizon.

380
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:46,375
And after watching Spopovitch
turn into a super-powered psycho

381
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:49,083
Goku has every reason
to believe him.

382
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,000
What awaits the next competitor
who steps into the ring?

383
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,125

Dragon Ball Z!
