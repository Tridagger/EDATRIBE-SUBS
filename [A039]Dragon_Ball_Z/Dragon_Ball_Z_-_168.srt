00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:14,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:19,083
Cell took to the airwaves to
announce his malicious plan.

3
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:21,833
[CELL] Exactly nine
days from today...

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,416
bring me your best fighters
and I will face them one-by-one.

5
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,083
If I am not defeated,
the Earth belongs to me!

6
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:33,416
[NARRATOR] Viewers worldwide
could do little more than stare

7
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,083
into their television screens,

8
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,875
hoping to wake up
from this horrible dream.

9
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,958
But unfortunately,
the nightmare is real.

10
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:44,041
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

11
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,875
[NARRATOR] The entire planet
is in a state of chaos

12
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:02,333
after Cell's televised
doomsday message.

13
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,458
In every city and every town,
people are gathering up

14
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,791
what they can and
fleeing in terror.

15
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,250
But with Cell on the watch,
don't they realize

16
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,041
that there's nowhere
left to run?

17
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,666
[horns honking]

18
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,875
Hey, what's the hold up?!
Let's move it!

19
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,583
Hurry up before we're all dead!

20
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,041
I've had it!

[OOLONG] Ahhh...

30
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,625
Oh, I wish there was someplace

31
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,916
we could hide until
this blows over!

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,833
B-But there aren't
any safe places left!

33
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:02,041
Chiotzu's right. From what
Cell said in his broadcast,

34
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:06,416
the entire planet is going to be
wiped out after the tournament!

35
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,458
I got it! We borrow
Bulma's ship, orbit the Earth

36
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,458
and then sit back
and watch the fireworks!

37
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,625
Oolong!

38
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:16,750
Yeah... I'd bet ol' Cell
would never think

39
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,875
to look for us up
in outer space!

40
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:23,208
Only a heartless soul would run
and leave his friends behind.

41
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,125
We're in this together.

42
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:30,166
[horns honking]

43
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:41,583
I just had to destroy it...
That was so dumb!

44
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,166
It's all my fault
that this happened!

45
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,458
[KRILLIN] I let Cell take her...

46
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,250
...and I made him complete!

47
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,291
[YAMCHA gasps]

48
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,291
I've gotta stop him!

49
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,333
[ROSHI] Krillin!

50
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,791
Stop right there!

51
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,166
[ROSHI] You know
good and well

52
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,333
that you are no match
for him, Krillin...

53
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:17,791
And I, for one, shall forbid
you to go! Understand?!

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,875
But if you still insist,

55
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,166
then enter his tournament
and face him there.

56
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,083
[YAMCHA] Hey, don't be so
hard on yourself, Krillin.

57
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,666
[ROSHI] Before we do anything,

58
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,125
we should talk to
Goku and Gohan.

59
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:40,916
If anyone is going to stop Cell,
it'll be one of those two.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,958
Let's just hope
they've advanced enough

61
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,041
in their Super Saiyan training.

62
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,416
[TRUNKS] How much longer
are Goku and Gohan

63
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,958
going to be in there?

64
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:03,750
They still have three hours
left to finish off their year.

65
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,083
[VEGETA] I'm sure they'll
stay longer than that!

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,500
They'll do anything
they can to surpass me!

67
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,458
They are training so they
can beat Cell, not you, Vegeta.

68
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:20,375
And there are nine days left,
so you can afford to be patient.

69
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,375
Why don't you rest, Vegeta.

70
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,375
While I go in.

71
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,083
What a waste of time.

72
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,625
You don't actually expect to

73
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,333
become as strong
as a Saiyan, do you?

74
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,083
[PICCOLO growls]

75
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,291
[VEGETA chuckles]

76
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,833
Fine, have your day.

77
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:39,208
But I plan to take the
remaining eight days for myself.

78
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,333
I wouldn't count on that.

79
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,583
Didn't you know you can
only spend two days inside?

80
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,708
Even the Hyperbolic
Time Chamber has its limits.

81
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,375
What?! You lie!

82
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,375
That's ridiculous! 
How gullible do you think I am?!

83
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
[MR. POPO] But it's true.

84
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,541
After 48 hours the
entrance will disappear,

85
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:03,375
and you'll be trapped
inside for eternity.

86
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,541
But Father, there's
plenty of time!

87
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,250

I knew I sensed them, Gohan.

And I can still sense Cell too.
But he seems even stronger.

I can't believe...
how you've changed.

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
[GOKU] So, would someone fill us
in on what's been happening?

98
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,750
Yeah, sure.

99
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,916
Ohh, but before
you start talking,

100

I gotta get something
into my stomach.

good to eat, Mr. Popo?

What I was saying was, is that
Gohan and I can't cook very well

really long time since

00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,791
Yeah, the only conclusion
that makes sense

178
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,875
is that Android 16
was designed

179
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,583
for the sole purpose
of destroying Goku.

180
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,291
But it doesn't seem like
he's after Goku at all...

181
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,541
Or maybe the right opportunity

182
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,083
just hasn't
presented itself yet.

183
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,125
Huh...?

184
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,875
Well, his circuitry is
too complex to really say.

185
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,333
However, he doesn't
look too evil.

186
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,541
[DR. BRIEF] And as I understand,

187
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:09,083
the only aggressive move he's
made has been against Cell.

188
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,333
That's true.

189
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,541
[DR. BRIEF] It really raises
profound questions about

190
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,250
the nature of
artificial intelligence.

191
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,625
Despite all of
Dr. Gero's programming,

192
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,458
this android could
still make a choice.

193
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,041
Yeah... well, I'm glad
he chose to be on our side

194
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,250
at the tournament,

195
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,250
because once we get
finished fixing him up,

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,291
he'll be one of the
strongest players we've got!

197
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:40,708
[GOKU] Hmm... So that's it!

198
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:45,416
A tournament, huh? I gotta
say it sounds interesting.

199
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,833
What? Interesting?

200
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,958
Hey, Mr. Popo, do ya still
have the clothes I left here?

201
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,666
Sure, I do.

202
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,125
They're somewhere.

203
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,625
I even washed them for you.

204
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,416
Hey, thanks. I appreciate that.

205
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,333
I'm sure my mother would make
you some new Saiyan armor

206
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,500
if you asked her.

207
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:25,083
Nah, this'll do fine. I want
to fight as an Earthling.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Piccolo, can I have a new
outfit just like yours?

209
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,083
You were my first teacher.

210
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:39,625
Yeah, kid, it'll make
you look really sharp.

211
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,208
[PICCOLO yells]

212
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:01,833
[GOHAN laughs]

213
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,291
[GOHAN] Wow!

214
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,625
Thank you! It's awesome!

215
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,166
[GOKU] You look great, Gohan.

216
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,750
--Okay.
--Huh?

217
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,541
Kakarot, you think
you can beat Cell now?

218
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,416
Couldn't really tell ya.

219
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,791
I haven't seen him since he
absorbed 18 and transformed.

220
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,750
I'll have to go check him out.

221
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,458
Ahh, Goku.

222
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,541
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,625
Right here, is where the fate of
the universe will be determined.

224
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,875
So what do you think?

225
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,125
[GOKU] I don't know,
seems kind of puny

226
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,208
if it's supposed to
decide all that,

227
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,708
wouldn't you say?

228
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,625
[CELL chuckles]

229
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
[GOKU] You're not
the first person

230
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,416
to try and rule the universe
with a sword of injustice.

231
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,375
They all failed,
and so will you.

232
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:09,166
[thunder crashing]

233
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,041
[GOKU] I've spent months
preparing for the day

234
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,208
I'd face you in
your final form.

235
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,291
I've come a long way, Cell.

236
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,458
So have I.

237
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,208
[PUAR whimpers]

238
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,583
[CHIAOTZU whimpers]

239
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,541
[OOLONG gasps]

240
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,666
What's going on out there?

241
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,208
Is... all that energy
I'm sensing from Cell?

242
00:19:56,291 --> 00:20:01,666
No. There's someone with him,
someone almost as strong...

243
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,916
[BOTH gasp]

244
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,416
[ALL] Goku?!

245
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,708
Huh...?

246
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,500
[KRILLIN laughs]

247
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,541
It must be him!

248
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,791
He's finished, guys!

249
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,666
He's finally out of the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber!

250
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,166
I'll be your first opponent.

251
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,583
So leave everyone out of this
until we meet in the ring.

252
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,208
Agreed?

253
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,333
[CELL] Hmph.

254
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,333
You will pay for your crimes.

255
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,250
Huh?

256
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,250
Well then, Goku.

257
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:14,041
You've just made my little
match even more interesting.

258
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,625
[TRUNKS] So, what did
you think, Goku?

259
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
To be honest, Trunks,

260
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,000
he's become a whole lot
stronger than I thought he'd be!

261
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
[GOHAN gasps]

262
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,666
[GOKU] Of course, I won't
really know how tough he is

263
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
until I see him fight, but...

264
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,791
Well, if I were
to fight him right now,

265
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,625
I'm pretty confident that
he'd beat me into the ground.

266
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,958
Hm?!

267
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:41,125
[BOTH gasp]

268
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,625
[TRUNKS] Oh, okay.
I get it, Goku.

269
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,875
I understand.

270
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,000
He can still can use

271
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,916
the Hyperbolic Time
Chamber once more.

272
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
There is still
plenty of time left

273
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:57,375
and we've decided
to go in first.

274
00:21:57,458 --> 00:22:00,166
Then Vegeta,
who wants to go alone.

275
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,666
That's because I
don't want any of you to

276
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,791
interfere with my training.

277
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:10,666
Well, I... I've decided
not to go in because

278
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,500
I don't think I'd be
a worthy opponent.

279
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,833
Trunks will be next.

280
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:19,625
Followed by Goku and Gohan.
You two will be last.

281
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:28,625
[GOKU] Gohan and I
don't need a turn.

282
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,083
What?!

283
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,916
There's only nine days left,

284
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,875
so I think we'll just
train outside 'til then.

285
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,833
You're not serious?!

286
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,500
[NARRATOR] Goku wants
to train in the outer world.

287
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,791
But will it be enough for
the final battle against Cell?

288
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,750
Find out on the
next exciting episode

289
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:54,166
