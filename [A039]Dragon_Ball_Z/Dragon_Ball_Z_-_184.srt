[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,583
Cell became obsessed
with a new goal.

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:20,583
Having learned of Gohan's
incredible dormant power,

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,208
he was now determined
to bring it out.

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,458
[NARRATOR] It was a painful
process of trial and error,

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,583
as the mighty Cell made
several varied attempts.

7
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,000
[CELL laughs]

00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,416
[NARRATOR] Trapping Gohan
in a powerful death lock,

9
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,083
Cell tried to
lure the boy's power

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,333

12
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,958
[NARRATOR] Goku had been
confident of his son's ability

13
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:45,083
ever since they stepped out of
the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

14
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,083
But as the Saiyan hero
watched his son

15
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,875
being tortured on
the battlefield,

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,125
he realized
he had made a mistake.

17
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:54,583
He would have to step
in and stop Cell himself.

18
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,791
[NARRATOR] But beating
Goku to the punch

19
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,208
was the silent giant Android 16,

20
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,125
whose attempt to stop
Cell was quickly shattered.

21
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,708
along with his metal body.

22
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,666
And seeing Gohan's reaction
to the android's death

23
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,708
gave Cell a new strategy.

24
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:23,958
[CELL] So, Gohan, we still
haven't gotten you mad.

25

friendly persuasion.

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,666

unthinkable happened.

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,583

from his tail

28
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,500

29

With the hopes that
watching his friends in pain

31
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,250
would cause Gohan to
unleash his hidden strength.

00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,833
