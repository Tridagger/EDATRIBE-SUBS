00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,291
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,125
Mr. Popo led Bulma into
the barren reaches

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,458
of Yunzabit Heights,

4
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,250
in search of an
ancient spacecraft

5
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
that had once
belonged to Kami.

6
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,666
When their home
planet was in danger,

7
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,208
Kami's parents must have
put him on board this ship

8
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,541
and sent him here
to save his life.

9
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,125
[BULMA] It must run
by voice command...

10
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,458
But that means all of the
commands are in Namekian!

11
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,833
Let's try it...

12
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,583
See if you can tell it
to fly us to Jupiter...

13
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,666
Topurukuppa Jupe!

14
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,000
[COMPUTER]
Topurukuppa Jupe.

15
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,875
Look, we're here!
We're already at Jupiter!

16
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,000
All right! Now we can
fly this thing to Namek!

17
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:01,083
[NARRATOR] The adventure
continues... today!

18
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:16,041
[welding sounds]

19
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,250
[DR. BRIEF] I kind of feel
a little embarrassed asking,

20
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,708
but do you know
anything about

21
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,000
integrated micro-circuit
feedback loops

22
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,875
and their effect on after
burner ignition rates?

23
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,916
[BULMA] I didn't understand
anything you just said.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,291
So, I guess just
plug stuff in

25
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,083
where it looks like it
fits and hope it works!

26
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,458
[DR. BRIEF]
Right-o!

27
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,000
He's got it all under
control, and don't worry,

28
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,458
it's an awesome ship...

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,000
It took us to Jupiter
in under ten seconds...

30
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,541
Seriously, I blinked,
and we were there.

31
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,416
Can you speak up? I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

32
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,333
I'm talking as loud
as I possibly can!

33
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:47,750
What?

34
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,750
I can't talk now, Krillin.
[welding sounds continue]

35
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,250
I can barely hear
myself think.

36
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,625
But, I'll stop by later...
And we can talk then.

37
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:59,791
[CHICHI humming]

38
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,041
What?

39
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,916
Heh, nothing...
Don't mind me.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,083
[humming continues]

41
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,125
Here.

42
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,875
No...
Thank you.

43
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:21,958
Gohan, eat or you'll
never get better.

44
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,625
Do you want to spend the rest
of your life in a hospital?

45
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,166
No.

46
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,541
Good news... Goku!

47
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
[GOKU] Huh?
[door shuts]

48
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,083
Hey! Bulma said she
found a space ship

49
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,291
to take her to
Planet Namek.

50
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,833
She's already been
to Jupiter and back!

51
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
Her dad's
fixing it up now!

52
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,666
[GOKU]
Sounds great.

53
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,708
[GOHAN groans]

54
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:03,625
[KRILLIN snoring]

55
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,666
[footsteps]

56
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,291
[door opens, closes]

57
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,500
[CHICHI hums]

58
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,750
I thought these might
brighten up the room a bit.

59
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,000
Ah?

60
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,208
My little boy... Mm?

61
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,083
Huh?

62
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,833
[grunts angrily]

63
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,833
[CHICHI] What did you
do with my son?!

64
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,000
What do
you mean?

65
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,375
He's not here,
so where is he?

66
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,791
The last time I saw him, he
was in bed, reading his book.

67
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,333
That poor boy's hurt,
he needs to be in bed.

68
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,791
[grunts angrily]

69
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,083
[KRILLIN whimpers]

70
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,416
[CHICHI] And you just
let him run off!

71
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,833
[KRILLIN and GOKU scream]

72
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,875
Thanks for
the flowers.

73
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,166
[car horns honk]

74
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,916
[GOHAN grunts]

75
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,791
Yow!

76
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,291
[GOHAN screams]

77
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,208
[GOHAN sighs]

78
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,458
That was...
a close one.

79
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,000
Gohan!

80
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,083
Surely he couldn't
go too far.

81
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,208
The doctor said his
legs were so weak.

82
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,541
I hope he doesn't
overexert himself!

83
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:41,708
[GOHAN grunting]

84
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:50,000
Here goes.

85
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:02,541
See, I knew
I felt better.

86
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,500
[CHICHI] Gohan!

87
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,416
Gohan!

88
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,125
Gohan!

89
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,625
I've been looking
all over for you.

90
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,041
Oh, hi Mom...

91
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,666
I, uh, thought some fresh
air would do me some good,

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,333
so I came up
here to read.

93
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,000
You had me
worried sick!

94
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,583
[GOHAN yells]

95
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,625
Hop on and we'll
go back to the room.

96
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:32,000
But... I can walk...
I feel fine.

97
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,833
[CHICHI]
Don't be silly.

98
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:37,166
Now, chop, chop... 
Come on, Gohan.

99
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:45,791
There... See? That's
not so bad, now is it?

100
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,666
[BULMA] If the ship holds
up like I think it will...

101
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,041
Then we could easily make
it to the Planet Namek

102
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,708
in less than a
month's time...

103
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,875
I still have a few
repairs to make.

104
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,875
But I'd say we could leave
within the next five days.

105
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,250
Wonderful luck.

106
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,875
I thought we'd
never find a way

107
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,041
to get the Dragon Balls.
Great job!

108
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,250
Yes, congratulations, Bulma.
You've saved the day.

109
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,750
Well, Mr. Popo
found the ship.

110
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:13,250
And with his help, I'll find
the Dragon Balls in no time!

111
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,541
Huh? But, Bulma,
I can't go with you.

112
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,875
[BULMA] What?

113
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,791
I'm really sorry, Bulma,
but I can't go and abandon

114
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:22,416
the Lookout for two
months... I can't.

115
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,750
But you're the only person
I know who can speak Namek,

116
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,125
and how am I going to
start the ship without you?

117
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,750
You know, this entire mission
was counting on you!

118
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,333
You can't
just back out!

119
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm sorry...
I have to stay here.

120
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,833
[BULMA gasps]

121
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:40,333
[KRILLIN] Don't worry, Bulma,
we'll figure something out!

122
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,708
I'm sure Mr. Popo can teach
you the Namekian words

123
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,041
you need to use
the computer!

124
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,166
I guess... It shouldn't
be too hard to grasp.

125
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,291
But, I don't wanna
go all by myself.

126
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,125
So who's gonna come
along to keep me company?

127
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,125
Hey, let's not everyone
volunteer at once.

128
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,791
I thought you
were my friends.

129
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,750
I am your friend,
but there's no way

130
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,083
you're getting me
in that tin can.

131
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,083
Yeah, like she was
really hoping you'd go.

132
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,000
[ROSHI] Ahem.

133
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,375
Two months alone
with Bulma...

134
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:11,583
Sign me up!

135
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,875
It'll be the trip of
a lifetime, I promise!

136
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,291
You better watch
yourself, old man!

137
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,583
Goku can't make it either...
That leaves you.

139
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,125
Krillin, will
you go with me?

140
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,458
It's not that I don't
want to help...

141
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,250
But I need 
training...

142
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,291
We could be attacked
again at any moment...

143
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,416
And I want to be
ready next time.

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,916
Krillin... You can't
pass this up...

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,333
It would be a great
opportunity for training

146
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,458
once you get
to Planet Namek.

147
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,416
Alright, I'll go,
but when I get back,

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,166
I wanna see you in perfect
fighting mode again, Goku.

149
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,000
[GOKU] Don't worry about me.
I'll be out of here in no time.

150
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
Hey... Guys?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,708
[CHICHI] What's wrong, Gohan?
Do you have a tummy ache?

152
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,125
[GOHAN groans]

153
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,125
I want to go with
Bulma and Krillin!

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,333
Wait a minute, Gohan...

155
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,416
You... don't wanna leave
me alone for two months.

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,958
But, Mom, Dad will
be here with you...

157
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,958
And... I really want
to go with them.

158
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,333
I... can't believe
what I'm hearing...

159
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,250
You'd rather go with
them than stay with me?!

160
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:32,916
Sorry, mom... But...
I really need to...

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,541
...try to help
bring Piccolo back.

162
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,833
ChiChi... Aw, let him go.

163
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,958
[CHICHI] I can't take
this anymore! I swear!

164
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,458
Why couldn't I have
a normal family

165
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,083
that sits down
and eats dinner?!

166
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,125
And talks about
their day!

167
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,083
And then maybe watches
some TV and goes to bed.

168
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,291
[ROSHI] You better find
a safe spot to stand in...

169
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,500
[GOHAN]
Don't be silly, Mom.

170
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,666
[CHICHI] I'm silly?
My son tells me I'm silly?!

171
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,916
I'm not the one who wants to
run around and be a superhero!

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,958
[GOHAN] Bulma, you'll take
me with you, won't you?

173
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:08,958
[CHICHI]
That's it!

174
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,791
I'm putting my
foot down, Gohan!

175
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,958
I won't let you leave me again.
You just came home!

176
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,500
After you had been gone
for a whole year, Gohan!

177
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,541
You're a child!
Act like one!

178
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:19,916
Don't throw away
your childhood

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,625
trying so hard to
be a brave adult!

180
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,875
Being a kid's the
best part of life!

181
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,375
You should be making friends
and playing baseball!

182
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,500
Not trying to
save the world!

183
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,041
I'm going!

184
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:33,291
[KRILLIN and ROSHI whimpering]

185
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,541
How did I raise such
a stubborn child?

186
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:43,500
There's no time for those
childish things, anymore.

187
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,750
My friends are gone, and
they're not coming back.

188
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,250
[GOHAN] I've got to help
find the Dragon Balls.

189
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,333
Mom, Piccolo died
trying to help me,

190
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,541
so I think I should do
everything I can to help him.

191
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:58,291
I can't sit around and do
nothing while Piccolo needs me.

192
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,750
I'm sorry I
yelled at you, Mom.

193
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:06,791
But I have to try...
You see, they're my friends.

194
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:07,750
[YAJIROBE chuckling]

195
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,166
Pretty good speech, kid.

196
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,541
You sure didn't learn
that from your father.

197
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,125
[OX KING]
Don't worry, ChiChi.

198
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916
[OX KING] You have
a brave son there.

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,541
I'm sure he'll make
it back just fine.

200
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,166
[thinking]
That's my boy, Gohan...

201
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,583
Go show 'em what
you're made of.

202
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,041
I promise to keep an eye on
him at all times, ChiChi.

203
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,125
Nothing will happen
to your little boy.

204
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,500
[BULMA] And besides,
Krillin will be there, too.

205
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,208
Do you think you can learn
Namekian in five days?

206
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,666
Don't know... It could
take me a while longer

207
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,333
to input all the information
into the translator...

208
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,166
Hey... How 'bout we
meet up in ten days?

209
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,083
Sure.

210
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:21,166
On Namek,
hello is "Piconat".

211
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,708
[BULMA] "Picanot".

212
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,833
[COMPUTER beeping]

213
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,291
You get a clean
bill of health.

214
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,041
[KRILLIN screams]

215
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,791
[ALL laughing]

216
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,958
Aren't you
finished yet?

217
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,416
Be patient... Even
superheroes have to spend

218
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,791
some quality time
with their moms.

219
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,041
[CHICHI] It's time to
take your medicine.

220
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,541
I'll get
some water.

221
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,583
Give it a try.

222
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,416
Here goes.

223
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:47,333
Don't hold
back, Gohan...

224
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,250
I need to see if
you're really okay.

225
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,125
Okay.

226
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,458
[GOHAN] Hyaah!

227
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,916
Good... I think
you're ready, Gohan.

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,208
You sure made a
quick recovery.

229
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,833
But then again, I had
no doubt you would.

230
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,708
You've gotten
so strong!

231
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,333
[NARRATOR]
After ten stressful days

232
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:27,291
preparing for
the long journey,

233
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,458
the group gathered on
Master Roshi's island

234
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,750
to say their goodbyes and
set out for Planet Namek.

235
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,875
[KRILLIN]
I don't know...

236
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,333
You sure this
thing can make it

237
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,708
there and back in one piece?
It doesn't look very big.

238
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,583
[BULMA] It'll get
the job done, Krillin.

239
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,750
[BULMA] And besides,
if I were you,

240
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,541
I wouldn't be complaining
about a free ride.

241
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,250
You're lucky I'm gonna
let you sit up front.

242
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,416
You were going in
with the luggage.

243
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,375
[KRILLIN laughing nervously]

244
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,166
You think I'm
joking, but I'm not.

245
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,208
Did you do something with your
hair? Looks really good.

246
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,166
[BULMA] And don't try to win me
over with cheap compliments.

247
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,916
No, I mean it!

248
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,625
Well, thanks... I cut it
to fit in my space helmet.

249
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,625
That reminds me...

250
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:14,000
I wanted to ask you if I'm
gonna need a space suit.

251
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,500
'Cause I don't
have one.

252
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,291
It's not something people keep
in their closet, you know.

253
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,125
You'll be fine
without it.

254
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:23,375
Look! There's Gohan now!

255
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Sorry we're late...

256
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,208
It took a while to
get all packed up,

257
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,750
but you wouldn't believe
how much stuff we've brought.

258
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,083
I hope you have
enough room in there.

259
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,416
This thing doesn't
look that big.

260
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:05,416
Come on, Gohan... Everyone's
out here waiting for you.

261
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,916
What's wrong, Gohan?
Why won't you come out?

262
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,000
[ALL gasp]

263
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,750
Are you feeling okay?
You sure you want to go?

264
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,625
[GOHAN] Mm-hmm...

265
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:32,833
[KRILLIN laughing]

266
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,000
I worried about not
having a space suit...

267
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,541
At least I don't have to
wear a little uniform.

268
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:41,666
Yeah... Dad thought I
looked pretty funny, too.

269
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know why.

270
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,708
I think it makes him look
like the cutest thing...

271
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,125
Well, don't you
think so, Gohan?

272
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:51,166
[KRILLIN] So, what's
with all this stuff?

273
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,583
Here's his
underwear, toothbrush,

274
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,250
coloring book,
and sleep mask.

275
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,166
And here's some snacks for
the trip and his medicine.

276
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,541
And we have
a hairdryer,

277
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:01,125
full dinner set with
salad and dinner forks, multi--

278
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,125
I think we
get the picture.

279
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,083
Can we go now?
This suit is heavy...

280
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,458
I'm looking forward
to zero gravity.

281
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,750
Careful out there...

282
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,625
You never know what
you might come up against.

283
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,083
Right.

284
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,333
Piccolo.

285
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,208
Bye, Grandpa...
Bye, Mom...

286
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,083
Bye, Master Roshi...
Bye, Turtle!

287
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,875
We'll be back. And
hopefully with our friends.

288
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,250
Piccolo.

289
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:51,375
[OX KING] Don't get
in too much trouble!

290
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,166
Bye, Gohan.
Mommy loves you!

291
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,083
Bye!

292
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,333
Wow, it's nice.
I'm impressed.

293
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,791
So, where should
I put this?

294
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,083
You said there was
a luggage compartment.

295
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,916
Just throw it in the
corner and sit down...

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,708
I'd hold on
to something.

297
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,500
What's wrong Bulma?
Are you mad?

298
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,208
No, I'm just
ready to leave...

299
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,791
We're departing
in five seconds.

300
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,791
Wait, Bulma, we're
not strapped in yet!

301
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:37,833
[BULMA]
5... 4... 3... 2... 1!

302
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:46,083
Uh, guys, I think we might have
left my stomach back on Earth.

303
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,458
I'm starting to wish you
stayed back there with it.

304
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,083
[ROSHI] I'm sure they'll
have a great time.

305
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,541
Namek must be a
beautiful place.

306
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:02,708
Bye, Gohan... Come
back to me safely.

307
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,750
It'll be smooth
sailing from here...

308
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,125
And now that we're
on autopilot,

309
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,791
how about cleaning
up this mess?!

310
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,541
Sure, Bulma.

311
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,708
[GOHAN] I can't even see
the Earth anymore.

312
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,375
[KRILLIN] Where you
going, Bulma?

313
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,208
I'll be right back...
I'm just going to change.

314
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:46,750
You mean you made yourself a
space suit just for take-off?

315
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,583
Man, I was only
trying to make a joke.

316
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,000
I guess we better start
cleaning up... Ready?

317
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,125
Give me a minute.
I need to change first.

318
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,583
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea...

319
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:01,958
What was your
mom thinking?

320
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,541
Sometimes I think
she really is crazy.

321
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,250
[GOHAN] It's all right.

322
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:12,958
[GOHAN] I packed my own clothes
when my Mom wasn't looking.

323
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,791
[GOHAN laughing]

324
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,166
[KRILLIN] You really do respect
Piccolo, don't you?

325
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,708
Yeah... About as
much as I do my dad.

326
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,166
[door clacking open]

327
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,791
So... Did you make that
outfit yourself, too?

328
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,416
You look tough.

329
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,250
Good, but I'm trying
to look mean...

330
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,583
I've had just about enough
of your wisecracks, Krillin.

331
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,041
So from now on we're going
by a whole new set of rules.

332
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,708
[BULMA laughing maniacally]

333
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,875
Uh-oh... I don't think I
like the sound of that much.

334
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,250
[thinking]
Good luck, Gohan.

335
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,750
[NARRATOR] Everyone is
counting on the young group

336
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,833
of adventurers to return
safely from their mission...

337
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,541
[NARRATOR] But they have
a vast distance to cross

338
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,750
before they reach
their destination,

339
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:49,791
and many unknown dangers
to face along the way!

340
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:54,875
Don't miss the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
