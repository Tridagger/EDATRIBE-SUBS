00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,875
Goku transformed himself
into a Super Saiyan 3,

3
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,458
stunning his opponents,

4
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,375
the evil wizard Babidi and his
forceful henchman, Majin Buu,

5
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,666
with his uncanny
strength and ability.

6
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,333
It seemed as though the monster
had finally met his match

7
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,250
in the form of
the Super Saiyan 3.

8
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,375
But even at this
intense power level,

9
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,875
Goku could not
topple Majin Buu.

10
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,500
Although for the time being,

11
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,916
absolute victory
was not Goku's goal.

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,750
[GOKU thinking]
What's taking Trunks so long?

13
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,208
I can't go on fighting
like this forever.

14
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,708
My energy's draining fast,

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,500
and Majin Buu just keeps
coming back for more!

16
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,958
[NARRATOR] The Saiyan just
needed to stall Majin Buu

17
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:54,875
while Trunks searched for
his mother's Dragon Radar.

18
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,708
[TRUNKS]
Hey, here it is! I found it!

19
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,833
Well, that's just
wonderful, Trunks.

20
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,750
Now, we all have
time for a relaxing lunch.

21
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,416
What is it with you and food?
Gotta go, love ya!

22
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,083
[GOKU thinking]
There he is. Good.

23
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,083
He's on his way
back to the Lookout.

24
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,333
He must've finally
found the Dragon Radar.

25
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,250
I guess it's time to
wrap up my business here

26
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,791
so I can head back, too.

27
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,333
[NARRATOR]
With Goku's task complete,

28
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,333
he powered down
to his normal state,

29
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,875
and bid adieu to
Babidi and Majin Buu.

30
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,958
[GOKU]
See ya.

31
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:33,125
[BUU]
Huh? Uh? Huh?

32
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,625
Don't just stand there floating.

33
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:38,458
Get your doughy pink body moving
and find him right now!

34
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,458
[NARRATOR] But Majin Buu had had
enough of being bossed around

35
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,125
and abused by Babidi.

36
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,916
The time had come for a mutiny.

37
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,875
[BUU] You teach me
lots of good things,

38
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:55,916
but Buu think it time
Babidi go bye-bye-bye.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,333
[NARRATOR] Now there's a new
master of evil on the loose,

40
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,958
and he's angry!

41
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,500
[BUU]
Bye! Bye!

42
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,875
[BABIDI screams]

43
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:25,541
[BUU] You go bye-bye now!
Bye-bye, Babidi!

44
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,875
No more tell Buu what
to do! No more meanie!

45
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,791
Pull!

46
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,666
Ha, ha!

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,958
[cackles]

48
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,375
Woo! Ha, ha!

49
00:04:55,458 --> 00:05:00,125
[cheering]

50
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:05,208
What's the matter?
What's wrong, Dad?

51
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,041
Goku, what is it you're sensing?

52
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:12,750
[GOKU]
It's Majin Buu. He's-He's...

53
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,416
[PICCOLO]
He's what?

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,166
He's killed Babidi.

55
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,041
[GOTEN, KRILLIN gasp]

56
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,166
He killed him?!

57
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,333
Well, this is quite a
surprising turn of events.

58
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,958
I had a feeling that he might.

59
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,958
They didn't really
seem to get along.

60
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:29,000
So, what happens now?

61
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,583
Majin Buu has no one telling
him what to do anymore.

62
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,958
There's no denying that Babidi
was definitely the brains

63
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,125
of that particular operation.

64
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,333
[sighs] Maybe things will
turn out happy after all, guys!

65
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,916
Yeah!

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
I'm not so sure.

67
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,416
The only thing
we can do now is hope.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,666
I promise, give them two days
and they'll be ready to fight.

69
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,875
There's no need for
you to destroy West City

70
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,458
or kill anyone else.

71
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,375
I'm asking, have some patience.
They'll come to you.

72
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,708
Are they really strong?

73
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,625
Unbelievably.

74
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,541
[GOKU thinking]
We can only hope.

75
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,875
[BUU] Buu so free! Buu so free!
Like bird in no cage.

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,833
[laughs]

77
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,791
So free!

78
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,583
[BUU]
What do Buu do first?

79
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,041
Buu have so much fun now!

80
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:30,041
No more Babidi tell
Buu what to do.

81
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,458
Over there! Look fun!

82
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,666
Look like fun! Look like fun!

83
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,833
Over there! Fun!

84
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,041
Huh?

85
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,166
[yelps]

86
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,500
[DRIVER] Hey! Watch where
you're goin', hot shot!

87
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,916
It's Majin Buu!!

88
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,458
[BUU thinking] This make
Buu happy. Verry happy!

89
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:03,541
They look much like toys!
Buu like to play with toys!

90
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:10,750
[inhales]

91
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:16,958
[screams]

92
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,791
[BUU giggles]

93
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,708
[inhales]

94
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:33,625
[CROWD screams]

95
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,750
[BUU]
You go, Buu!

96
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,083
[laughs]

97
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,083
[CROWD screams]

98
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:09,583
[CROWD murmuring]

99
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,125
[BUU]
Ready?

100
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,500
Set!

101
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,708
[can rattling]

102
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:23,791
[CROWD murmuring]

103
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,208
Go!

104
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:35,000
[BUU giggling, cackling]

105
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,375
[laughs]

106
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,583
[laughs]

107
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:51,333
Hm?

108
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:52,291
[shrieks]

109
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,375
P-Please!

110
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:56,833
Ooh!

111
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,000
[shrieks]

112
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,958
Help! Somebody, please
help me! It's Buu!

113
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,791
P-Please, don't hurt me!

114
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,875
Hello girl, you think Buu sexy?

115
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:09,416
[yelps] What? Yes, I think
you're very, very sexy!

116
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,041
Yay! Then give Buu smooch!

117
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,541
[screams]

118
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,125
Why you teasing Buu?!

119
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,083
--[screams]
--You play with Buu feelings!

120
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,583
[BUU]
Hm... What this?

121
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,708
So, Earth girls like boys
pretty like this, huh?

122
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,916
How Buu s'posed live up
to body image in magazine?

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,333
Ah, Buu know!

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,875
[gulps]

125
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,458
Baby!

126
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,500
[screams]

127
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,791
Oh no! Get away!

128
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,500
You girls don't
know what you want!

129
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,000
How do you like candy?!

130
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:55,291
[screams]

131
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,000
[BUU]
Mm-mm-mm!

132
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,000
Ah! Yes, yes. Very nice!

133
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,500
Buu like girls!

134
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,416
Buu so great!
Now, do a flip! Ha, ha!

135
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,666
Boom! Boom!

136
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,000
[BUU cackles]

137
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,916
Buu can't wait to
play with the strong guys!

138
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:38,041
That whole city! This is bad!

139
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,166
[growls]

140
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,125
He's even worse without Babidi!

141
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:44,541
[GOKU] Hmm. I guess it's just in
his nature to cause destruction.

142
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,291
It's probably the only
thing he's ever known to do.

143
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,541
No! Don't go making
excuses for him.

144
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,416
There's no reason
to demolish planets,

145
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,875
regardless of
personality defects.

146
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,541
Don't worry, I'm fairly certain

147
00:10:56,625 --> 00:11:00,083
we can keep him from
wiping out the entire planet.

148
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,666
Buu seemed very
eager when I told him

149
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,083
stronger fighters
than me would be

150
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,125
facing off against
him in two days. So...

151
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,625
...that buys us some time.
But I can't help feeling bad

152
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,875
for all the innocent people down
there who stand in his way.

153
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,208
But we can bring
everything back to normal

154
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,791
with the Dragon Balls, right?

155
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,041
Perhaps, Krillin, but that
doesn't do us any good

156
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,458
if the boys aren't prepared
to fuse and defeat Majin Buu

157
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,708
in these next two days.

158
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:23,833
[GOTEN]
Hm?

159
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,458
[PICCOLO]
That should be our priority.

160
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,041
You and the boys are going
to have to learn fast, Piccolo.

161
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
My time here on
Earth is running out.

162
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,083
I have less than an hour.

163
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,583
Less than an hour?!

164
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,041
No, you must have
more than that.

165
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,208
It hasn't been a full day yet.

166
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,083
Why do you have to
leave so soon, Dad?

167
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,875
Please don't. I like you.

168
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,333
I like you too, Goten,
but it seems Super Saiyan 3

169
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:53,416
is a level that can only be
handled in Other World.

170
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,750
The living world has more
rules than Other World,

171
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,500
and transforming
takes too much energy.

172
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,750
So I got very, very tired.

173
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,625
Oh no! So that's why you
seem so exhausted, huh?

174
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,250
A little fatigue and energy loss

175
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,250
is nothing Dende
can't take care of.

176
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:15,916
No I can't. For this I have
to return to the Other World.

[BABA]
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

178
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,458
Greetings, Goku. At the tone,

179
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,333
your time remaining on this
Earth will be 30 minutes.

180
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:32,166
Baba, what are you--
Thirty minutes?! Ah!

181
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,458
Is that all the time I've got?

182
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:38,916
[BABA]
At the tone, Goku -- beeeeeep!

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,833
Trunks had better hurry up.
There's no time!

184
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,750
[TRUNKS thinking]
Trunks is on the way, guys!

185
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:15,833
[GOHAN grunting]

186
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,375
[GOHAN thinking] The sword
is an extension of my body.

187
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,958
Feel the sword.

188
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,333
Be the sword.

189
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:27,125
[grunting]

190
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:40,000
[grunting]

191
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,208
Don't hurt yourself, Gohan!

192
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,875
[panting]

193
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,875
Incredible!

194
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,750
Gohan's natural ability
to handle the Z Sword

195
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,416
with such finesse is uncanny.

196
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,125
I've never seen anything
quite like it, Master.

197
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,916
What did I tell you, Kibito?
Gohan is the one!

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,208
Everything is going exactly
according to my plan.

199
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,791
Soon enough, Gohan will
be ready to slay Majin Buu,

200
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,125
and restore order
to the universe.

201
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:30,333
[panting]

202
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:33,250
Don't wear yourself out, Gohan.
Rest for a few minutes.

203
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,041
You've done so much,
more than I even dared hope.

204
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,291
No, I still have
a long way to go.

205
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,750
Huh?

206
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,458
[GOHAN thinking]
I won't let them down again.

207
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,041
I may have been unprepared
for Majin Buu before,

208
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,000
but I refuse to be
defeated by him this time.

209
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,500
It's gonna take
everything I've got,

210
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,375
but I'm willing to
give that and then some.

211
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,000
I just hope that's enough.

212
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,083
Until then, all I
can do is practice.

213
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:15,583
[KRILLIN, GOTEN grunting]

214
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,666
Goku, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

215
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,458
Go ahead.

216
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,375
When you went
Super Saiyan 3...

217
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:26,083
Would it have been possible?

218
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:29,750
Could you have actually defeated
Majin Buu once and for all,

219
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,125
if you really tried?

220
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,916
Well, I don't know.

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,500
I mean you have to
admit that Majin Buu

222
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:38,083
is no ordinary opponent.

223
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,000
It might have been
impossible for me to win.

224
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,166
Might?! Why didn't
you at least try to

225
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,041
give him everything
that you had?

226
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,583
Were you afraid of
what would happen

227
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,791
if your body was
destroyed on Earth?

228
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,166
No.

229
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,208
By all accounts,

230
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,375
I shouldn't even
be here in this world.

231
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
It's not my place to do that.

232
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,875
This is their world, Piccolo.

233
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,208
Even if I did somehow
defeat Majin Buu,

234
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:13,083
he wouldn't be the last villain
to terrorize the Earth.

235
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,541
And then who would be
prepared to save them?

236
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,041
Call me crazy,

237
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,041
but after watching those
boys fight each other

238
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:27,250
at the Junior Division,
I decided to take a chance.

239
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,125
[PICCOLO] So you're going
to wager the world's future

240
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,458
on the shoulders
of little children?

241
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,583
[GOKU] I think it's a
pretty safe bet, don't you?

242
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,666
You've always been a
hopeless dreamer, Goku.

243
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,541
Goku, I'm sorry.

244
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:56,125
Well, give him my regards when
you see him in the Other World.

245
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,000
[GOKU] I'm sure that Gohan
misses you very much, too.

246
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,583
He was always fond of you.

247
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,500
[GOKU] You were like
family to him, Piccolo.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,791
Hey! Heads up, guys!
Trunks just flew in!

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,666
It's so good to see my little
Trunks. You must be tired.

250
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,291
Mom! I'm fine.

251
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,208
[BULMA] Of course you are,
dear. You're so grown up.

252
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,333
Here it is, sir! Confirm:
Is this your Dragon Radar?!

253
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,833
Confirmed! Good job, soldier.
Mission accomplished.

254
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:35,041
Thank you, sir!

255
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,333
Great! Now, thanks to Trunks

256
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,833
we can track down
the Dragon Balls

257
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,333
and wish for everything
to be brought back to normal.

258
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,208
When do we get to
train for the fusion?

259
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:46,083
You guys didn't start
without me, did you?

260
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:51,250
Of course we didn't.
It takes two to fuse.

261
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,625
Ooh! Ooh! Wouldn't it be cool
if I could fusion with myself

262
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,583
and become two of me? Huh, Dad?

263
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,125
[GOKU chuckles]

264
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,958
[laughs]

265
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,916
[GOKU, GOTEN, TRUNKS laugh]

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,708
[TRUNKS]
I don't get it.

267
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,166
[GOKU] Goten! Trunks! We have to
begin our training right away.

268
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,875
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes, sir!

269
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,833
[GOKU] Now, I don't
have much time left,

270
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,875
so we're going to need
to work hard and fast.

271
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,833
The fate of the world depends
on your cooperation. Got it?

272
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,541
[BOTH]
Sir, yes, sir!

273
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,708
Wow! What do you
think got into them?

274
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,583
Well, maybe you
can teach these kids

275
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,125
some new tricks after all, Goku.

276
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,208
Let's begin!

277
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,333
First, you two have to realign
your energies with one another.

278
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,708
[GOTEN, TRUNKS]
Yes, sir!

279
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,166
Buu!

280
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,291
Target has been located
and confirmed, Major.

281
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,458
This operation should
be a piece of cake.

282
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,666
Preparing to launch missiles

283
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,041
once we get that freak
in our cross-hairs.

284
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,500
Lock and load!

285
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,250
[BUU laughs]

286
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,291
Abort! Abort!

287
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,916
Buu want to play! Don't you
want to play with Buu?

288
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,041
Okay, I think, uh, we managed
to lose him back there--

289
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:14,750
Huh?

290
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,291
[screams]

291
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,166
[BUU]
Peek-a-Buu!

292
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,208
That tickles!

293
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,833
[whimpering]

00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:44,583
--Buu!

Wa-hoo-hoo!

297
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,041
Toys don't last long as used to.

298
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:08,750
[GOTEN, TRUNKS yelling]

299
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
It's amazing how great
their powers are,

300
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
especially at
such a young age, wow!

301
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,916
Trunks, Mommy's proud of you!

302
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,375
[GOTEN, TRUNKS yelling]

303
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,791
Great!

304
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,958
Your energies are perfectly
matched. Just keep practicing,

305
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,375
otherwise you'll slip out
of sync with each other.

306
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,250
Hey, you don't look so good,
Goku. Even for you.

307
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:40,375
Thanks, but I'll be all right.
Just a little tired.

308
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,458
Yeah, it's nothing, really.

309
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,125
[PICCOLO thinking] I've never
seen Goku so weak before.

310
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,958
That Super Saiyan 3
transformation

311
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,041
must have really taken its toll.

312
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,541
[GOKU grunts]

313
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,916
Now, are you ready to attempt

314
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,625
the most difficult
part of fusion?

315
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,250
It'll require
a lot of patience,

316
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,833
and some real discipline.

317
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,458
--Well, yeah!
--Yes!

318
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,500
Once you've matched
your energies precisely,

319
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,375
you must strike a delicate
series of poses together.

320
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,958
If either one of you is
even the slightest bit off,

321
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,458
the fusion will fail.

322
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,125
Now, I'm about to teach
you the exact moves.

323
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,416
So, pay close attention, 'kay?

324
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes!

325
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:20,000
Yes!

326
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,458
To get it started,

327
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,083
the two of you will stand
right next to each other.

328
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,375
Then go like this,

329
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,833
and make sure your arms
are straight. Then you say:

330
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,875
Fu... You'll approach each
other with outstretched arms,

331
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,708
moving exactly three steps over,

332
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,958
and once you got that you say...

333
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,333
...sion!

334
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,875
Quarter turn and watch
the angle of your knee.

335
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,291
Ha!

336
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,750
Now watch! Point your
fingers parallel,

337
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:51,000
and don't forget the angle of
your legs! It's very important.

338
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,875
This might be a bit tough.

339
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:11,000
[BUU]
Boooooooooooom!

340
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,291
[NARRATOR] Without anyone
to keep him under leash,

341
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:24,875
Majin Buu has become even
more dangerous than before!

342
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,125
Now, it's your turn
to try, boys!

343
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,375
[BOTH]
Yes!

344
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:34,125
[NARRATOR] Can Goten and
Trunks really master

345
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,958
the complex art of fusion

346
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,833
before Goku has to
return to Other World?

347
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,041
They'll have to,

348
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,708
if there's any hope
