1
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,041
[NARRATOR] Last time
on DragonBall Z,

2
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:19,416
Trunks and Cell pushed their
powers to incredible new levels.

3
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,166
And you'll be the first to see

4
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,583
the true power
of the Saiyan race!

5
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,166
[TRUNKS yells]

6
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:35,583
[NARRATOR] Trunks beefed up
his body and ascended to a

7
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,208
level never before
seen on planet Earth.

8
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:42,000
As his muscles bulged and raw
power pumped through his veins,

9
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,208
the sinister android
watched silently.

10
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,000
Trunks may have become
stronger than Vegeta,

11
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,833
but he hasn't won yet.

12
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,291
[TRUNKS yells]

13
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,458
[NARRATOR] The biggest
challenge of Trunks' life

14
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,041
stands before him.

15
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,750
And the Saiyan from the future
shows no signs of backing down.

16
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,500
[NARRATOR] After a slew
of well-delivered punches,

17
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:14,541
Trunks proved that he
was a force not to be ignored.

18
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:18,541
With fierce determination, he
hammered Cell into the ground.

19
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,500
[NARRATOR] But still,
Cell laughed.

20
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,666
[CELL chuckles]

21
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,375
Impressive, I must admit
you have exceeded me, Trunks.

22
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:40,541
At least in the area
of brute strength.

23
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:48,625
And yet you have absolutely
no chance of defeating me!

24
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,666
[TRUNKS] Listen to yourself!
What kind of logic is that?!

25
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,583
Oh, you'll see...

26
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,625
[CELL chuckles]

27
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,791
[NARRATOR] What could he mean?
Find out today!

28
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,500
[TRUNKS growls]

29
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,041
[CELL chuckles]

30
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,500
[TRUNKS growls]

31
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,625
[ANDROID 16 thinking] Where does
he get his strength from?

32
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:49,166
[TRUNKS yells]

33
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,791
[yelling continues]

34
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:16,458
Not bad, Trunks. But give up.
You just can't beat me.

35
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:21,916
[TRUNKS growls]

36
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:28,833
[VEGETA grunts]

37
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,166
What's wrong!?
Vegeta, are you okay?

38
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,125
[VEGETA grunts]

39
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,708
[KRILLIN] Hang in there.

40
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,041
I gotta find a safe place
to set you down.

41
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,375
That island over there
will have to do!

42
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,833
[KRILLIN] Vegeta,
can you hear me?

43
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,375
Hey, come on... wake up...

44
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,375
Take this. It's a Senzu bean.

45
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,916
Hey, Vegeta! You okay?

46
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,375
[VEGETA] Cell!

47
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,291
[VEGETA growls]

48
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:24,333
[TRUNKS growls]

49
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:33,833
[growling continues]

50
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,166
[CELL chuckles]

51
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,083
Trunks... He's so powerful.

52
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,875
He's even stronger than
Cell now. It's incredible!

53
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,041
[BULMA] Hey, guys?
What's going on?

54
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:01,375
A little play-by-play for
those of us in the cheap seats

55
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,583
would really be
appreciated, you know?

56
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,041
Trunks is big
and strong, alright?!

57
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:10,541
Trunks? Oh, of course!
I'm so proud of my little boy!

58
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,625
[TRUNKS growls]

59
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,583
[TRUNKS yells]

60
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,333
[CELL chuckles]

61
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,416
[GOKU] Okay, Gohan! When you're
ready, show me what you can do!

62
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,166
[GOHAN growls]

63
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,833
[GOHAN thinking] I've got
to focus my emotions better!

64
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,750
This has to get easier!

65
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,208
[GOHAN grunts]

66
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,750
[GOKU] Hmm...?

67
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:09,333
Whoa... He's really starting
to get the hang of it.

68
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,708
That's my boy! He's going
to be a great warrior someday.

69
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,208
[GOHAN thinking]
What is my Dad doing?

70
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:26,208
He's been just sitting there
watching me for days.

71
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,666
I guess he's trying to
figure out how to ascend

72
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,500
to the next level.

73
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,875
It must be really tough.

74
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,833
[GOHAN grunts]

75
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:42,791
[GOHAN sighs]

76
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,333
[GOKU] Gohan, watch me.

77
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
[GOKU yells]

78
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:09,666
[yelling continues]

79
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,625
[GOHAN gasps]

80
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,750
He did it!

81
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,500
[GOHAN] Dad! You did it!

82
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,166
Your power...
It's huge! You did it!

83
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,583
You ascended to the next level.

84
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:39,041
I could go one step
further if I wanted to.

85
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:45,041
[GOKU yells]

86
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,958
[GOHAN whimpers]

87
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,333
Yeah, that's it!

88
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:12,166
Wow! You're more than a Super
Saiyan now! You're the greatest!

89
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,708
Nobody can beat you!
I know you can beat Cell!

90
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,375
[GOKU thinking] No, this
new form has a weakness.

91
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,833
[TRUNKS growls]

92
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,208
[CELL chuckles]

93
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:34,000
[CELL]
You're too slow, Trunks.

94
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,208
You'll have to do
better than that.

95
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:42,250
Cell! Darn him! I can't
hit him. Why can't I hit him?!

96
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,208
[CELL] What a
disappointment you are!

97
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:52,208
You're so pathetic, I can't even
test my complete power on you.

98
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,500
What?!

99
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:57,416
[TRUNKS yells]

100
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,541
[CELL chuckles]

101
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,583
[TRUNK grunts]

102
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,416
[TRUNKS grunts]

103
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,333
[blows landing,
TRUNKS grunting]

104
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,791
[CELL] Are you finished yet?
Or are you going to get up

105
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,708
and entertain me some more?

106
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:46,666
[CELL chuckles]

107
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,416
[CELL] Get up or I will
put you down permanently!

108
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,916
[CELL chuckles]

109
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,458
That's it!

110
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,500
[TRUNKS growls]

111
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:23,333
You're wasting your strength!

112
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,125
[TRUNKS grunts]

113
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,166
I told you before,
you can't beat me.

114
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,125
[TRUNKS growls]

115
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,500
[TRUNKS snarls]

116
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,583
[TRUNKS thinking] I can't even
hit him! I don't understand!

117
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,916
I've powered up so much.
Why can't I touch him?

118
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:36,208
[GOHAN] You can beat Cell!
You can! I know you can!

119
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:41,166
Not in this form, not yet.

120
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,166
What? Why not, Dad?

121
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,791
[GOKU] I know I look
like I can, Gohan.

122
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,791
But these bulky muscles
make it hard to move fast.

123
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,625
And if I'm going to beat Cell,
I can't have anything

124
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,250
slowing me down.

125
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,166
I may have great power,

126
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,041
but what good is it
if I can't catch my enemy?

127
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,250
It takes more than brute
strength to win a fight.

128
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,208
And transformations
waste a lot of energy.

129
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,875
You've been finding
that out yourself

130
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,333
when you've turned into a Super
Saiyan. It's not easy, right?

131
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:17,375
Right?!

132
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:18,916
Right.

133
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,041
[GOKU] We can't afford
to waste all that energy.

134
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,791
But at the same time, we need
the Super Saiyan power! You see?

135
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,166
Somehow, we have to
get to a point where it

136
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,166
feels natural to
be a Super Saiyan,

137
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,875
so that we can stay
like that all the time!

138
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,291
I want you try being a Super
Saiyan for the whole day.

139
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:40,541
We'll slow down our training
until it stops...

140
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,208
feeling so weird...

141
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:47,166
Yeah! Dad... I'll
do the best I can!

142
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,541
Amateur.

143
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:02,000
[CELL chuckles

144
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,208
You said you'd show
me true Saiyan power.

145
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:11,291
But all that you've done is
pump up your little muscles.

146
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,958
And there's nothing
special about that.

147
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,083
I could do that too,
if I wanted.

148
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,083
[CELL grunts]

149
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,541

00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,458
[CELL chuckles]

151
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,500
[CELL growls]

152
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,666
[CELL] You see?

153
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,583
It's rather easy to transform
and flaunt your powers.

154
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,291
But it's not going to get you
anywhere if your opponent

155
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,583
has any sort of speed!

156
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,333
You fool.

157
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:05,166
Honestly, it's a very simple
concept to understand.

158
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,500
Even Vegeta figured it out.

159
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:13,208
So, why can't you?

160
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,166
Oh, of course! That's why father
stopped getting stronger...

161
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,125
He... He could have, but
he knew about its limits!

162
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:33,708
[TRUNKS] And I just kept plowing
forward. Like a stupid child...

163
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:46,208
You can finish me
if you want. I've failed.

164
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,791
How very gracious of you.

165
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:59,166
Hey! How come Trunks' energy
suddenly decreased so fast?

166
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,666
It... doesn't make
sense... What happened?!

167
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,875
Cell... He's still
just as strong!

168
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:11,208
And now I can't
feel Trunks at all...

169
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,708
Oh no... maybe Cell beat him!

170
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,750
[VEGETA] Fine by me,
I'll take him!

171
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,166
[KRILLIN] Hey! Wait a minute!

172
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,333
I wait for no one!
Now Cell is mine!

173
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,083
But, you're hurt!

174
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,541
[VEGETA] Leave me alone.

175
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,833
[KRILLIN sighs]

176
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,416
What was I thinking?

177
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,208
I mean, it's just no use trying
to talk any sense into Vegeta.

178
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,666
Here we go again...

179
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:52,208
[BABY TRUNKS babbles]

180
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,458
[TIEN whimpers]

181
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,500
[PICCOLO growls]

182
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,708
What's up? Hasn't Trunks
put Cell's lights out yet?

183
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,375
It's over!

184
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,791
He did it? Trunks beat him?

185
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:09,083
No... he means Cell
has beaten Trunks.

186
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:09,791
[BULMA gasps]

187
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:12,750
This is bad... very bad!

188
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,083
What?! That means he's
in danger! Do something!

189
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,000
[CELL] What shall I do with you?

190
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,458
[CELL] Such an
interesting predicament.

191
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:29,791
Both you and Vegeta
have disappointed me.

192
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,791
I expected more of a challenge
from a pair of Super Saiyans.

193
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,791
However, there is something
that I am curious about.

194
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,375
I see you're very strong.
How did you become so powerful?

195
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,416
It's hard to believe
that you could develop

196
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,208
those fighting skills
in such a short time.

197
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,208
Tell me... how did you do it?

198
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,208
What is the secret
of your power?

199
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:59,583
[CELL] Don't want to talk?
Well, let me ask you this...

200
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,208
If you had more time,
could you get stronger?

201
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,791
[TRUNKS] Huh?!

202
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,083
Could you?

203
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,291
Maybe! What difference
does it make now?!

204
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,541
And why would you
even want to know?

205
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,875
[CELL chuckles]

206
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,166
Oh, just curious that's all.

207
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,375
One more question:
Where has Goku been?

208
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,083
And where has he been hiding?

209
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,291
For your information,
he's training to defeat you.

210
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:33,833
And make no mistake Cell, he
will be the one who beats you!

211
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,833
He'll take you, no contest!

212
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:42,333
No contest? Then, a tournament!

213
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,625
What do you mean?

214
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,375
[PICCOLO] What? No!
I don't believe it!

215
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:50,125
[BULMA] What happened?
Is Trunks alright?

216
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:54,583
Yeah, for now! Cell is planning
some kind of tournament!

217
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,541
[ALL gasp]

218
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,000
A tournament...?

219
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,958
[CELL chuckles]

220
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:06,166
[CELL] The tournament
will begin in 10 days...

221
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,833
And onsider yourself lucky that
I am giving you a second chance.

222
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:14,041
But, what are you talking about?

223
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,833
You really don't know, do you?

224
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,750
Long before we ever existed,
there was a competition

225
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,791
on this planet called the
"World Martial Arts Tournament."

226
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,333
I'm going to revive it

227
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,791
and prove once and for all
that I have no equal.

228
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,791
Each member of your
team may challenge me.

229
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,791
I will fight them one-on-one,
and when I win...

230
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:36,166
I'll face the next
challenger on your team.

231
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,458
Do you understand? Bring me
all the opponents you can.

232
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,791
The more fighters you bring...

233
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,333
the more chances
you'll have to survive!

234
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,916
[CELL] I have yet to decide a
location of the tournament,

235
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,083
so keep an eye on your
television for details.

236
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,416
[TRUNKS] The television?

237
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,666
It should be very entertaining.

238
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,208
[CELL chuckles]

239
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:03,208
Alright. Oh, and make
sure you bring plenty

240
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,750
of those Senzu beans.

241
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,791
Wait, tell me! What is the
real purpose of this tournament?

242
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,875
What are you
really going to do?!

243
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,375
Cell... I know what
you Androids are like!

244
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,625
I'm sure this is some
sort of a trick.

245
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,166
Just a trap to get us
all in one place, right?!

246
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,750
[CELL] Oh, must you
always treat everything

247
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,708
like it's the
end of the world?

248
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,875
There is no secret purpose.

249
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,083
I simply want to get as much
out of this planet as I can,

250
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,541
before I destroy it!

251
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:40,208
I have proven that
I am unstoppable.

252
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,916
Neither you or your friends
are any threat to me now.

253
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,833
However, there is one
that I want to test

254
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:48,708
my complete power against...

255
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,750
I want you to bring me Goku.

256
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,791
This tournament is sure
to be a guaranteed hit!

257
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:04,333
Everyone will be watching
me... I just can't wait

258
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,250
to see that look
of panic and fear!

259
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:07,875
[TRUNKS gasps]

260
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,291
That's it! That's the look!

261
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,791
[CELL laughs]

262
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,250
Until then...

263
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:20,791
[NARRATOR] Who
would have imagined

264
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,625
such a shocking turn of events?

265
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,291
By reviving the world
martial arts tournament,

266
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,291
Cell plans to
humiliate his opponents

267
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,083
in front of a live
television audience!

268
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,750
Talk about adding
insult to injury.

269
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:38,541
[NARRATOR] In only ten short
days, the tournament will begin.

270
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:41,791
The prize for the winner?
Control of the world!

271
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:45,250
Our heroes had better train hard
because it's time to put their

272
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,416
Super Saiyan
abilities to the test

273
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,291
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
