1
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,041
[GOKU]
I'd better get moving...

2
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,416
Goku was running
down Snake Way,

4
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,583
hoping to get some special
martial arts training

5
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:21,708
from the legendary
King Kai...

6
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,625
Meanwhile Gohan was busy

7
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,916
with his own survival
training back on Earth.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And the young
Saiyan soon learned

9
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,166
that it's not easy when you're
out in the world all alone.

10
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,875
Friends are hard
to hold on to,

11
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,833
especially when
they're the main course

12
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,541
on the menu for
a hungry T-Rex!

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:42,000
Careful Gohan, or you could
end up being his dessert!

14
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,500
Luckily, Gohan's a
natural born fighter,

15
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,125
just like his
father Goku.

16
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,000
But he hasn't developed
the fighting skills

17
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,375
of his father yet.

18
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,541
And with his dino buddy
digested by the big T-Rex,

19
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,833
Gohan soon found out,
only the strong survive!

20
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,333
Speaking of strong...

21
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,708
Two sinister Saiyans are headed
towards Earth right now.

22
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,500
Every minute
they get closer

23
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,166
and that means
it won't be long

24
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,958
before we all find out what
the big bang theory really is...

25
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:14,875
Keep your eyes on the skies and
get ready for Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:29,041
[birds chirp]

27
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,000
[squawking]

28
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:36,125
[snoring]

29
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,875
[DINOSAURS squawk]

30
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:47,000
Hm? Breakfast time!

31
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:54,875
[GOHAN giggles]

32
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:05,000
[giggling continues]

33
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:16,416
Haaaaaa!

34
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,958
Ahh...

35
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,333
[chuckles]

36
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,000
Ahh...

37
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,375
[loud thuds]

38
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,208
Huh?

39
00:04:53,291 --> 00:05:01,916
[growling]

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,875
What's up? Nice day,
huh? You look hungry!

41
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,750
[roars]

42
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,583
[GOHAN]
Whoa!

43
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,500
[roars]

44
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:30,500
[roaring continues]

45
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:34,416
Catch me if you can!
Nyah! Nyah!

46
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:52,416
Great! It looks like
tail steak for breakfast!

47
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,333
Hey... You won't have much of
a tail if you keep this up.

48
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:03,500
I used to have a
tail too, you know!

49
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,791
[T-REX groans]

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,375
So, he's starting to
master the training.

51
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:26,000
[chuckles]

52
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:30,041
[NARRATOR] Somewhere, deep
in the vastness of space,

53
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,916
the two Saiyan warriors
continue their journey

54
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,291
towards planet Earth.

55
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,875
[COMPUTER]
Prince Vegeta!

56
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:43,750
We are now within one
parsec of the planet Arlia.

57
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,500
Initiating
vapor bath.

58
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,500
It is time to
wake up now!

59
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,875
[beeping]

60
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,833
[YAMCHA] Oh boy!

61
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,583
I can't believe Kami
is going to train me!

62
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:08,208
I'm so excited I can hardly
wait to get started!

63
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,833
Just take it easy, Yamcha.

64
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,333
You know we
have to find out

65
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,333
where Tien and
Chiaotzu are first!

66
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,791
[KRILLIN laughs]

67
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,833
I bet they'll be surprised
to see us! Heh, heh!

68
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,583
And once we
find those two,

69
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,333
Yamcha can start his
training with Kami

70
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,083
and then no one will be
able to beat him in battle!

71
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,583
That's right...

72
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,791
I'll be ready for anything!

73
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,000
[KRILLIN and PUAR laugh]

74
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,625
[PUAR] You said it!
That'll be great!

75
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,750
[YAMCHA] Hey, step on it,
would ya, Bulma?!

76
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,416
[VEGETA] Nappa? Nappa?
Are you awake?

77
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,541
[NAPPA groans]

78
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,000
I am now.
What's going on?

79
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,791
Nothing much.

80
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:52,041
But, I thought we'd make a stop
and stretch our legs a bit.

81
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,000
Get some exercise.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
[VEGETA] Planet Arlia's
not far from here.

83
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:59,750
Maybe we can sell it
for a nice price.

84
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,791
That sounds good.

85
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,166
[chuckles]

86
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,250
I hope these Arlians
know how to fight,

87
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,708
we haven't had any
real competition

88
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,958
in a very long time.

89
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,458
Wow, whatta mess!

90
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,708
[VEGETA] Huh?

91
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708
[NAPPA] There's not much
to this place is there?

92
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,333
[VEGETA] Obviously not.

93
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,458
Let's have a look
around shall we?

94
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,666
Are you sure you can get a
high price for this planet?

95
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,375
Doubt it...

96
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,916
[VEGETA] Let's check
around a little more.

97
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,833
[beeping]

98
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:16,041
[ARLIAN 1] You are trespassing
on Arlian territory!

99
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,375
[ARLIAN 2] Make one move
and we'll blast ya!

100
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,333
It was a good day to
go hunting after all!

101
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,791
[ARLIAN 1] Let's give
them a proper welcoming.

102
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,750
[ARLIAN 1 chuckles]

103
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,875
[NAPPA]
Let's blast 'em!

104
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,583
Easy!

105
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:33,458
[ARLIAN 1] Surrender peacefully
or face the consequences!

106
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,833
No!

107
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,375
[ARLIAN 1]
Have it your way then.

108
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,916
You've left us no choice!
Prepare to be destroyed!

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,791
Hyaah!

110
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,125
[ARLIAN 1]
That's the end of them!

111
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,541
[gasps]

112
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,500
[ARLIAN 2]
Surrender at once!

113
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,541
Yeah, make me! Grrrh!

114
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,791
[VEGETA telepathically]
Nappa!

115
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:03,333
Surrender to them! Let's have
a little fun while we're here!

116
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,458
[NAPPA]
Oh, alright...

117
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,916
[ARLIAN 1] Move in!
They're giving up!

118
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,666
[ARLIAN 2] Ha! I guess
we were too much for them!

119
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,125
[ARLIAN 1]
Eh, they sure are ugly!

120
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,916
[ARLIAN 2] But they'll be good
entertainment for the King.

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,083
[NAPPA chuckles]

122
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:21,125
[sirens blare]

123
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,666
[POLICEMAN A]
Stop thief! Stop!

124
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,375
[POLICEMAN B]
You're under arrest!

125
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,583
[LAUNCH]
Ugh! Get off my back!

126
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,916
Sorry for all
the trouble,

127
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,708
but this oughta give you
some bang for your bucks!

128
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:37,500
[POLICEMEN yell]

129
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,708
[screaming]

130
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,458
Well, this is
for you, Tien!

131
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,500
And you better
wait for me,

132
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,916
'cause I'm gonna get
you lots of food

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,833
with these
greenbacks!

134
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,750
[ATTENDANT]
More fruit, your highness?

135
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,708
[KING]
Most entertaining!

136
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:59,000
Come Lemlia,
won't you join me?

137
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,958
[PRISONERS groan]

138
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,291
[ARLIAN GUARD]
Get in there, ugly!

139
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,291
You'll be
glad to know,

140
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,541
your cell doesn't
have any rats!

141
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,583
The prisoners ate 'em all!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

142
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,916
Hey remind me to
get that guy, okay?

143
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,083
[VEGETA chuckles]

144
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,875
[PRISONER 1]
Look at those aliens!

145
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,958
[PRISONER 2] Goodness, they're
an ugly pair, aren't they?

146
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,833
[PRISONER 3] Maybe they think
that we're the ugly ones!

147
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,333
Did you ever
think of that?

148
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,125
[PRISONER 2]
Hmph! Speak for yourself!

149
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,000
[ATLA] Be quiet,
all of you!

150
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,458
It doesn't matter
what they look like!

151
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,916
They're stuck in here
just like the rest of us!

152
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,291
Can't you see that?

153
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,333
They're just more victims
of that tyrant king!

154
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,208
Locked away
and left to rot!

155
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,750
I'm afraid you visitors
have come at a bad time.

156
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,166
The new king of Arlia
is very ruthless.

157
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,708
He uses us prisoners
for his own amusement.

158
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:56,000
He even went so far as to
steal my wife, Lemlia,

159
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,500
on the day that
we were to be married...

160
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:00,041
So you can imagine
the pain I feel.

161
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:03,208
[KING] Lemlia please,
you have to eat something.

162
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,791
[LEMLIA] No thank you.
I'm not hungry.

163
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,375
[KING]
Don't be so stubborn...

164
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,041
You have to put the
past behind you...

165
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,958
You are my Queen now.

166
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,791
[LEMLIA] No! There is only
one that I truly love.

167
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:17,916
[FIGHTER 2 yells and groans]

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,750
[KING]
Enough!

169
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:24,125
Take Gregor to the pit!
Esaw is the new champion!

170
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,833
[GREGOR]
No, not the pit!

171
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,458
Please, Sire, not the pit! No!

172
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,000
This isn't fair!

173
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,833
[GREGOR screams]

174
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,833
No! Please.
Don't leave me down here!

175
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,041
Give me another chance!

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,666
[GREGOR screams]

177
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,583
No, Yeddy!
Please, stay away from me!

178
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,416
Stay away! A-Ahhh!

179
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:12,583
[GREGOR screams]

180
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:13,750
[KING sighs]

181
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,458
[KING] I'm suffering
from royal boredom!

182
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,250
[ATTENDANT] Sire, earlier
today we captured two aliens.

183
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,541
They're in
the dungeon now!

184
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,958
[KING]
Aliens?

185
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,583
Have the guards bring them
to the arena immediately.

186
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,125
Maybe they can provide some
entertainment fit for a king!

187
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,541
[VEGETA] Don't put yourselves
out! We're already here!

188
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
[KING] What's the
meaning of this?

189
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,666
Why don't these prisoners have
an armed escort in my chamber?

190
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,875
[ATTENDANT]
I don't know, Sire!

191
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,416
No orders were even
sent to the dungeon.

192
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,083
[VEGETA] Your guards met with
an unfortunate accident.

193
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:40,916
[ATLA] Now's my chance to
get out of this place.

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,958
[PRISONERS groan]

195
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,416
[ATLA] I must to get to
the King's chamber at once!

196
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,666
Amazing!

197
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,541
Those two aliens melted
through the cell bars.

198
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,666
That makes things a
lot easier for me!

199
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,166
[KING] How dare you!

200
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,458
Soon it will be your turn

201
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:06,666
to meet with an
unfortunate accident.

202
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,708
You may not want to
watch this, my dear.

203
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:09,958
[LEMLIA]
Very well.

204
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,875
[KING] I'll see that my
guards make short work

205
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:14,583
of these
repulsive creatures!

206
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:15,833
Really?

207
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,958
[KING]
Ah, let's see!

208
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,750
Yes, we'll test the big
one with the shiny head

209
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,625
against our
champion in combat!

210
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,291
We'll save the
little one for last,

211
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,041
he won't put up much of
a fight I'm sure!

212
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Now teach
them a lesson!

213
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,583
[ESAW] Yes, Sire!

214
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,000
[KING]
And Esaw?

215
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,583
I'll see that you
retire a wealthy man

216
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,375
if you can defeat
both of them.

217
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,125
Now begin!

218
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,625
[ESAW] Haa!

219
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:41,208
[ESAW yowls]

220
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,125
[KING] Huh?!

221
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,208
[ESAW screams]

222
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,000
[NAPPA] Heh! I guess that makes
you the new champion, Vegeta!

223
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:49,916
[VEGETA chuckles]

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,333
[KING]
Not bad!

225
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,541
But ten of our finest warriors
have mastered techniques

226
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,458
using energy
just like yours!

227
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,250
They have? Interesting!
We'd like to fight them!

228
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,541
Ready?

229
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:04,250
[KING] I'll see you suffer
for your insolence!

230
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,625
[NAPPA] Yeah, whatever.
Can we get on with this already?

231
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,041
[KING]
Ah! How dare you!

232
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,500
C'mon, your
heinousness!

233
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,541
Bring on that cricket brigade
of yours! We're ready!

234
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,208
[KING] Take a good look
at my Elite Royal Guards.

235
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,541
Now, you won't be talking
so tough, will you?

236
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,166
[ROYAL GUARD 1]
Fire!

237
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,500
[chuckles]

238
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,958
[gasps]

239
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,541
Was that it? It felt good.
Real refreshing!

240
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,250
[KING]
Oh, I'll make you pay!

241
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,375
If you think you can
just walk out of here,

242
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,416
you are sadly
mistaken!

243
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,291
Guards attack!
Destroy them!

244
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,666
[ROYAL GUARD 3]
We got 'em now!

245
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,791
[ROYAL GUARD 6]
Attack!

246
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,333
[NAPPA laughs]

247
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,375
[ROYAL GUARDS yell]

248
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,208
[GOKU thinking]
Where's King Kai's place?

249
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,916
It's got to be around
here somewhere!

250
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:19,833
[NAPPA yells]

251
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,125
[ROYAL GUARDS whimper]

252
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:34,791
[NAPPA yells]

253
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,750
[KING] Release Yeddy!
Release Yeddy!

254
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,250
Hurry before it's too late!

255
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:52,750
[rumbling]

256
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:13,083
[YEDDY growls gutturally]

257
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,208
So, it's the old giant
bug in the ground trick!

258
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,875
[KING] Yeddy,
destroy these creatures!

259
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,500
They're bad!
Very, very bad!

260
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,625
We're bad?

261
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, a little.

262
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,208
[VEGETA] Over here!

263
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,083
[NAPPA] Hey, ugly!

264
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,291
[NAPPA grunts]

265
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:58,875
[KING] That fool! He's no
match for Yeddy's strength!

266
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:03,916
[NAPPA grunts]

267
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:13,541
[YEDDY roars]

268
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,125
[KING] No!

269
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,833
Hey! I've got one more
little surprise for you!

270
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,291
[NAPPA grunts]

271
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,416
Yaah! It's your
going away present!

272
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,041
[KING]
No! Impossible!

273
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,791
Coward!

274
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,625
[KING] Please!
Don't hurt me!

275
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:42,041
Aaahh!

276
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,416
[ATLA] It sounds like there's
a battle going on up there!

277
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,833
I'm coming for
you, Lemlia.

278
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:52,500
What? Unbelievable!

279
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:56,583
The king and his Royal
Guard have been destroyed!

280
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:57,541
[VEGETA]
Computer.

281
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,208
[COMPUTER]
Yes, Prince Vegeta?

282
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,208
[VEGETA]
Send the pods at once.

283
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:04,083
[COMPUTER]
Initiating retrieval sequence.

284
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,333
[ATLA] Do you two realize
what you have done?

285
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,250
You have freed our planet
from centuries of bondage!

286
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,958
At last Arlia is a place where
a new beginning can be made!

287
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,875
From now on you two
visitors from space

288
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,291
will be known as heroes
among our people.

289
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:20,916
I can't begin to tell you
how very grateful I am.

290
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,250
[ATLA]
Farewell, my friends!

291
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,000
You will always be
welcome here on Arlia!

292
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,583
[ATLA] Thank you!

293
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
We will never forget you!

294
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,791
[LEMLIA] Atla?

295
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,041
[ATLA] Huh?

296
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,333
[LEMLIA] Atla! Thank goodness!
You're alive!

297
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,416
[ATLA] Do my eyes deceive me?
Is it really you, Lemlia?

298
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,708
[LEMLIA] Yes, it's me,
Altla, your Lemlia!

299
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:47,666
[ATLA] You don't know how happy
I am to see you, my love!

300
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,041
[VEGETA] 
Let's go, Nappa!

301
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,083
We couldn't give away
this place if we wanted to.

302
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,375
[NAPPA] But that thing back
there said we were heroes!

303
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,750
Being a hero is
highly overrated.

304
00:20:56,833 --> 00:21:02,875
Ergh. Too bad, I guess, that
was a big waste of time then.

305
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,625
[VEGETA] Don't worry there's
still Earth to conquer!

306
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,500
[LEMLIA] Atla!

307
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,750
[VEGETA] Hold on. I've got
some unfinished business

308
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
to take care of...

309
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:26,250
This planet has a
serious bug problem.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,875
[ATLA] 
Lemlia, my darling!

311
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,041
[LEMLIA]
Atla!

312
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,083
[giggles]

313
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,166
[LEMLIA]
Atla, my love!

314
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,625
[ATLA] My darling! At last
we can be together forever!

315
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,916
[LEMLIA and ATLA giggle]

316
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,208
There's nothing like
a little fireworks

317
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:57,625
when you say goodbye!

318
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:01,000
[NAPPA] Heh! Their moon, too!
Nice touch!

319
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:05,916
[VEGETA] I think we've
made the universe

320
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,333
a cleaner
place today.

321
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,041
Arlia deserved
what they got.

322
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:12,333
I just hope Earth is a lot
better than that planet.

323
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,208
It will be...
Earth has the Dragon Balls.

324
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,416
Once we find them, we can
wish for whatever we want!

325
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,541
Hm. Immortality,
here we come!

326
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:32,041
[evil laughing]

327
00:22:32,125 --> 00:22:34,375
[NARRATOR] The dangerous
duo is on a mission

328
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,458
and they've got Earth
in their sights.

329
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,666
What the world needs
now is a hero,

330
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,791
someone to
save the day.

331
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,083
Someone like Goku, but he's
still busy on Snake Way.

332
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,166
[GOKU] Doesn't this
road ever end?!

333
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,500
[NARRATOR]
We'll find out...

334
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,666
on the next
exciting episode

335
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,416
of Dragon Ball Z!
