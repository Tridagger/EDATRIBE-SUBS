00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,333
two young juniors vied for
the title of World Champion!

3
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,083
One of them was Trunks,
son of Vegeta.

4
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,791
The other was Goten,
son of Goku.

5
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,583
The winner could
rightly be called

6
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,083
the strongest boy in the world.

7
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,583
The action paused
for only a moment,

8
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,833
when the confident
Trunks took a time out

9
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,083
to make an
interesting proposition.

10
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,083
[GOTEN] Huh?

11
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,125
Yep! That's right!
Now look, you...

12
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,666
You're cooked!

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,166
I'm going to win this thing
without using one of my arms!

14
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,250
Come on, Trunks!
You wouldn't have a chance!

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,750
Ahh! You! You can't
beat me with one arm!

16
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,250
[TRUNKS] No left arm!

17
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,958
[TRUNKS growls]

18
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,416
[grunting]

19
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,000
[GOTEN] No fair!

20
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,625
[NARRATOR] The two young
warriors faught passionately

21
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,333
to the end, when Goten
made a head-on attack

22
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,333
that would determine the match.

23
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,250
[GOTEN] Here I come!

24
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,333
[GOTEN yells]

25
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,791
[TRUNKS] What?!

26
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,375
[GOTEN screams]

27
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,875
[NARRATOR] A victor has emerged!

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,333
Young Trunks is the new
Junior World Champion!

29
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,958
And now it's time for him to
fight an exhibition match

30
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,750
with the reigning World
Champion himself, Mr. Satan.

31
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,500
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen,

32
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,125
we are proud to bring
to you an exhibition match

33
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,416
between Trunks, the new
Junior World Champion,

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,291
and Mr Satan, the greatest
Martial Arts expert alive!

35
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:06,083
[CROWD cheers]

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,166
Mr. Satan!

37
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,708
[ANNOUNCER] That's right, fans!
Give it up for Mr. Satan!

38
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,375
Let's get him out here!
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

39
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:19,333
Yeah! What a strong junior
and over three feet tall!

40
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,375
It's going to take
everything you have

41
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:23,000
to win this one, Mr. Satan!

42
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,583
[ATTENDANT laughs]

43
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:26,958
Well, the truth is,
I don't have a chance

44
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,833
of beating him!

45
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,500
[ATTENDANT laughs]

46
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,416
Yeah, right!

47
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,083
[MR. SATAN laughs]

48
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,750
No, hey, uh,
I'm totally serious...

49
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,458
[BOTH laugh

50
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,708
[ATTENDANT] That's a good one,
sir! You crack me up! Aw, boy!

51
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,958
Whew!

52
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,250
Hey, kid, do you want to
rest before we begin?

53
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,875
[TRUNKS] Nah, I'm fine.

54
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,208
Alright, then.

55
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:53,583
Ladies and gentlemen!
Introducing... Mr. Satan!

56
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,916
Don't be too hard on him, sir!

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,166
--[MR. SATAN squeals]
--[ATTENDANT laughs]

58
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,541
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

59
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,333
Yeah! Mr. Satan rules!

60
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,416
You're the king!

61
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,958
[MAN 3] Show him
how it's done, Champ!

62
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,291
Yeaah!

63
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,875
Alright, you people!
I hope you're ready to rock,

64
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,958
because Mr. Satan's
gonna raise the roof!

65
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:18,041
[CROWD] Mis-ter Sa-tan!
Mis-ter Sa-tan! Mis-ter Sa-tan!

66
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:21,833
[MR. SATAN laughs]

67
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:23,416
Alright, little man!

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,291
Are you ready to go
toe-to-toe with the Champ?!

69
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,541
Yeaaah! Ha, ha, alright!

70
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,291
Well, you better watch it, son!

71
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm the greatest
fighter of all time!

72
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,375
And I forgot to
bring my kid gloves!

73
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,291
Yeah! Ahhhhh!

74
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,583
[thinking] Now what
am I going to do?!

75
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:44,291
This kid has
no fear of anything!

76
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,750
[thinking] I wonder if this guy
is as strong as he says he is?

77
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:52,000
He looks like a big gorilla!
Looks can be deceiving, though.

78
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,083
Hmm...

79
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,333
Tear him apart, Trunks!
You can do it!

80
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,541
[MR. SATAN squeals]

81
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,583
Quiet there, kid!
Watch your mouth!

82
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,916
Let's not encourage
him too much, okay?!

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,375
[GOTEN] Huh?

84
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,041
Man! He's just too
pitiful to watch!

85
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:08,958
Does, uh, anyone else
wanna get something to eat?

86
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,458
Sure, that sounds
good to me.

87
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:12,833
--Let's do it!
--[VIDEL] Huh?

88
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:14,375
Hey, wait you guys!

89
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,458
Don't you want to see the fight
between Trunks and my dad?!

90
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:19,166
He is the reigning
World Champion, you know?

91
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,833
Don't you want to
study his technique?!

92
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,208
Ha, ha! Yeah! Of course we do!

93
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,375
Whatd'ya say, guys?! Sounds like
a great opportunity, huh?!

94
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,583
[GOKU] Thanks, but I
think we'll pass! See ya!

95
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,208
[MR. SATAN] Ohh yeah...

96
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,583
[MR. SATAN]
That's right, c'mon...

97
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:47,083
[MR. SATAN growls]

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,208
[MR. SATAN yells]

[grunting]

[MR. SATAN growls]

101
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,291
[yelling]

102
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,750
[thinking] What in the
world is he doing?!

103
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,500
He couldn't have
been serious just then!

104
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:20,750
He must be trying to trick me
into thinking that he's weak!

105
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,083
Well, I'm not buying it!

106
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,458
[MR. SATAN squeals]

107
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,875
Hey, kid! Let's
take it easy, okay?!

108
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,958
This is just an
exhibition match!

109
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,083
Right?! We're not
supposed to be too serious!

110
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,458
Exhibition means
a pretend fight!

111
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,416
See?! Huh?

112
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,666
No way! I'm going
to try my best!

113
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,833
[MR. SATAN gasps]

114
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,750
You little runt!
Don't you get it?!

115
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,500
It's not supposed
to be a real match!

116
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,041
I'm going for the win, jerk!

117
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,250
No, no!! Don't you understand
what I'm trying to say?!

118
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,250
Exhibition matches
are make-believe!

119
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,583
[TRUNKS] Whatever.

120
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,583
--[MR. SATAN growls]
--It looks like they're both

ready to get this
match underway!

122
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,666
Let's hear it for these
two great warriors!

123
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,750
If that were my son,

124
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,750
I wouldn't even let him
in the ring with Mr. Satan!

125
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,791
No way! Sheesh!

126
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,125
I'm with you, friend!

127
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,666
His parents must be insane
to let him in there!

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,666
Kick his butt, Trunks! Yeah!

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,291
[thinking]
This is like a bad dream!

130
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,375
Huh...?

131
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:35,125
[MR. SATAN] Yowwrrgghh!

132
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,458
[ANNOUNCER yells]

133
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,791
Oh no! It looks like
Mr. Satan is down!

134
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,166
And he's in some
really serious pain!

135
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,375
Oooh!

136
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,541
Don't worry about me, I'm fine!

137
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,500
Just an old knee injury
from fighting Cell!

138
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,583
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

139
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,375
Whoa! Did you hear that, folks?
A knee injury from Cell!

140
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:58,166
Really! I'll be just fine!
It pops out of place sometimes!

141
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,333
I... I can fix it!
Just give me a few minutes!

142
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,208
Oh no, you're going to
have to have it looked at!

143
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,208
Bring out the doctor! Emergency!

144
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,083
Got it! It popped
right back into place!

145
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,583
It's painful but it
works like a charm!

146
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,500
Now then, let's get this

147
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,500
ridiculous exhibition
match over with!

148
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,416
Shall we continue then?!

149
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,166
Okay...

150
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,041
[ANNOUNCER] Amazing! It's fixed!
Mr. Satan has popped his knee

151

back into place and
he's ready to fight!

152
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,333
[thinking]
Wh-What am I going to do?!

153
00:09:31,416 --> 00:09:33,666
Heroes don't get beat up
by small children!

154
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,000
My reputation!
Everything I've worked for!

155
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,458
Gone! All gone!
People are going to laugh at me!

156
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,708
Nooooo!

157
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm not going to let it happen!
He's just a kid!

158
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,500
I'll outsmart the little rascal!

159
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,041
Let the match begin!

160
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,041
Whoa-whoa-Whoa!
Wait just a second!

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,458
Good luck, kid!
May the best man win!

162
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:56,083
Hey, let's make real sure not
to hit each other really hard

163
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
when we're doing
the Champions' gGreeting

164
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,833
at the beginning of the match!

165
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,500
Champions' Greeting?

166
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,583
That's right!

167
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,375
World Champions
have a special way of

168
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,291
greeting each other
before a match!

169
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,958
It's like a punch, only super
soft, right in the face!

170
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:12,750
Get it?! Little tiny touch!
Right there on the cheek!

171
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,583
Except with fists! Okay...?

172
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:16,916
Now remember, kid!

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,041
When you think "Champions'
Greeting", think soft!

174
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,208
Am I clear?! Do you understand?

175
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,375
I think so! It sounds
simple enough!

176
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,833
Yeah!

177
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,041
[MR. SATAN] Alright!
We're ready whenever you are!

178
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,708
[MR. SATAN laughs]

179
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,375
[MR. SATAN]
Just discussing strategy!

180
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,166
This one's a real firecracker!

181
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,000
Reminds me of myself
when I was his age!

182
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,458
Wow... Tender moments...

183
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,875
Alrighty then! Here
we go, sports fans!

184
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,791
Our champ has given
the thumbs up!

185
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,541
Without further delay,
let the match begin!

186
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,041
Yeah! Oh yeah! Let's do it!

187
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,250
Egads! Look at that!
In the confident style

188
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,666
of a true champion, Trunks is
being offered a free shot!

189
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,958
Now that's a fighter,
ladies and gentlemen!

190
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,416
What a class act!

191
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,625
--How great!
--Hang in there, kid!

192
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,041
[MR. SATAN] It's time
for the greeting, kid!

193
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,250
[MR. SATAN groans]

194
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,958
[MR. SATAN yells]

195
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
[ANNOUNCER whimpers]

196
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,083
But...

197
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,166
One punch, it's, uh...

198
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:05,875
Father!

199
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,500
Ahh, darn it, Trunks!

200
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,750
Why'd you have to go and
do something like that?!

201
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,333
[TRUNKS] Hmph.

202
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,458
[ANNOUNCER] Wow! Oooh!

203
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,000
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

204
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:34,375
[GOTEN] Huh?

205
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,750
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, my goodness!
Mr. Satan's out cold!

206
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,208
Oh, Dad!

207
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,166
[MR. SATAN grunts]

208
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:49,833
[ANNOUNCER] Wait! Wait a minute!
He's getting up!

209
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,166
[MR. SATAN laughs]

210
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,625
What a punch! Man!

211
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,333
[MR. SATAN laughs]

212
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,458
Yeah! He beat me up
fair and square! Yep!

213
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,041
What a great little fighter!

214
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:11,208
Well! That's it! Young Trunks
has defeated Mr. Satan!

215
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,458
Wow! What a guy!
He let the kid win, didn't he?!

216
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,458
Heck yeah! That kid
didn't have a chance!

217
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,041
Now that's what I call
a hero, alright!

218
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:22,416
[MR. SATAN] Thank you!
Thank you! I love you all!

219
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,875
[TRUNKS] Hm?!

220
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,541
[ATTENDANT laughs]

221
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,666
Satan... You're always
so full of surprises!

222
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,208
Come on.

223
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,333
You didn't really think that
I would fight a kid, did you?

224
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,666
[thinking] I can't
figure that guy out!

225
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,416
Is he super strong
and just lost on purpose?

226
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,041
Or is he just a
stupid weakling?!

227
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,291
[FAN 2] Alright,
Hercule! You rule!

228
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,541
[MR. SATAN sighs]

229
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,000
[MR. SATAN yells]

230
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,416
The pain! The pain!
Oh, I can't stand it!

231
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,916
Oh, I just wanna die!
I hate that kid!

232
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,916
Ahhh! The pain!

233
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,791
Well, congratulations, Trunks!

234
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,375
You're stronger than the
World Champion, kid!

235
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:13,333
[CROWD cheers]

236
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,166
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and gentlemen...

237
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,375
The main event, the World
Martial Arts Championship,

238
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,750
will begin in just
thirty minutes!

239
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,250
And don't forget to visit one
of our concession stands

240
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,500
during the intermission!

241
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,875
We've got cold drinks,
chili dogs,

242
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,500
and mouth-watering nachos!

243
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,750
I've had those nachos. Yuck!

244
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,708
Yeah, no joke! You've got
one day, you gotta eat well!

245
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,833
Hey, there's the waiting
area for the athletes!

246
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:39,708
They always have
good food in these places!

247
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,333
Whoa! Hold on!

248
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:44,166
The general public's
not allowed in here!

249
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,416
This is for qualifiers only!

250
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,875
Heeey, relax man!
We are qualifiers!

251
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,708
We all passed
the qualifying test,

252
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,083
and with flying colors
I might add...

253
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,250
Ohh? We'll see about that!

254
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,166
Names please! You first!

255
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,458
I'm Goku.

256
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,000
The name is Krillin.

257
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,500
Number 18.

258
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,625
Vegeta.

259
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,666
Majunior!

260
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,958
Huh...? "Majunior"?

261
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,166
Yeah, I thought
I'd go undercover.

262
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,083
Protect my identity
a little bit.

263
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:15,958
Oh, yeah. Sure, I get it.

264
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,708
Alright! Looks good!

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,375
Your names are
on the list!

266
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,583
Welcome to the
athlete's resort area!

267
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,333
You can take a sauna or a
whirlpool bath,

268
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:28,541
have a massage, play ping-pong
or enjoy our buffet style lunch!

269
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,583
Make yourselves at home!

270
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,583
[KRILLIN] Gee, thanks!

271
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,166
[GOKU] Yeah! That's really nice.

272
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,708
[VEGETA] Well,
I'd say it's about time

273
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:36,083
we got some special treatment!

274
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,125
[KRILLIN] Well, they
do make their money

275
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,625
'cause people
wanna see us fight!

276
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:40,125
Speaking of money,

277
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,750
think you can save some of
that prize money for me, Goku?

278
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, you don't have to worry.

279
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,458
I don't need money
where I'm going.

280
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,125
Can't take it with you, huh?

281
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,291
Well, as your good friend,

282
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,291
I'd be happy to look
after your winnings.

283
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,000
No thanks. Why don't you
come to Other World with me?

284
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:58,416
What, no way! I'm married now,
bro! This is the good life!

285
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,708
Right, babe?

286
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:01,208
Goon.

287
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,208
[LADY REPORTER] Has anyone ever
told you how cute you are?

288
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,583
[TRUNKS] No.

289
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,291
So Brief is your last name!
Trunks Brief! I like it!

290
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,375
He's gonna be a
real heart-throb!

291
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,708
That's for sure!

292
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,583
Do you have any words for
your fellow countrymen

293
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:16,208
as the new Junior World
Martial Arts Champion?

294
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,916
Uhh, anything?

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,375
[TRUNKS] No.

296
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,375
What is your favorite
T.V. show, Trunks?!

297
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,958
Hey, Trunks! What was it like
fighting against the Champ?!

298
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,125
Ahh! Ask him!
He's coming out!

299
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,708
--[REPORTERS] Huh?!
--[TRUNKS] Goten!

300
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,916
[GOTEN] Huh? Oh, ha, ha!

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,208
Huh?! Look! There he goes!

302
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,208
[REPORTERS] Huh?!

303
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,541
[REPORTERS] Trunks, come back!

304
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:38,916
We haven't gotten
our interview yet!

305
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,125
[TRUNKS &amp; GOTEN grunt]

306
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,750
Reporters... They're
just rude people.

307
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,750
Yeah, whew.

308
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,250
Hey, don't forget your promise!

309
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,791
You've gotta give me
three of your toys, right?!

310
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,541
Ahh... Yes, I do.

311
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,166
But we have more important
things to talk about!

312
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,375
Huh?!

313
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,833
Yeah, think!

314
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,541
Wouldn't it be cool to fight
in the big championships?

315
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,250
Well, yeah! But are
we allowed to do that?!

316
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:13,458
[TRUNKS] Well, hmm...

317
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,416
[GOKU slurps]

318
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,416
[WAITER 1] There you are, sir.

319
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,250
[GOKU slurps]

320
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,791
Whew! This is good stuff!

321
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,458
Ugh... You know, I...

322
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,166
don't think I'll ever
get used to this...

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,458
Man, Goku. You sure
eat a lot for a dead guy.

324
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:51,958
You know, that's exactly what
King Kai always tells me!

325
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,291
But what can I say?
I just love to eat!

326
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,291
[KRILLIN] You're tellin' me...

327
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,291
Cool! It's chow time!

328
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:02,125
[GOKU] Gohan! Hey! Alright!
How did it go, guys?

329
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,500
[GOHAN] It was
pretty interesting!

330
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,166
Trunks beat Mr. Satan
with one punch!

331
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,625
[GOKU] Really?!

332
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,333
But everyone thinks that he
lost the match on purpose

333
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,541
just to be a gentleman!

334
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,083
[KRILLIN] Hmph!
What a guy, huh?!

335
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,291
He should get an
Academy Award for that one!

336
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:16,958
And just what do
you mean by that?!

337
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,541
You don't know Krillin!
He's always joking like that!

338
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,708
[GOHAN laughs]

339
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:25,166
Isn't that right?! You never
know when to stop, do you?!

340
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,333
[KRILLIN] That's right!
Now let go, please!

341
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,791
[VIDEL] Hmm...

342
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:32,250
Hey, guys! We ordered
for you already!

343
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,375
Pull up a chair!
It's really good!

344
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,625
Alright! Great! I'm famished!

345
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:55,583
Hey, Dad! We're out of pasta!

346
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,500
'Scuse me! More
spaghetti please!

347
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,791
[VEGETA] And bring some more
eggrolls while you're at it!

348
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,791
Good grief! You Saiyans are
like bottomless pits, I swear!

349
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:06,958
What's a Saiyan?

350
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,250
Krillin! Hello?!

351
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,000
[KRILLIN] Oops!
I'm sorry, Gohan!

352
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,333
I'm just not going
to talk anymore!

353
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,625
Yup, lips are sealed!

354
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,333
[GOKU] Mmmm, ahhhh!
That was incredible!

355
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,791
What a feast!

356
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,958
[GOKU] Woweee! I'm so full!

357
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,416
If I have to fight
one of you guys,

358
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,208
please don't punch
me in the gut!

359
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,333
You didn't eat anything!
You must be on a diet!

360
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:30,916
[KRILLIN] Believe
it or not, Gohan!

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,666
Most athletes don't like
to stuff themselves

362
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,416
before a big match!

363
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,083
[ANDROID 18] Hey, we should
go check the draw.

364
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:37,625
See who's fighting who.

365
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,958
[VEGETA] Well, if I have to
fight Kakarot the first round,

366
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,000
the first thing I'm going
to do is punch him in the gut!

367
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,541
--[PICCOLO] Hm?
--[GOKU] Aw, man! No mercy!

368
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,625
Huh...?

369
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,166
Hey, Gohan!

370
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,041
I'm picking up some
weird vibes from these guys!

371
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,583
Good afternoon.

372
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,500
You wouldn't be Goku by
any chance, would you?

373
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,833
Yeah. How did you know
that my name is Goku?

374
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,916
Well, your reputation as a
great fighter precedes you.

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,375
I was actually hoping for a
chance to fight you

376
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,833
during the tournament.

377
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,416
It's not that I'm confident
about beating you. Not at all.

378
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,333
It's just that I want to have
the greatest challenge

379
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:50,291
that I can think of,
and I know you're a man

380
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,791
who understands that.

381
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,958
Well then, It was
a real pleasure.

382
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,458
I'm honored...

383
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:00,833
And I'm very much looking
forward to today's competition.

384
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,291
I've traveled very far
for this opportunity

385
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,708
to meet you in battle.

386
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,500
You might even say that
I'm one of your biggest fans.

387
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,250
In any case, after meeting you,

388
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,333
I'm certain that I
won't be disappointed.

389
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,125
[GOKU] Gosh, thanks!

390
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,458
Goku, may I shake your hand?

391
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,458
Huh? Yeah, of course!

392
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,291
[chuckling]

393
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,083
Huh...?

394
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:40,250
Alright! Thank you. You're as
brave as everyone says you are.

395
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,708
[GOKU] Uhh...

396
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,583
Good day.

397
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,666
[GOKU] Hey, wait a second!
I didn't catch your name!

398
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,083
I don't like the feel
of it. They're strong.

399
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,875
Real strong...

400
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,333
But, hey, isn't that what
this tournament's about?

401
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,041
Finding the unexpected challenge

402
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,958
and seeing who
emerges as the victor?

403
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,583
[VEGETA] Hm!

404
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,291
Gee, I don't know...

405
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,708
They don't seem all
that strong to me, guys.

406
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,416
To tell the truth,
I don't think they know

407
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,375
what they're getting
themselves into.

408
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:27,833
[VEGETA] Well, we'll find
out soon enough, won't we?

409
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,500
I, for one, will be more than
happy to take on either

410
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,166
of those two clowns.

411
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,208
[NARRATOR]
Two strangers have appeared

412
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,041
at the World Martial
Arts Tournament.

413
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,916
What does their
eerie presence portend?

414
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Are they really as strong
as Goku says they are?

415
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,041
On the next episode
of Dragon Ball Z!
