1
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,625
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,166
The battle
against Vegeta

3
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,833
had become a pure test
of will for Goku,

4
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,291
as he desperately
sought to match

5
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,500
the ever-increasing power
of his Saiyan foe.

6
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,791
[NARRATOR] Struggling
under the weight of Vegeta's

7
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,666
Gallic Gun attack,
Goku was forced to take his

8
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,625
Kaio-Ken Attack
up one more level,

9
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,416
sending the dumbfounded
Vegeta hurtling toward

10
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,041
the edge of the atmosphere.

11
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,958
Raaugh! Noo!

12
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,416
[NARRATOR]
Battered but not broken,

13
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,916
Vegeta returned
vowing to show Goku

14
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,291
the ultimate power
of the Saiyans...

15
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:54,583
A transformation of
unbelievable proportions.

16
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:00,208
[NARRATOR] As Vegeta's
transformation nears completion,

17
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,500
Goku can only
stand by and watch.

18
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,791
With his strength
all but gone,

19
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,875
will Goku have anything
left to fend off

20
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:09,125
this supreme
Saiyan Monster?

21
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,541
Don't miss the
action... Today!

22
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,083
We're almost to
Kame House, Gohan.

23
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,708
You can make it, c'mon.

24
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah. I can tell we're
getting closer now, Krillin.

25
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,416
[KRILLIN chuckles]

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,875
Huh?

27
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,333
[GOHAN] Hey, don't
slow down now, Krillin.

28
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,833
We're almost there.

29
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,708
[KRILLIN] I don't remember
that light being there before...

30
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,541
Look! Gohan!

31
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,583
Uh--Huh?

32
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,708
What is that, Krillin?
Is that the moon?

33
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,125
No, Piccolo completely
destroyed the moon...

34
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,708
I have no idea
what it is.

35
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,958
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,583
[GOHAN]
That's where my Dad is!

37
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:15,166
[KRILLIN and GOHAN yell]

38
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,583
[APE VEGETA roaring]

39
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,958
What's... What's happening?

40
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,041
He's totally changed.

41
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,208
How am I supposed to
fight a giant ape?

42
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:57,916
[KRILLIN] Something really
big is happening right now!

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,625
[GOHAN] Yeah, I feel it, too.

44
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:03,625
But, I don't think that energy
is coming from my dad, Krillin.

45
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,750
No, this is definitely
coming from the other guy.

46
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,375
But Goku will know
what to do against

47
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:13,291
a force like this.
I wish I could help.

48
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:17,541
[GOHAN whimpering]

49
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,208
[GOHAN] D... Daddy...

50
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,875
[KRILLIN]
He'll be all right.

51
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,666
I... don't think so.

52
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,583
[KRILLIN] Your dad is
stronger than you think.

53
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,250
[GOHAN] Krillin... I have
to go back to him.

54
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,958
Stop!

55
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,958
[KRILLIN] There isn't anything
that you could do.

56
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,125
[GOHAN] I can feel it...
My Dad needs my help...

57
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,125
If I don't go back my
he's going to lose.

58
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,500
I can't leave him.

59
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,583
But, what is it you
think you can do to help?

60
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:00,791
[GOHAN] I don't know...
But I have to try.

61
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:05,125
I can't just sit around waiting
to find out what happens.

62
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,541
Try not to worry... 
Goku can handle himself.

63
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:12,083
Don't you remember what
he did to that big guy?

64
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,583
He couldn't
even stand up

65
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,583
when your dad was
finished with him.

66
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:20,333
Yeah... But something's...

67
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,708
[GOHAN whimpering]

68
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,916
...not right!

69
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,708
I'm going to go help
him no matter what!

70
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,833
Gohan! Wait!

71
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,625
You can't
go alone!

72
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,583
[APE VEGETA]
Goodbye, Kakarot!

73
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,500
[APE VEGETA roaring]

74
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,833
Raaugh!

75
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,500
[APE VEGETA laughing]

76
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,291
Go ahead and run...

77
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,041
because you can't hide.
Heh, heh.

78
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,125
[APE VEGETA laughing]

79
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,375
This guy's
really fast!

80
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:13,083
[APE VEGETA roaring]

81
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:22,291
His new form seems
familiar to me.

82
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,416
[APE VEGETA laughing]

83
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,166
If you had known what
you were capable of,

84
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,750
you would have never let
them take your tail!

85
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:34,833
But now it is I who will show
you the true Saiyan might!

86
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,291
[APE VEGETA roars]

87
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,208
Aah!

88
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,041
[GRANDPA GOHAN] Goku,
on the night of a full moon,

89
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,291
a giant monster-ape
comes out

90
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:51,375
and does truly terrible
things... You must beware.

91
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,625
We could take this awful
power from him now,

92
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,375
but some day he will
know the truth...

93
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,375
It will always be
part of who he is...

94
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:07,875
[APE GOKU roaring]

95
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,333
[thinking] I think I'm finally
beginning to understand.

96
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,250
[thinking] The giant monster
my Grandpa warned me about...

97
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,958
It was me!

98
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,708
[APE VEGETA chuckling]

99
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,208
Yes, I get it now.

100
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,708
I'm the one who
destroyed the stadium

101
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:27,083
at the World
Tournament,

102
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:31,708
and I'm the one who...
who-who crushed my Grandpa!

103
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:37,958
[thinking] Why didn't
anyone tell me?

104
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,916
All these years...
Master Roshi and the others,

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,583
they must have
known the truth,

106
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,916
must have seen me
transform into this... thing.

107
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,250
[thinking]
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

108
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,666
I don't know if there's any
way I can make it up to you...

109
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,625
But I'm gonna try!

110
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,666
Hyaah!

111
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,625
[APE VEGETA growling]

112
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:07,416
[YAJIROBE] What's going on
here? Oh, man...

113
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,208
I... I think maybe I
should help Goku.

114
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,750
Yeah, if I can
come from behind...

115
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,625
But, probably I should wait...
I need to plan this out.

116
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,458
There's just one
way to stop him...

117
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:26,458
The power of
the Spirit Bomb!

118
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,291
I just hope there's
enough time!

119
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,041
[KING KAI] Goku!

120
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,833
His only option will be
the Spirit Bomb!

121
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,000
If he can manage to
pull one together

122
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,500
and blast it
at Vegeta,

123
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,750
he might just make it
out of this alive.

124
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,208
Aah!

125
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:10,458
[APE VEGETA roaring]

126
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,916
Now, Kaio-Ken
attack!

127
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,291
[APE VEGETA laughing]

128
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,750
[APE VEGETA] You think
you can outmaneuver me?

129
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:31,291
Come on! You can
do better than that!

130
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,416
[BABA]
This is bad!

131
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,833
[ROSHI] Oh no,
is it Goku?

132
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,583
[BABA] Yes, but the
image isn't clear...

133
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,166
What is it,
Roshi?

134
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,083
[CHICHI] What happened?

135
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,708
[BABA]
I saw a bright light.

136
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,208
Did you
see them?

137
00:10:56,291 --> 00:11:00,291
[BABA] Goku's power must
have increased... Wait...

138
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,458
But, that means Goku
must've won, right?

139
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,250
[BABA] Please wait...

140
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,541
[ALL] Goku!

141
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,750
Ohh, is he okay?

142
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,708
He'd better be...

143
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,958
Well, he's
not dead yet.

144
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,041
I wonder what could
have happened to him.

145
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,625
Oh no!
Look at the Saiyan!

146
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:24,416
It's incredible. How did he
transform without the moon?!

147
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,583
What's wrong with Goku?
He isn't fighting!

148
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,791
Why is he just laying
there like that?!

149
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,416
Tell me what
happened to him!

150
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,208
Tell me what happened
to my Goku now!

151
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,958
Oh, Spirits hear
me as I wail,

152
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,333
show the Saiyan
with no tail...

153
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,541
[BABA]
It's coming through.

154
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,333
Perhaps this new angle will
show us what we need to know.

155
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,625
[BULMA] Hey... Who is that
sitting down there?

156
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,375
Is that Yajirobe?

157
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,958
[BULMA] Yajirobe!
What are you doing?

158
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,708
Why aren't you
trying to help Goku?!

159
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,458
Rrgh! He can't hear us!

160
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,416
Ohh! Hey!

161
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,166
Oh, Goku...

162
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,208
ChiChi!

163
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,708
[thinking] Hold on, Dad.
We're coming as fast as we can.

164
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,708
[thinking] Gohan
sure is determined.

165
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,625
He's becoming more
like his dad every day.

166
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,458
Guh!

167
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,458
[APE VEGETA laughing]

168
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't you think it's time to
give up, Kakarot?

169
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,041
You're finished!

170
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,083
He's incredibly fast
for someone so big.

171
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,666
I don't have the time
I need to concentrate

172
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,000
so I can form
the Spirit Bomb.

173
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,666
Even if the Kaio-Ken Attack
was ten times stronger,

174
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,208
I still couldn't
defeat him!

175
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:52,166
So, you won't attack me, huh?
Fine, then I'll attack you!

176
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,833
I have to have at least
ten more seconds.

177
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,833
I need that
time to concentrate.

178
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,458
[APE VEGETA roaring]

179
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,208
[roaring continues]

180
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:29,333
[GOKU] Huh? The sun...
Yes, that's it!

181
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,458
[GOKU] Just one more
look over here...

182
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,750
Solar Flare!

183
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:43,833
[APE VEGETA yelling]

184
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,041
Now's my chance. I have to
put some distance between us!

185
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,000
[APE VEGETA] Aaah!
My eyes! My eyes!

186
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,458
[APE VEGETA moaning]

187
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,416
This should be far
enough... I hope.

188
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,125
[GOKU] Fine, here we go.
The rivers. The trees. The wind.

189
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,625
All the living
things in nature...

190
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,791
Please offer
me your energy!

191
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,750
I ask of you...
Please!

192
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,875
[APE VEGETA howling]

193
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,083
I can't see!
Curse you, Kakarot!

194
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,916
Aargh!

195
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,375
[thinking]
I have to take my time

196
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,750
or it won't be
formed right...

197
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,958
I have to relax...

198
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,916
[YAJIROBE] I guess he
doesn't need me yet.

199
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,041
[GOKU thinking]
I almost have enough...

200
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,500
The power is
coming to me...

201
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,791
I can feel all of it
completely surrounding me...

202
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,291
Just a little
bit more...

203
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,166
[thinking] This is it...
This is my chance...

204
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,416
Now, while he's
still recovering...

205
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,791
I only have one
shot at this...

206
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,291
I have to
make it count.

207
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,166
Where is he?
Where is he?

208
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:28,833
[APE VEGETA] You can run
all you want, Kakarot!

209
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:32,083
But I will find you!
Do you hear me?!

210
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,875
[APE VEGETA growling]

211
00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:01,458
[APE VEGETA howling]

212
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,375
[thinking] Come on,
Spirit Bomb! I need to hurry!

213
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,916
[APE VEGETA] I can feel
his power. Where is he?

214
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,375
Rrgh!

215
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,208
[thinking]
Here it comes, alright,

216
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,833
I feel it getting
closer now...

217
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,958
There. It's done...

218
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,166
If this won't stop him,
then nothing will.

219
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,666
[APE VEGETA roaring]

220
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,875
Got it!

221
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:43,500
[roaring continues]

222
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,416
Nghaah!

223
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,916
[GOKU growling]

224
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,666
[GOKU] Wooaah!

225
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,625
[YAJIROBE yelling]

226
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,666
Look... Look over there!

227
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,916
[KRILLIN] Hey, isn't that
blast about where Goku is?

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,208
[GOHAN] Hurry, Krillin!

229
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,833
There's no telling what's
going on down there!

230
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,541
[APE VEGETA chuckling]

231
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,916
[APE VEGETA] Well, I guess that
does it for the great hero

232
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,250
of this puny
little planet.

233
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:33,666
Pity, I was just beginning
to enjoy the challenge.

234
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:39,125
[chuckling]

235
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,583
Huh?!

236
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:47,541
[GOKU grunting]

237
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:55,625
[grunting continues]

238
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,666
I never thought that he would
counter attack that way.

239
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,000
Boy, what a
mistake that was.

240
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,625
I only needed just a
few more seconds

241
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,958
and he would've
been gone for good.

242
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,416
Okay, that does it. I've given
you too many chances...

243
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,083
That was your last.

244
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,666
Wow, my body feels so weak
I can barely stand up...

245
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,208
I must have used
up all my power

246
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,708
trying to draw
in that energy.

247
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,541
Aww... You look
so scared...

248
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,958
Let me put you out of your
misery, once and for all!

249
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,083
[APE VEGETA roaring]

250
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:59,875
[APE VEGETA roaring]

251
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,208
[GOKU screaming]

252
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,875
It feels like someone's
power is starting to fade.

253
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,833
Yes, my Daddy's.

254
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,625
[KRILLIN] We're close.
Let's hurry!

255
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:24,833
[GOKU screaming,
APE VEGETA laughing]

256
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:28,208
[GOKU screaming]

257
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:33,500
[GOKU moaning]

258
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,208
Whoops. Sorry about that.

259
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,750
Apparently I've accidentally
squashed both of your legs.

260
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,333
[APE VEGETA laughing]

261
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,333
I guess that means you can't
run from me any more now.

262
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,958
I have to admit, you've been an
interesting challenge, Kakarot.

263
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,000
But in your heart,
you must have known

264
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,583
it would end
this way.

265
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:04,666
I just can't
believe this is it.

266
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,416
It was great testing
my abilities and all,

267
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,291
but unless I do
something fast...

268
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,708
He'll overpower me.
Alright then...

269
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:17,833
[APE VEGETA laughing]

270
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:26,041
[APE VEGETA roaring]

271
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,291
[GOKU] Hrrgh!

272
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,750
Aargh!

273
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:37,958
[APE VEGETA wailing]

274
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,291
That was my last
bit of energy...

275
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:51,250
I have no more power to defend
myself against this monster.

276
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:54,208
I hope it buys
me some time.

277
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:59,791
[APE VEGETA moaning]

278
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,500
Damn you! What have you
done to my face, Kakarot?!

279
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,625
Now you're
going to pay!

280
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,125
[GOKU grunting]

281
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,916
[APE VEGETA] I'll destroy you!

282
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,166
[APE VEGETA roaring]

283
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,208
[GOKU screaming]

284
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:43,708
[screaming continues]

285
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,625
[NARRATOR]
Unable to defend himself,

286
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,916
Goku is now caught in
the paralyzing grip

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,500
of the monster Vegeta.

288
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:52,291
Is there anything that can save
our hero from certain doom?

289
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,625
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
