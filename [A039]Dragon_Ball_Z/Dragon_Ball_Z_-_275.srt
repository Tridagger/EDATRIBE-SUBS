00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:15,458
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,250
Vegeta and Goku were
searching Majin Buu's head

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,041
for Gohan and the others.

4
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,333
[VEGETA] Okay, use your
instincts, Kakarot.

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,000
Right or left?

6
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:29,041
[GOKU]
Hmm? I'd have to say... Left.

7
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,916
[VEGETA]
Good. Then I'm going right.

8
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:33,666
[GOKU yells]

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,166
[GOKU]
That's not very nice.

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,291
[GOKU] You follow
your instincts, Kakarot.

11
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,166
I'll follow mine.

12
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,166
Fine. Have it your way.

13
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:44,250
[NARRATOR] At last, good fortune
seemed to be smiling,

14
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,166
but Gohan wasn't.

15
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,166
Had Goku really found
his long lost son?

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,083
No. It was an imposter.

17
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,666
[GOKU] I can tell by
looking into your eyes

18
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,125
that you're not my son.

19
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,583
[NARRATOR] Vegeta was
battling equally dangerous

20
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,333
thought creations.

21
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,500
One had assumed
the form of Piccolo

22
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,458
in this funhouse of evil.

23
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:04,833
[VEGETA grunts]

24
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,291
Fool.

25
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,375
[NARRATOR] The other had taken
on the familiar form of Gotenks

26
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,041
to carry out Buu's
twisted purpose.

27
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,250
[GOTENKS grunts]

28
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,791
[VEGETA] Fighting both of those
idiots at once is pretty tough.

29
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,833
Where is that idiot
clown when you need him?

30
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,875
[NARRATOR]
But even with Goku's help,

31
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,208
the duo had no chance
against an enemy

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,041
that couldn't be destroyed.

33
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,166
[GOKU yelps]

34
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,958
[NARRATOR]
But lo and behold.

35
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,791
When Buu's concentration
shifted to sweets,

36
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,833
so did his thought forms.

37
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,541
And precious time was gained

38
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,666
to resume the search
for their sons and Piccolo.

39
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,875
[GOKU]
Now where could they have gone?

40
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,416
Over here. Take a look.

41
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,708
[NARRATOR]
Could it be?

42
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,750
Did Goku and Vegeta
find their boys at last?

43
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,583
[GOKU]
Hey.

44
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,666
Trunks and Goten have separated.

45
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,458
The Fusion Technique
must not work in here either.

46
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,458
No, not necessarily.

47
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,625
It could be just that their
fusion time has expired.

48
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:35,875
[VEGETA] Yes. Buu's thought
forms did perform the Fusion.

49
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:38,083
Perhap's you're right.

50
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,500
I hope so.

51
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,208
We're going to need every
advantage that we can get.

52
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:56,041
[chuckles]

53
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,041
[MR. SATAN]
Aiyee! Careful!

54
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,333
[SUPER BUU]
Mmm. Yum-yums...

55
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:08,208
[whimpers, laughs]

56
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,208
Hey. W-What's the deal?
Why are we sinking?

57
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,333
Would you back off?!
I'm not a super-hero!

58
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,083
[glass shatters]

59
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,083
[growls]

60
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,708
{BEE whimpers]

61
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,458
Twenty-five cake shops
down the hatch. Now.

62
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,916
[yelps]

63
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,750
[SUPER BUU laughs]

64
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,541
We're hitting some turbulence.

65
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,458
[DENDE]
It's not turbulence.

66
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:48,083
If it's not
turbulence, w-what is it?

67
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,541
Engine failure.

68
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,375
[sighs]

69
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,083
[MR. SATAN yells,
BEE yelps]

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,625
[MR. SATAN whimpers]

71
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,666
[DENDE]
I'm so sorry! Are you okay?!

72
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,083
Luckily, I landed on my head.

73
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,833
[whimpers]

74
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:19,625
This explosion will
light up all of space.

75
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,250
And planet Earth
will disappear forever.

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,791
[GOKU]
These things are weird.

77
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,250
They're squishy.

78
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,500
[GOKU]
It's kind of like an eggplant.

79
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,750
[VEGETA] Stand aside, Kakarot.
It's harvest time.

80
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,416
[GOKU yells, grunts]

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,166
[VEGETA] Or, maybe instead
of sitting around,

82
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,625
you can help me out.

83
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:01,125
[SUPER BUU whimpers]

84
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,583

[SUPER BUU grunts, yells]

87
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,500
My body.

88
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,791
What have they done?
Fools. I'll kill them!

89
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,375
[OLD KAI]
Woo-hoo! [laughs]

90
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,125
[KIBITO KAI]
Yes!

91
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,583
[BOTH laugh]

92
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,791
[OLD KAI]
It worked! It worked!

93
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,125
[KIBITO KAI]
Yes-yes-yes!

94
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,291
[laughing continues]

95
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,958
[BOTH retch, cough]

96
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:37,875
[BOTH laugh]

97
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,208
[GOKU]
Oh, yeah. Feel that?

98
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,166
Majin Buu's
changed back, all right.

99
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,291
What a difference!

100
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,375
[VEGETA]
Most definitely.

101
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:54,208
What a decrease. I like
the odds a lot better now.

102
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,833
Yes. Now let's blast
our way out of here.

103
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,291
Right.

104
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,041
Wait. Hold on just a second.

105
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,583
Even though he's a lot weaker,
we're still no match for him.

106
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:11,541
If we go out there right now,
he's going to kill us.

107
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,875
It's a problem, all right...
But there's one way we can win!

108
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,166
You can forget it,
Kakarot. No way.

109
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,583
I haven't even said what
it is yet, spoiled sport.

110
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:27,916
There's no need.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,625
It begins with an F and
ends with an N. Am I right?

112
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,291
[GOKU]
Hey. Good guess.

113
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,750
[GOKU hums excitedly]

114
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:40,041
Come on. It only
lasts for 30 minutes

115
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,916
and then it's all over.
See? Huh-huh? Huh?

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,291
No way.

117
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,208
But it's only temporary.

118
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:51,458
That pose is not fit for a
Saiyan Warrior. It's too prissy.

119
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,625
What? Is that all?

120
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,208
What do you mean,
"Is that all"?!

121
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:00,333
That's enough! Where's your
dignity?! We're Saiyans!

122
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,041
Hmm? But no one's
going to see us.

123
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,291
Gosh, Vegeta.
Is it really that bad?

124
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,500
[growls]

125
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,208
We're fighters, not
ballet dancers, you oaf!

126
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:10,666
[growls]

127
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,666
Huh? Kakarot.

128
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,583
Look. You're not
going to believe this.

129
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,666
Huh? Majin Buu!
In his original form...

130
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,333
[VEGETA] Yes. I see that.
But what does it mean?

131
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,500
Who knows? How could he absorb
himself? Doesn't make sense.

132
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,958
Wow. This is deep.
Two Buus. Strange.

133
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,208
Maybe there were two Buus at
one time and this one lost.

134
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,083
[VEGETA]
You can't be serious?

135
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,416
[OLD KAI]
Uh-oh. Dadgum thing! Junk!

136
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,625
That's what it is!

137
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,083
They just don't make
'em like they used to!

138
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:10,166
But, Sir! I created
that one myself!

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We could try to read
his mind. How 'bout it?

140
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,750
[VEGETA]
Hmm. I don't see why not.

141
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,416
Unless there's some kind
of strange energy block

142
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,083
like there was
with the earrings.

143
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,916
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,166
[GOKU] I guess there's
only one way to find out.

145
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,625
[VEGETA] Well, I suppose so.
Let's give it a go.

146
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,125
Go now!

[MR. SATAN]
B-B-Buu a-ate Buu!

153
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,333
Wow. So there really
were two Majin Buus.

154
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,083
A nice one and a mean one.

155
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:53,125
Huh...

156
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,291
[VEGETA]
And old ugly won the battle.

157
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:01,041
[SUPER BUU] Who are you calling
"ugly," you ridiculous fool?

158
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,166
[GOKU]
Uh-oh.

159
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,416
[VEGETA] How can he be
inside of his own body?!

160
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,750
The real question is:

161
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,500
Why haven't you
two been absorbed yet?

162
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:14,166
And how dare you tamper
with my people pods?!

163
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,041
[SUPER BUU snarls]

164
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,250
[VEGETA]
Kakarot!

165
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,208
I think we're in trouble.

166
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,250
Well, why did you have
to crush your earring?!

167
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,958
You could've stuck
it in your pocket,

168
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,583
but no! You had to fix it
so we can never fuse again!

169
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,291
Thank you very much.

170
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,750
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

171
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,916
I see. So you can't
join bodies anymore.

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,166
[VEGETA]
Nice work.

173
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,208
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell him?

174
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,458

I think I know how to get
that smirk off your ugly mug.

I'm gonna renovate your face.

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,958
Funny, huh? All right, then.
Allow me to add a skylight.

182
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,791
Go ahead. Try it.

183
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,666

Yes. That's not good.

188
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:22,166
I felt it. It was
like a mosquito bite.

189
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,250
But for an
miniature guy like you

190
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,125
who's actually
smaller than a flea...

191
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,708
...that's... not so bad.

192
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,000
[GOKU] All right, then. We'll
escape and regain our size.

I don't know about that.

Too bad. I guess we lost him.

[DENDE]
No, I can sense his spirit.

206
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,833
He's actually very close.

[gasps]

208
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,791
Wha-What do you mean,
you sense him?

209
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:37,416
That's right. Majin Buu's
energy signal, I can feel it.

210
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,208
What? Can I learn, too?
To sense things?

211
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,666
[DENDE] Sure. But you have to
relax and calm the mind.

212
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,458
I usually close my eyes.

What in the world is he doing?

217
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,083
He's like a statue.

[MR. SATAN whimpers]

219
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,541
He looks different.
What's the deal?

220
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:22,333
[gasps] You're right!
That's his previous form.

221
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,083

Well, one pop

the rest of this dance.
