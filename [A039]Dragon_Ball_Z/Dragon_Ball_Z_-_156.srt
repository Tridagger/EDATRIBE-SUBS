Last time on Dragon Ball Z...

the hidden androids.

soon realized their safe hiding
place wasn't so safe anymore.

00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,041
With Cell closing in

9
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,583
they would either
have to surrender

10
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:40,833
to the synthetic serpent,
or they'd be reduced to scrap.

an Earth-shaking energy blast

14

that would expose the androids
when suddenly two unexpected

the digital duo from disaster.

All of our training!

[VEGETA chuckles]

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,916
[TRUNKS] Spending an entire year
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,541
was the most difficult
task I've ever had to face.

77
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,333
The gravity was so
intense I could barely walk.

78
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,916
The air was so thick
I could hardly breathe.

79
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,500
And the temperature
fluctuated wildly!

80
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,125
Sometimes freezing cold,
and others raging hot.

81
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,083
Everyday presented
its own hardship

82
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:42,958
a new obstacle to be
met and overcome.

83
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,708
Of course, some days
were harder than others!

84
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,958
[TRUNKS] And just when
I'd given up all hope,

85
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,333
when I was sure that I
wouldn't last another moment

86
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,541
in that awful place...

87
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,958
...I saw him.

88
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,333
He stood at the heart
of that raging inferno,

89
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,750
enshrouded by the flames

90
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,375
thousands of fiery
tongues licking at his body,

91
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,708
threatening to swallow him into
the furious blaze completely!

92
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,541
What?! No! Noo!

93
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,875
[TRUNKS] In that instant,

94
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,916
all of my fears and all of
my pain dropped away!

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,250
I knew only that
I had to be strong!

96
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,291
I had to step through
that wall of flame!

97
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
I had to do it for him!

00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,625

00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:33,000

need your help.

Stay away.

102
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,208
[TRUNKS] Suddenly
everything became clear.

103
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,041
Those raging flames
hadn't been a product

104
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,583
of the time chamber at all!

105
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,916
They had come from him,

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,791
their intensity fueled by
the one burning desire

107
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,000
that consumed him...
the desire to be the best!

108
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:55,625
I knew then that my
father would reach his goal.

109
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,625
He would achieve an
unprecedented new power level!

110

He would surpass a Super Saiyan!

00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,833
I was left to face the
trials of the void alone!

A seemingly endless

my mind and my body

been closer to the
breaking point!

persisted, the enormous shadow

achieve the greatness

mountain that stood in his path!

follow in his footsteps.
