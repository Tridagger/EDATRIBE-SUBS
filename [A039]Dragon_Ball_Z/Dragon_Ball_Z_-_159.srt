[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,041
it looked as though Vegeta
had the upperhand on Cell.

00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,541
But don't count
Cell out quite yet.

5
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,833
Knowing of the Saiyan's
thirst for battle,

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,250
he lured Vegeta into
a mind-boggling agreement.

7
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,875
Now go and absorb your android.

8
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:38,708
Hopefully the next

00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,250
you won't be in
such a pitiful state.

10
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,291
It's embarassing!

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,458

allowing Cell to power up

12
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,750

[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
Krillin held the fate

17
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:03,208
of the other Androids in the
palm of his hands... literally.

18
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,916
With one flick of the switch,

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,666
Krillin could shut down
Android 18 for good,

20
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,833

reaching his completion.

[NARRATOR] But at the
crucial moment of decision,

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,791
Krillin opted to spare the
beautiful android's life.

25
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,250
You shouldn't be here.

26
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,208
Look, if cell finds you,
then we're all doomed!

27
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,583
Please go.

28
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,500
[NARRATOR] Has Krillin's
fit of compassion

29
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,125
sealed the planet's fate?

30
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,208
And if things
weren't bad enough,

31
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,000
Cell has stumbled
upon the alcove

32
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,041
where the androids are hiding.

33
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,916
[NARRATOR] The scales of victory
are tipping in Cell's favor,

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,541
today on Dragon Ball Z!

00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,208
They haven't noticed
we're up here!

44
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,500
You could've shut me down
but you didn't.

But Cell is hot on your tail and
he'll do anything to absorb you!

And if that happens,
the entire planet is doomed!
