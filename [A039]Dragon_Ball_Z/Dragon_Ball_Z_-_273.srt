00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,541
Majin Buu restored Vegito
to his humanoid form

3
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:22,625
after a painful bout
with the calamitous candy!

4
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,875
[VEGITO]
Oh, it's me again!

5
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:28,208
[NARRATOR] But, big or small,
the pain remains the same

6
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,666
when dealing with the synthesis

7
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,958
of Super Saiyan legends!

8
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,333
[VEGITO] Is this how you
want it to end? Huh?

9
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,458
So much for the tough warrior!

10
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,000
[NARRATOR] When his last
desperate attempt failed,

11
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,291
it was time for
the final countdown!

12
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,000
Vegito had had enough!

13
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:52,500
[VEGITO] I'm going to
count to ten, Buu!

14
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,625
[NARRATOR] But rising like
dough in a hot oven

15
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,416
was a perfect
recipe for disaster!

16
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,750
[NARRATOR] Silently, it
stalked its prey and struck!

17
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:07,916
Consuming Vegito
in one swallow!

18
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,458
[NARRATOR] Had Majin Buu
done the impossible

19
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,125
and, against all odds,

20
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:18,916
toppled the greatest
fighter in the Universe?

21
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:37,166
[cackling]

22
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,583
You fool! Oh yeah!
Who's on top now?

23
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:49,750
Majin Buu! Me! You big
loud-mouthed jerk!

24
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:57,916
[laughs]

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,708
Yeah!

26
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,041
[KIBITO KAI]
I failed!

27
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:15,083
Despite all my power,
I failed! Sir,

28
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,666
I'm a disgrace to the Kai line!

29
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,833
[KIBITO KAI]
It's over! The Earth is doomed!

30
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,583
The entire physical Universe
is at the mercy of Majin Buu!

31
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,583
[OLD KAI]
Maybe. Maybe not!

32
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,833
[KIBITO KAI]
Huh?

33
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,333
Lookee! Notice
something strange?

34
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,125
[KIBITO KAI]
Hm? No!

35
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:39,375
Come now! Take a closer look!

36
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,708
In the past, when Majin
Buu absorbed his victims,

37
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,458
he mutated and took on some
of their characteristics!

38
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,625
Hey, you're right!

39
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,458
He looks exactly the
same as he did before!

40
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,333
But, but just
what does it mean?

41
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:57,833
[OLD KAI]
It means it's not over yet!

42
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,833
He's having trouble
digesting those two!

43
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:03,083
I have that problem
with Mexican food!

44
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:13,583
[SUPER BUU]
Yeah!

45
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:24,875
[SUPER BUU laughing]

46
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,833
[laughing]

47
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,333
[SUPER BUU yells]

48
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,958
[SUPER BUU cackles]

49
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,916
[SUPER BUU yelling]

50
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:30,708
[SUPER BUU cackling]

51
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,625
[cackling]

52
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,875
[SUPER BUU]
I should've saved some people!

53
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,750
It's not as fun without hearing
their ridiculous cries for help!

54
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,708
Whew.

55
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,000
I could've been killed!

56
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,625
[DENDE]
Mr. Satan, are you okay?

57
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,291
Okay?! Just what is there
to be okay about? Huh?

58
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:37,166
Well, it seemed as if Vegito was
going to win there for a while!

59
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,333
But now the future of the Earth
is in the hands of Majin Buu!

60
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:42,666
What are you talkin' about?

61
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,708
You're supposed to be
the Guardian of the Earth!

62
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,333
So come on and do somethin',

63
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:49,041
use that power of
yours to beat 'im!

64
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,000
[DENDE]
Sorry! I would if I could!

65
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,125
But it's beyond
my power to do that!

66
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,416
Now, put me down!

67
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,833
[MR. SATAN] What am
I doin'? I'm sorry, Dende!

68
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,708
I'm losin' my head!

69
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,791
--[BEE yips]
--[MR. SATAN, DENDE] Huh?

70
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,291
[SUPER BUU cackling]

71
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,958
[BOTH gasping]

72
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,958
Hit the deck!

73
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,791
[SUPER BUU] What a
beautiful place to destroy!

74
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:36,000
Except, I'm wondering...
Why haven't I changed?

75
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,708
Oh, well! That guy was
tougher than I thought!

76
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,708
He might take a while to digest!

77
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,958
But when he does,

78
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,791
my power will jump to a level

79
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,625
that will truly
be unsurpassable!

80
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,666
There will be no one left who
has the audacity to stop me!

81
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,208
Soon, I will be
the sole proprietor

82
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,791
of the entire Universe!

83
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:11,291
[laughing]

84
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,375
[VEGITO] Ew! Doesn't get any
more disgusting than this!

85
00:09:53,458 --> 00:10:02,166
[SUPER BUU cackling]

86
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,625
Give me a break! Ah, fruitcake!
It's bad enough to be in here!

87
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:11,208
But to have to endure that
ridiculous laughter of his...!

88
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,833
On the bright side,
the barrier did the trick!

89
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:17,208
He hasn't been able to
turn me into Buu goo!

90
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,958
Well, I'd better get busy!

91
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:26,416
Finding a way out of this
place won't be a picnic!

92
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,125
The others are still
in here somewhere!

93
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,166
I can feel it! But where?

94
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,250
[OLD KAI]
I don't believe it!

95
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:40,000
He actually got sucked in
on purpose! What a guy!

96
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:44,083
He wanted to rescue the others
before he annihilated Majin Buu!

97
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,833
He's fantastic!

98
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:49,125
[OLD KAI] Let's just hope
his plan doesn't backfire!

99
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,416
[sighs]

100
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,666
Huh? Ah!

101
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,541
[GOKU yells]

102
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,500
[GOKU groans]

103
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,083
[VEGETA groans]

104
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,500
[GOKU]
I-I don't get it!

105
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,791
Why did our bodies separate
when we let the barrier down?

106
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,666
How would I know?!

107
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,000
How bizarre!

108
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,458
I was told that once you
and I were joined together

109
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,500
by these earrings,
we could never separate!

110
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,791
Well then, I guess
we lucked out!

111
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:32,583
I'm me! And you're you, Kakarot!

112
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:36,166
And that's just the way
I like it! So, there!

113
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,416
Hey! What are you doing?
Put that back on!

114
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,458
[GOKU] We'll probably
fuse together again

115
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,875
as soon as we leave Buu's body!

116
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,875
But, if we're not ready,
we could blow our chance!

117
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,500
[crunching]

118
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,875
Huh?

119
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:53,791
[yelps]

120
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:54,500
[BOTH gasp]

121
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,458
He crushed it!

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,708
Vegeta! Have you
lost your mind?!

123
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,041
Now there's no way for
us to join bodies again!

124
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,375
Why do you have
to be like that?

125
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,166
Isn't it worth you and
I being stuck together

126
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,916
if we can beat Buu?

127
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No! I perfer to be
the captain of my own ship!

128
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,333
Besides, we can beat
him anyway, Kakarot!

129
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,125
How do you know that? Huh?

130
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,000
Even if we do manage to get
Gohan and the others out,

131
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,833
there's no guarantee that
Buu is going to change back

132
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,583
to the way he was before!

133
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,500
Well, I guess it's going to be
very interesting to find out,

134
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,791
isn't it?

135
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,833
Well, yeah! I mean, no!

136
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,000
[VEGETA]
Come now! You'd better hurry!

137
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,166
Buu could blow up
the world any minute now!

138
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,333
Fine! Have it your way.

139
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,000

00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:30,125
[GOKU]
How do you know this is the way?

142
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,916
[VEGETA]
I don't.

143
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:40,833
Whoa! It really stinks
in here! You know it?

144
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,333
[VEGETA]
Yes! It's disgusting!

145
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,166
And, uh, thanks for
pointing out the obvious.

146
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,333
[GOKUI] We must be close
to the bowels or something!

147
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,166
It's really nasty!

Uh? What? It's got me, too!
What the heck is it?

151
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,333
I... can't get... can't get...

Oh, man! Ugh!

156
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,458
[VEGETA] Well, now we know
where that disgusting smell

157
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,250
is coming from!

158
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,916

Look at this place!

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
Doesn't he eat
anything but sweets?

160
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, he's worse than a child!
This is revolting!

161
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,583
Not a singal bit
of meat at all!

Huh? Oh, wow!
What's that smoke?

163
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:56,125
Huh? Idiot!
You're being digested!

164
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,791
That smoke is coming from your
roasting carcass, you moron!

[VEGETA]
What are we going to do?

172
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,916
[GOKU] We're going to get
sucked into that hole!

173
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,166
[VEGETA] No, Kakarot! I mean,
how are we going to stop it?!

174
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:41,625
[VEGETA]
Huh?

175
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,958
Well, I think it's too late...

176
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,458
[GOKU]
Uh-oh!

177
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,625
Man! Some rescue
operation this is!

178
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,875
[VEGETA] I will not suffer the
same fate as cream filling!

179
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:59,916
[VEGETA, GOKU yelping]

180
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,041
[GOKU thinking]
Got to think of something fast!

181
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,125
We're out of time! Hm?

182
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,958
[GOKU muffled]
Mm? Vegeta!

183
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,291
[VEGETA grunts]

184
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:37,416
[SUPER BUU] Uhh! Indigestion!
Must've been the meat I ate!

185
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,958
Darn him!

186
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,708
Even going down,
he's a royal pain.

187
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:45,458
Soon, he'll be something
you wipe off your shoe!

188
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,208
[GOKU, VEGETA yell]

189
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,041
[GOKU, VEGETA yell]

190
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,458
Phew! That was close,

191
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,791
but I think you and I

192
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,541
might want to be a little
more discreet down here

193
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,125
so Majin Buu doesn't figure
out that we're still alive!

194
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,708
[VEGETA]
Oh! I see!

195
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,666
We should have just gone quietly
down that little hole like mice

196
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,500
and become part of
Majin Buu's excretions?!

197
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,208
Ha! No thanks, Kakarot!
I'm a true Saiyan!

198
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,625
I'm going out the front door!
Now let's get a move on!

199
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,500
The Earth is on a
short fuse right now!

200
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:45,500
[GOKU] I don't know how I ever
managed without you, Vegeta!

201
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,500
[GOKU]
I don't know how he does it!

202
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,625
You'd think that he
would just keel over

203
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,500
from eating this many sweets!

204
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,833
[VEGETA] Oh, you have no
room to talk, Kakarot!

205
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,416
Oh, I've seen you eat desert!

206
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,333
Ho! As bad as it seems,

207
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,083
I'd much rather be down here

208
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:15,208
than in your stomach after
one of your pig-out sessions!

209
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,416
[giggles] You're kidding!

210
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,416
[VEGETA]
No, I'm not! Huh?

211
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,750
What? What's wrong?

212
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,625
Quiet!

213
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:27,625
Listen! Do you hear that?

214
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,750
[rapidly pulsing beat]

215
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,875
Yes! What is it?

216
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,958
[VEGETA]
I don't know. But I don't

217
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,750
have a very good
feeling about this.

218
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,166
[GOKU]
Me either!

219
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,000
[VEGETA] What direction
is it coming from?

220
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:54,541
[GOKU] It seems to be
coming from every direction!

221
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,666
[VEGETA] Precisely! We're being
surrounded! But by what?

222
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:01,916
There!

223
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,125
[VEGETA]
Look out!

224
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:15,500
[GOKU] Hm... Hey there!
What's up, little guys!

225
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,708
Ow!

226
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,666
[VEGETA laughs]

227
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,791
Oh, he almost defeated
the great Kakarot!

228
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,291
[GOKU]
Get out!

229
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,166
Look! Voracious little
rascals, aren't they?

230
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,166
[VEGETA] Yes, they are.
Little savages, all right!

231
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,916
There's millions of them!
I mean... what are they?

232
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,458
That's what I was wondering.

233
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,000
Look at 'em go!

234
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:45,166
It's possible they roam
about breaking down any food

235
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,000
or whatnot that doesn't
make it into the intestines!

236
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,833
[GOKU] I think we fit into
that category, don't we?!

237
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,916
[VEGETA] Yes, but I doubt
they've ever tried to eat

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
a full-blooded Saiyan before!

239
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,791
[GOKU] It looks like
they're about to try!

240
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:04,083
[VEGETA] Well, you must have a
sweeter scent than me, Kakarot!

241
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,791
They obviously prefer you!

242
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,333
[GOKU]
Yeah! Gee! Aren't I lucky?

243
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:15,666
[GOKU] Vegeta? Uh... Since there
are about a million of them,

244
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,583
I don't suppose you would mind
lending me a hand, now would ya?

245
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:24,083
Who, me? Of course not!
I'm a team player!

246
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,875
Hey! Seriously!
This could get ugly!

247
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,791
[GOKU grunts]

248
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,708
[VEGETA grunts]

249
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,250
[GOKU, VEGETA grunt]

250
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,416
[VEGETA grunts]

251
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,125
[VEGETA grunts]

252
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,500
[GOKU grunts]

253
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,166
Ugh! They're everywhere!

254
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:56,958
[VEGETA]
All right!

255
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,541
[VEGETA grunts]

256
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,333
[VEGETA yells]

257
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,208
What's he doing? He's going
to blow our cover!

258
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,333
That crazy--

259
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,875
[GOKU]
Ah! Little boogers!

260
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,250
[screams]

261
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,125
No, Kakarot!

262
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,708
What? What's that?

263
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,000
[screams]

264
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,333
[VEGETA]
It feels like an earthquake!

265
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:40,333
[GOKU]
Maybe he's having a, you know?

266
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,916
Huh?!

267
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,583
[VEGETA]
Look out!

268
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,416
[VEGETA]
Son of a Namek! What is it?

269
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,041
[GOKU]
I don't know!

270
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,833
[gasps]

271
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,375
[GOKU]
What in the world?!

272
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:18,041
[roars]

273
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,625
[GOKU screams]

274
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:22,958
Kakarot! It's the slime!

275
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,833
The creature is communicating
with it! Get rid of it! Quick!

276
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,958
I can't!

277
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,833
[roars]

278
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,458
[VEGETA]
Kakarot!

279
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,916
[screams]

280
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,916
[NARRATOR]
As Goku struggles to get free,

281
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,958
the jaws of death are
about to close on him!

282
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:52,791
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
