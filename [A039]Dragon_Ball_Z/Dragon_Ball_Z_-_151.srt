[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,250
Piccolo was K.O.'d by Cell

4
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,333
after bravely trying
to prevent the monster

5
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:27,291
from absorbing Androids
17 and 18 into his being.

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,791
Knowing that his friends would
have little hope against Cell

7
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,875
if his deadly
evolution was completed,

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,291
Piccolo sacrificed
everything he had

9
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:36,958
in a daring bid to stop him.

In the face of great adversity,

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,750
noble men must
often do noble deeds.

16
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,416
And so it was with
the mighty Piccolo,

17
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,916
who gave everything he had
for the Earth and its people.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But, back at
Kami's Lookout,

19
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:01,750
not being able
to help Piccolo

20
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,541
was more than Gohan could bear.

21

[GOHAN] Piccolo
needs me! Let go!

22
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,666
[GOKU] Gohan, listen!
You've got to listen to me!

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,250
I know it's not fair!

24
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,833
But we only have one
chance to beat that monster

25
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,583
and we have to play to win!

26
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,000
If we don't, Piccolo's
sacrifice will be in vain!

[NARRATOR] It's a dark day
indeed for anyone who hopes

for a peaceful life on Earth...

You would've been killed, Son.

So?! Wouldn't that be better
than just sitting around here?!

40
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:22,583
Piccolo would never turn
his back on you like this, Dad!

Your dad is hurting too, son.

Just as much as you or I.
You must know that, don't you?

44
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:40,916
[GOHAN] Then why
don't we attack?!

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,208
Isn't that better than
just wasting our time up here

46
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,500
and letting that monster
get away with it?!

Piccolo doesn't want you to die
for him. He wants you to live!

So get the training first!

Look at your dad, Gohan!

I know it's hard to believe

57
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:18,041
but I think it's even harder for
him to wait than it is for you!

58

[GOHAN] Uh, Dad,
I'm sorry about what I said.

I'm sorry that
I knocked you down.

I know how deeply
you care about Piccolo.

For some reason,
destroying Piccolo

was especially
satisfying. Indeed!

174
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,791
[ANDROID 17] It's perfectly
clear what you are,

175
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:33,208
you insect-looking freak!
Let go of me-- Ahh!

176
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:43,791
[CELL laughs]

177
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:48,708
[ANDROID 17 wails]

178
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,916
Welcome home!

179
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,708
[ANDROID 17 yells]

180
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,625
[growling]

181
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,416
[CELL laughs]

182
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,000
I won't... let you... do this!

183
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:06,791
[laughing continues]

184
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,125
[ANDROID 17] Nooo!

185
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,041
[CELL] Hmm?

186
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:28,208
[CELL] So, the big one is
more powerful than I thought!

187
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,666
Interesting...

188
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,125
Huh?

189
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,583
16! It's you!

190
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,083
I don't believe it!

191
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,208
How did you manage to
get him off of me?

192
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,541
[ANDROID 16]
I used one of my hard punches.

193
00:15:55,458 --> 00:16:00,375
I find this disturbance
to be refreshing! Oh yes!

194
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,833
Hey, thanks for the help, 16.

195
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,333
But I think you just
made him angry!

196
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,458
I am going to destroy him.

197
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,708
Sure! May I ask how?

198
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:19,750
According to my calculations,
I am just as strong as Cell.

199
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,208
Huh?!

200
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,791
[ANDROID 16]
Cell, I recommend surrender!

201
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,416
[CELL] What? To a piece
of junk like you?!

202
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,791
[CELL chuckles]

203
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,541
[ANDROID 16 yells]

204
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:05,125
Wow! The big guy's
holding his own!

205
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,333
[TIEN thinking]
Amazing!

206
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,333
This android could be the
solution to all of our problems!

207
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,583
At least I hope...

208
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:52,166
[CELL growls]

209
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,791
[ANDROID 16 yells]

210
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,625
[ANDROID 17 gasps]

211
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
[TIEN gasps]

212
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,500
[CELL laughs]

213
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:33,833
Yes, good boy! Sleep,
this won't take long!

214
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:40,250
[CELL roars]

215
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,916
Now! You die!

216
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,375
[ANDROID 16 chuckles]

217
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:52,958
[CELL] What?! Impossible!
You should be immobilized!

218
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,458
I pierced your neck! That's
where your neural link is!

219
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,291
[ANDROID 16]
Not in my design!

220
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,541
So! Dr. Gero made
some improvements!

221
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,875
[ANDROID 16] Hmmm.

222
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,833
[ANDROID 16 yells]

223
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,041
[CELL yells]

224
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,625
[ANDROID 16 yells]

225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,375
Huh?

226
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:40,000
So! You're fast, too. Well then.

227
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:42,208
This is where I cut out!

228
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,375
[ANDROID 16 grunts]

229
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,083
Now I've got you.

230
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:14,000
This little altercation has
been stimulating. Thank you.

231
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:22,083
[BOTH growling]

232
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,625
[CELL yells]

233
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,083
[CELL screams]

234
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,416
[CELL grunts]

235
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:05,333
[ANDROID 16 growls]

236
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,166
[CELL shouts]

237
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,625
[CELL screams]

238
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,500
[TIEN] Unbelievable!

239
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,541
[CELL wails]

240
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:25,166
That should put a stop to
your absorbing capabilities.

241
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,083
Now you are like a bee
without a stinger.

242
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,041
[TIEN laughs]

243
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,166
That guy did it! Awesome!

244
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:47,083
Not exactly!
Your analogy of the bee...

245
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,208
It's not quite accurate.

246
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,083
When bees lose their stingers,
they're gone for good.

247
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,041
The bee dies.

248
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:04,041
[CELL yells]

249
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,666
[CELl] But when
Cell loses his tail,

250
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,791
well, he just grows
another one!

251
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,208
Since some of Piccolo's cells
comprise my cellular structure,

252
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:21,208
I, too, have the ability
to regenerate my body!

253
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:25,000
I love the Nameks.
An amazing race.

254
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:27,333
I am the best
of every race

255
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,750
all neatly rolled
into one super being!

256
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:36,083
[CELL cackles]

257
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,291
[NARRATOR] The ominously
confident Cell continues

258
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:42,041
his bid to assimilate Androids
17 and 18 into his being.

259
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,416
Can the strong,
silent Android 16

260
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,958
rescue his comrades
from this ugly fate?

261
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,291
And what about Tien?

262
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:50,666
With all three eyes glued
to the battlefield,

263
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,833
does he have a
special plan in mind?!
