[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,875
Cell had almost
reached his final stage

3
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,708
in becoming the Ultimate
Indestructible Android.

4
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,083
And it looked like
Krillin and Android 18

5
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,041
would be no match for
his immense power.

6
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,125
You monster!

8
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,625
[NARRATOR] Android 18
has been absorbed,

9
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,708
and now it looks like Cell
has consumed the final

10
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,416
piece of the puzzle to
gain his full potential.

11
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,833
[NARRATOR] Has all
hope now vanished

12
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,291
for the people of Earth?

14
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,958

15
00:02:57,041 --> 00:03:00,041
[NARRATOR] Is there any warrior
left who is strong enough

16
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,291
to challenge the
superiority of Cell?

17
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:07,291
Or is the entire
universe doomed?

this is all my fault!

[TRUNKS] It's just like
what happened in my world!

31
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,958
All of the pain... all of
the senseless destruction!

32

[thinking] No matter
how hard I tried,

33
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,708
I was powerless to prevent it!

34
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,458
[TRUNKS] And now,
I'm afraid that this world

35
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,666
will suffer the
same fate as mine.

I've already seen
one world laid to waste

by Dr. Gero's evil creations,
and I won't let it happen again!

39

I promise you this: as long as
there is breath in my body,

40

I will fight!

[CHICHI] Master Roshi, we
have got to get out of here

49

[OOLONG] That's horrible!

51
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,375

there without anything to eat!

Are you saying Krillin didn't

use my controller
to shut down the androids?

77
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:08,291
That's right. He crushed
the controller and let her go.

00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:21,791
If I can't do this, then
Dad, Krillin, everyone!

178
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,958
I'm going to lose them all!

[GOHAN grunting]

183
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,375
So, do you still think
I'm too easy on you?

[GOHAN growling]

185
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,000
Gohan, listen!
You've got to calm down!

186
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,708
Try to focus your energy.

[GOHAN growling]

188
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,541
I'm really proud of you, Gohan.

189
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:46,958
I'm so sorry, it was so hard...

190
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,250
Hey, don't worry about it! Just
catch your breath, all right?

191
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,166
We'll take a little break...

192
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,500
Then what do you say
I give you a haircut?

193
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,666
If it gets any longer I'm
going to lose you under there!

194
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,416

207
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,291
[thinking] At last... All that I
have ever imagined is now mine!

208
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,125
I have become what no other
could ever achieve...

209

[NARRATOR] Cold this the
beginning of the end?

232
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,750
Is there no stopping
the all-powerful Cell?

233
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,500
