00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,750
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:20,000
Nappa and Vegeta continued
their conquest of the planet,

3
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:23,041
much to the terror and
dismay of Krillin and Gohan.

4
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:25,416
But Goku, having finally
returned to Earth

5
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,833
with the new skills taught
to him by King Kai,

6
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:31,541
put a sudden halt to the
Saiyans' sinister plans.

7
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,541
Thanks a lot,
Vegeta...

8
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:43,125
[NARRATOR] Not to be outdone,
Vegeta took the shame

9
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,291
of his comrade's failure
into his own hands,

10
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,041
and brought their
partnership to an end...

11
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,500
Die!

12
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,333
[NARRATOR]
Permanently.

13
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,958
[NARRATOR] Vegeta seems
confident of victory,

14
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,625
but Goku still has a
few surprises in store

15
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:12,583
for the evil Saiyan...

16
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,500
When the battle
continues... today!

17
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,583
[VEGETA] So, Kakarot,
are you ready?

18
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,208
[VEGETA chuckling]

19
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,458
[GOHAN whimpering]

20
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,791
I know a
better place!

21
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,916
Wherever!
Just lead the way!

22
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,750
[GOKU thinking]
I've got to be careful...

23
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,666
There's no telling
how powerful he is...

24
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,625
[KRILLIN]
Well, there they go.

25
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,250
[GOHAN]
Yeah...

26
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:19,250
[KRILLIN] Gohan, I, uh, I
guess we'd better get going.

27
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,625
Hey, Gohan, try
not to worry!

28
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,458
Your dad knows
what he's doing,

29
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,541
he's got everything
under control!

30
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,791
Really, I mean it!

31
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,708
Goku is the toughest
guy in the whole world!

32
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,458
Hey, plus, you
and I are a team!

33
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,333
We really did great!
Don't you think?

34
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,791
Yeah!

35
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,541
[KRILLIN] Now, let's get you
back to your mother.

36
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:51,291
I think she'll be pretty
happy to see you.

37
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,208
Yeah, no one will get hurt
if we fight way out here.

38
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,958
Kakarot...

39
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,166
I have a
proposition for you...

40
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,916
[VEGETA] I'm only going
to say this once,

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,666
so listen
carefully.

42
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,666
I, Vegeta, Prince
of all Saiyans,

43
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,666
would like to
offer you, Kakarot,

44
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,958
the opportunity to stand
beside me in this conquest.

45
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,208
With Nappa gone,
I could use a good man!

46
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,666
[VEGETA] Think about it...
We would rule the planets.

47
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,083
You could have
anything you desired.

48
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,333
There's no one in the
universe that could touch us!

49
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,875
[VEGETA] Nothing would
be out of your grasp!

50
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,625
Well, what do you
say, Kakarot?

51
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,500
I have everything that
I could ever want

52
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:08,791
right here on Earth!

53
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,583
So, I'll have to say...
no thanks.

54
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,208
Besides, I've seen how
you treat your partners.

55
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,875
Not much
job security...

56
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,000
[VEGETA chuckling]

57
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:26,875
Alright, then, so be it!
You had your chance!

58
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:03,708
[GOKU] Hyaah!

[VEGETA] Say goodbye!

64
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,375
Man, he's good! Far better
than I expected him to be...

65
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,333
I'll still
beat him!

66
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,583
Kakarot...
What's wrong?

67
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:09,583
I was hoping for a more
interesting fight!

68
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:13,291
You'll get one!
I promise!

00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,083

00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,291
Ah?!

74
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,375
Ngagh!

Haah!

Hmph!

78
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,958
[VEGETA] That Kaio-Ken
Attack is a nice trick,

79
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,708
but I've encountered something
just like it before!

80
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,500
Hah?!

81
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,291
[VEGETA chuckling]

82
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,875
Don't tell me that's
all you've got?

83
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,916
If it is,
you'd better quit!

84
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,916
[VEGETA laughing]

85
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:31,291
Heh. Funny... As grim as
things look right now,

86
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,000
I kind of like
the challenge!

00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,541

important fight...

Uh, we're
all waiting!

93
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,083
What's wrong
with it?

94
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,291
You banging it
around, that's what!

95
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,583
Alright! I've
had it with you!

Bring it on,

Wait, girls! It's
not broken! Stop it!

00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,166
I think the crystal
ball is overwhelmed.

99
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,250
Goku and Vegeta
are emitting

100
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,416
an inconceivable
amount of energy!

101
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,916
This isn't exactly
an ordinary fight!

102
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,208
So, it's started?

103
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,416
I mean Goku and that
guy are fighting?

104
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,583
Yes, I believe so.

105
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,250
I know! We can check
it out on the Scouter!

106
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,583
[ROSHI] Good thinking,
Bulma! What does it say?

107
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:40,291
Let's see... Two huge
power levels due west!

108
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,500
Only two?

109
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,416

Smiling and ready for more!

115
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,250
Who does he think he is?

116
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,458
What kind of power could
he possibly be hiding?

117
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:16,541
Guess I'll just
have to find out...

118
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,041
That's it?
That was your best?

119
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,833
I've got some bad
news for you...

120
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,875
You may be stronger than
anyone else on this planet...

00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:30,291
But even at your peak,
you're still no match for me!

00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,625
Wanna bet?

123
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,791
[VEGETA] Hah! No need
to wager... Behold!

124
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,875

Although our brave news team

fighting is still taking place,

00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:52,375
And now everything
is calm... too calm...

179
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,083
[VEGETA] Kakarot!

180
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,666
Farewell...
You're finished!

181
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,375
[GOKU shouting]

182
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,750
[VEGETA] What's the matter?
Can't find me?

183
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,958
Haah!

184
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,791
Kaio-Ken!
Times two!

185
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,416
Hraagh!

186
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,750
[VEGETA chuckling]

187
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:53,333
Well now, missed him...
How nimble!

188
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,708
[VEGETA] Nice one!

189
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,541
[thinking] What an
incredible level of power!

190
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,208
I'd better think of
something fast...

191
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,625
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up!

192
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,916
I've got
no choice...

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,416
If the Double Kaio-Ken
Attack doesn't work,

194
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,458
I guess I'll
try a triple!

195
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,625
Sorry, King Kai, but I
don't see any other way!

196
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,166
[VEGETA] What's the
matter, Kakarot?

197
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,625
You don't seem too
eager to continue!

198
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:39,250
Don't tell me you already
need to catch your breath?

199
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,791
We were just
getting started!

200
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,958
[GOKU] Don't wait on me!
Feel free to lead off anytime!

201
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
[thinking] Goku's insane!

202
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,708
This guy's beating
him senseless,

203
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,625
but he just keeps
coming back for more!

204
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:58,083
I know Goku's tough,
but it seems like this time,

205
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,416
he's finally
met his match...

206
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,708
[VEGETA] This staring contest
is beginning to irritate me.

207
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:13,625
Are you planning on continuing
our fight anytime today?

208
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,458
What's it going to be?
I'm tired of waiting!

209
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,333
[thinking] Alright, I'll try
the triple Kaio-Ken attack!

210
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,041
I sure hope my
body can take it!

211
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
[VEGETA laughing]

212
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,833
I keep forgetting that
you're an Earthling now!

213
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,958
You don't even have
a tail, do you?

214
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,958
You let them
operate on you?

215
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,666
What'd they do, get you
while you were sleeping?

216
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,541
Now I see why you have no
desire to join me on the hunt!

217
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,041
If we still had
a home planet,

218
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,958
you'd be a
laughing stock there!

219
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,375
[YAJIROBE thinking]
Oh, man!

220
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,666
It looks like Goku's
in big trouble!

221
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,541
I've got to help
him somehow...

222
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,208
And I guess the best
way for me to do that

223
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:55,750
would be to, uh... Hide!
Somewhere over this way...

224
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:04,375
[thinking] Okay, this is it!
Time to see what I'm made of.

225
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,708
[GOKU grunting]

226
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,166
Hmm?!

227
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:14,083
[GOKU growling]

228
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:20,708
Alright, here goes nothing!
Kaio-Ken Attack times three!

229
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:24,208
What? No! I told him not
to go over a double!

230
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,208
No matter what!

231
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,541
This isn't good. I don't know
if his body can handle it!

232
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:33,958
I didn't have time to
prepare him for that...

233
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:36,333
[KING KAI whimpering]

234
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,291
Oh, Goku...
Please be careful...

235
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,916
[BUBBLES chattering]

236
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:51,541
[GREGORY] C'mon, Goku!
You can do it!

237
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,833
[GOKU yelling]

238
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:05,666
Uh!

239
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,500
[CHICHI]
What's it say?

240
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,166
Wow! Look at it go!

241
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,958
Hey, let me
try it, Bulma!

242
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,500
Can it, Oolong!
This isn't a game!

243
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,125
Goku's power level
is rising rapidly!

244
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:19,041
At this rate
he'll explode!

245
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,625
[BABA] Oh, my!

246
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,791
[CHICHI] Oh, no! Goku!

247
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:27,916
Seventeen thousand... Nineteen
thousand... Over twenty-one!

248
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,625
Ahh!

249
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,625
[OOLONG] Whoa!

250
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,625
[CHICHI] Bulma,
are you okay?!

251
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,666
Yeah, I think so...

252
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,541
[OOLONG] Whoa-hoa!
Talk about overload! Man!

253
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,291
Uhh... ahh!

254
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:44,625
Huh?

255
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,666
[GOHAN whimpering]

256
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:50,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, Gohan,
what's the matter? Gohan?

257
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:53,666
[KRILLIN] 
Let's keep moving... Come on!

258
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
We gotta get to Kame House!

259
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:02,875
[thinking] Daddy, what is
that? Something's different...

260
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:12,916
[GOKU growling]

261
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,125
What? No way!

262
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,625
[GOKU growling]

263
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:33,875
Rraagh!

264
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,583
[NARRATOR] What new level
of power has Goku reached?

265
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,708
And is this new power
enough to stop

266
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,833
Vegeta's path
of destruction?

267
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,958
Goku is determined to see
this through to the end,

268
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,666
but, with the
unpredictability of Vegeta,

269
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,000
what else might be
in store for him?

270
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,291
Find out, on the next
action-packed episode

271
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:54,958
of Dragon Ball Z!
