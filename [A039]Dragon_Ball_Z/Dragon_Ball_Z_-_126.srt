00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,333
[TRUNKS] Vegeta,
Krillin, Yamcha...

2
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR] Last
time on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,416
[TRUNKS] They're all going
to lose their lives!

4
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,666
Huh?!

5
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,333
[NARRATOR]
Trunks' ominous warning

6
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,958
left Goku and his friends to
ponder a mind-bending question.

7
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,958
What could they do to alter
the course of a future

8
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,458
that had already been written?

9
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,583
[TIEN] Man, I'm going
to train, you guys!

10
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,458
[NARRATOR] And soon after Trunks
departed to face the dangers

11
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,500
that awaited him in his
own time, train they did!

12
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,416
Because with only three short
years to prepare themselves

13
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,750
for the arrival of
two deadly androids,

14
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,833
there wasn't a minute to spare!

15
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,208
Day in and day out,

16
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,375
Gohan, Goku, Piccolo,
and all of the others

17
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,791
worked harder than ever

18
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,250
to get their bodies into
the kind of shape needed

19
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,500
to take on these
powerful new enemies.

20
00:02:57,583 --> 00:03:01,208
But in the blink of an eye,
three years came and went.

21
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,625
[CHICHI] How about a little
lunch before you go?

22
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,791
Mom, we don't have
time for that!

23
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,375
Thanks. Bye!

24
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,583
[NARRATOR] The day has finally
come for Goku and his friends

25
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,333
to put their
training to the test!

26
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,958
Can they put an end to the
androids and save the world

27
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,166
from the terrible fate
that Trunks predicted?

28
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,375
It's a date with destiny,
today on Dragon Ball Z!

29
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,541
[GOKU] Slow down, Gohan!

30
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,333
We'll get there
in plenty of time!

31
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,791
You'd better save your
energy for the fight!

32
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,791
[GOHAN] Oh...
Right, Dad!

33
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,708
For three years...

34
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:59,583
Three years, we've trained
just for this moment.

35
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,000
But was it enough?

36
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,083
Why don't you ask me
again this afternoon?

37
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,625
I think we'll know by then.

38
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,750
If only we'd had
more time...

39
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,875
I feel like there's so much more
I could have done to prepare.

40
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,541
I could've gotten faster!
I could've gotten stronger!

41
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,416
Don't say that.

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
You did as much as
you could, Piccolo.

43
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,958
We all did.

44
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,791
Ha-ha!

45
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,791
Hey, Dad! Look!
I can see Krillin!

46
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,125
[GOKU] Huh?

47
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:42,583
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin!

48
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:45,625
Hey, bro!
Long time no see!

49
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:46,791
[GOHAN] Hey, Krillin!

50
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,208
[KRILLIN] Hey, Goku!

51
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,041
So buddy, think you're
about ready to tackle

52
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,958
a couple of androids today?

53
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,458
Well, I suppose
I'm as ready right now

54
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:58,333
as I'm ever going
to be, you guys.

55
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,125
I just wish things didn't
have to be this way...

56
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,125
[GOHAN]
Hey, look up ahead!

57
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,375
That must be the
island, right there!

58
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:21,125
[GOKU] Boy, there's a lot more
people here than I thought!

59
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:22,208
[KRILLIN] Yeah!

60
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,166
I didn't even know
this city existed!

61
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,875
It looks like we'll have
to divert the Androids

62
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,000
away from the city.
'Cause if we don't,

63
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:35,250
too many innocent people down
there are going to get hurt.

64
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,791
I agree.

65
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:41,750
Let's try not to get too far
ahead of ourselves you guys.

66
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,916
We have to find them first.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,083
[GOKU] Then we'd
better start looking!

68
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,916
I told you, Tien! It's him!

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,541
Hey, Goku! Down here!

70
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,000
[YAMCHA]
Hey, over here!

71
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,000
[BULMA laughs]

72
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,458
[KRILLIN] Huh...?

73
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,791
[YAMCHA] You're late!
What took you guys so long?

74
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,000
Bulma!

75
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,625
It is Bulma!

76
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:13,458
Hey, guys!

77
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,041
Wow! You all have been
working out, haven't you?

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,333
[BABY coos]

79
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,750
Bulma!

80
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:25,541
What in the world do you
think you're doing out here?!

81
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,041
[BULMA] I've come to
watch you fight, silly!

82
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,666
Oh, don't worry.

83
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,041
I'll just stay for a while
and then I'll go home.

84

Heh... I hope you don't
think I'm nuts for asking,

85
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,416
but what's the deal
with the baby, Bulma?

86
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,791
Is he your son, Yamcha?!
I'll bet he is!

87
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:46,250
Hmph. He's not MY kid!

88

Well if you think that's
a shock, just wait...

90
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,375
Wait until she tells you
who the father really is...

[GOKU laughs]

92
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,166
I'll bet it's Vegeta, isn't it?

93

Right, Trunks?

94

--Huh?!
--Uh?

95
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,750
Now, who told
you that, Goku?

96
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,916
I wanted to keep it a secret.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,041
I was going to
surprise you guys!

98
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:12,458
[GOKU laughs]

99
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,208
Well, actually I just
thought I'd take a guess!

100
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,166
I mean, he kind of
looks like Vegeta...

101
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,791
[GOKU laughs]

102
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,708
[BULMA] You guessed
his name too?

103
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,458
[GOKU] Yeah! What are
the chances of that, huh?

104
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,708
Maybe I'm psychic!

105
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,958
Outrageous...

106
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,833
Who would've guessed?
Bulma and Vegeta?!

107
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,291
[YAMCHA groans]

108
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,166
Well, since we're
on the subject,

109
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,875
where is Vegeta?

110
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,500
I don't have a clue.

111
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:42,041
I really haven't seen
him around lately.

112
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,833
I know he was
training to come here,

113
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,625
but, what, with
the baby and all,

114
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,458
well I guess I must have
lost track of him...

115
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,000
He'll show.
He wouldn't miss a fight.

116
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,208
I left Chiaotzu
at Roshi's.

117
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,708
To be honest with you,
I didn't think the little guy

118
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,208
would stand much of
a chance out here.

119
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,083
Hm.

Well, it's...
let's see...

00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,250
According to my watch it's 9:30!

123
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,958
Bulma, you better get out
of here before it's too late!

124

to be here in half an hour!

did Bulma take him?
