1
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,000
[FRIEZA] I hate to interrupt
a spirited conversation

3
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,208
such as yours,

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,833
but I'm running on a
bit of a tight schedule.

5
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:25,791
Now prepare yourself for
my final transformation!

6
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,041
[NARRATOR] The hideous
Frieza took everything

7
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,958
our heroes could dish out.

8
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,708
And retaliated by
transforming once more

9
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,916
into an even stronger form.

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,708
[FRIEZA yelling]

11
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:48,791
[yelling continues]

12
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:55,625
[yelling continues]

13
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,875
Well... now that I've
bercome a Super Saiyan.

14
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,625
It's time to let my
fists do the talking!

15
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:18,583
[NARRATOR] Vegeta and Piccolo
were restored to full strength,

16
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,625
thanks to Dende's
healing abilities.

17
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,916
But will their collective
powers be enough to stop this

18
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,500
ultimate transformation
of Frieza?

19
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:27,541
Find out... today!

20
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,333
What the...?

21
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,958
[DENDE whimpers]

22
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:14,291
Now wait just a second.
That's the new Frieza!?

23
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,416
Gotta tell ya, he doesn't
look so tough to me.

24
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,583
--I mean, he's so puny--
--[PICCOLO] Shut up!

25
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,750
Let me give you a
piece of advice kid:

26
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:24,083
Don't let that
creature fool you!

27
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,541
'Cause you know,
looks aren't everything.

28
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

29
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,916
He's just too strong!

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
And even with our
combined strength,

31
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,041
there's no way we could
start to put a dent

32
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,208
in his shiny new armor...

33
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,000
[GOHAN whimpers]

34
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,958
[PICCOLO] I say we get out.

35
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,500
And then maybe one day
we'll return... and kick--

36
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,958
What are you saying?!

37
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:51,458
[KING KAI] Nooo!

38
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,958
[BOTH] Huh?

39
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,541
[KING KAI] Oh no!

40
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:04,416
Oh my, I sense Frieza has
manifested into his final form.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,458
Drat!

42
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,208
This could mean all our hope
in Piccolo restoring your lives

43
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,666
may be for naught,

44
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,250
and the universe could fall
under Frieza's evil rule!

45
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,708
Huh?!

46
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:26,208
No. This just can't happen!
Piccolo, you must...

47
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,541
...stop Friezaaa!

48
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,416
[thinking] Frieza's power
is stronger than ever!

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,958
Ah man, I've gotta
get out of here!

50
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,833
Hm?!

51
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,291
Bang.

52
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,791
Noooo--!

53
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,458
[gasping]

54
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,083
What... happened?!

55
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:36,208
No... No!

56
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,625
[NAIL thinking] Dende?! No!
It can't be! It just can't be!

57
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,833
[PICCOLO thinking]
Frieza, you monster!

58
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:52,541
That's one down...

59
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,166
and I didn't even break a sweat.

60
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,916
[FRIEZA giggles softly]

61
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,541
No... Dende...

62
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,000
[GOHAN growls]

63
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,416
[giggling continues]

64
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,875
[growling]

65
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,458
[thinking] Oh no! This stinks!

66
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:17,875
But until I get my strength back
to 100%, I'm totally useless...

67
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,958
Dende? Dende!
Say something, Dende!

68
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,083
He... He saw Dende's power to
heal us and that's the reason

69
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,625
he decided to
take him out first.

70
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,791
[GOHAN growls]

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,708
Hey! He disappeared!

72
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,375
[thinking] Come back
and fight like a man.

73
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:10,083
Wait. What's that?

74
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,041
[FRIEZA] Hello, boys.

75
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,041
How dare you!

76
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,041
[FRIEZA] Now...

77
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,333
...it's time to pull
back the curtain

78
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,625
and let the third
and final act begin.

79
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,666
[GOHAN growls]

80
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,041
My, my, you're quite upset
about what I did

81
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,583
to your little
friend over there.

82
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,041
How touching...

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,833
Oh well, what's done is done.

84
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:45,250
[GOHAN growls]

85
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,000
You seem especially anxious
to get things started.

86
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,375
Shall we begin?

87
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,083
[GOHAN yells]

88
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:55,750
[GOHAN shouts]

89
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,333
I've had all I
can take from you!

90
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:10,791
Hmph.

91
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,791
[growling]

92
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,083
[ALL yell]

93
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:28,875
[grunting]

94
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:35,416
[grunting continues]

95
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:47,666
[grunting continues]

96
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,333
[PICCOLO] Masenko-Haaaa!

97
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,250
Right! That does it!

98
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:15,583
Kamehame-Haaaa!

99
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,875
Hyaaaa!

100
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,041
Did you get him?!

101
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,083
[KRILLIN] I-I'm not sure...

102
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:46,333
Yeah. I don't see him anywhere.

103
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,041
[VEGETA] You idiots! Behind you!

104
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,875
What!?

105
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,250
Here I am.

106
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,541
[VEGETA] Look out!

107
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,833
[GOHAN grunts]

108
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,666
[KRILLIN screams]

109
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,541
[PICCOLO growls]

110
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,583
[GOHAN screams]

111
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,666
But I-I didn't see
him move a muscle.

112
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:00,750
How does he move so fast? It's
like his moves are invisible...

113
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,333
[PICCOLO growls

114
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:05,833
[thinking] But somehow Vegeta
could see them! I wonder how?

115
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,833
Did Dende give him some
sort of special power?

116
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,000
[GOHAN] Thanks, Vegeta!

117
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,416
You saved us!

118
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,916
[GOHAN laughs]

119
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,166
I didn't save you.
You're not even worth it.

120
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,250
Huh?

121
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,833
[VEGETA chuckles]

122
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,291
I suppose you guys weren't
quite aware of my new powers! 

123
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,333
What? New powers?

124
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,791
Huh?

125
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,416
So, what are you saying?

126
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,125
You think you can
take him on yourself?

127
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,083
Oh yes.

128
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,541
He-He's crazy!

129
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,958
[VEGETA] Why don't you
run back to your mommies,

130
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,750
I've got a little
business to take care of.

131
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,333
Your words may be tough, Vegeta,

132
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,583
but I wonder if you
can truly back them up?

133
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:18,125
I don't think you realize just
who you're dealing with.

134
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,666
So let me show you!

135
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,166
Introducing...

136
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,250
...for the very first time...

137
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,208
Super Saiyan Vegeta!

138
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,166
S-Super...

139
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,541
...S-Sai... Him...?

140
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,458
[thinking] Vegeta?
A Super Saiyan?

141
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,375
What's he talking about?

142
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,416
At last the power
is all mine, Frieza!

143
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,750
[VEGETA laughs]

144
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:49,958
[FRIEZA giggles]

145
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,708
Forgive me if I don't tremble
in fear, "Super Saiyan".

146
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,125
[FRIEZA giggles]

147
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,791
You don't believe me, do you?

148
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,666
Then I'll just wipe that grin
off your face, Frieza.

149
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you ready to fight?

150
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:12,083
[FRIEZA growls]

151
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:22,208
[growling continues]

152
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,916
[thinking]
What's going on out there?

153
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,666
Now I sense Vegeta's
power building!

154
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:37,041
[VEGETA growls]

155
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,666
[VEGETA yells]

156
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,125
Wh-What's happening?!

157
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:58,458
[thinking] B-But where did
Vegeta get all this power from?!

158
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,583
[PICCOLO thinking]
He just stood by and watched

159
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,333
as I was fighting Frieza...

160
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,541
Did he have that type
of strength then?

161
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,500
[VEGETA growls]

162
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,041
[PICCOLO thinking] How
did this happen? How?!

163
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,208
[KRILLIN] Don't you get it?!

164
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,208
Vegeta told me that a Saiyan's
strength is at its peak

165
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,750
right after he recovers
from a mortal wound!

166
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,208
What?!

167
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:47,666
[VEGETA roars]

168
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,500
[GOHAN whimpers]

169
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:56,083
Gohan! I think we better get
outta here while we still can!

170
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,041
So you're saying it's
possible for Vegeta

171
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,125
to go from all-talk
to super-tough

172
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,625
in the wink of an eye?

173
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,041
Do you remember when Vegeta
asked me to beat him up?!

174
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,458
Well that allowed Dende to heal
him and give him his new powers!

175
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:12,666
Ah... Now I think I understand.

176
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,541
[VEGETA growls]

177
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,250
Look at Vegeta! Man,
he's really turning it on!

178
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,666
I've got a feeling Frieza's
going down this time!

179
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,333
What do you think,
Gohan?! Oh yeah!

180
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,291
[KRILLIN laughs]

181
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:08,250
[VEGETA growls]

182
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:12,083
[VEGETA roars]

183
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:20,333
[grunting]

184
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:26,875
[VEGETA roaring]

185
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,583
[GOHAN] Wha-What
happened, Krillin?

186
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,791
Oh no! That's not good!
Frieza's still standing!

187
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,416
Hold on, Gohan, there's
more fireworks to come.

188
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,958
I've got a feeling
we haven't seen

189
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,458
the full extent of
Vegeta's powers yet!

190
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,458
[GOHAN] You think so?

191
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:24,375
Yeah! I think you got that
right! I mean, just look at him!

192
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,208
Yep. It's like I said before,
Vegeta just might win

193
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,208
this battle for us after all!

194
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,416
Well, well, you
certainly surprise me

195
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,250
with your new found force.

196
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,458
And I'm just warming
up, you clown!

197
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,333
What you just witnessed was
only the beginning of my power!

198
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,500
If you had one of your
stupid scouters here

199
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,500
you'd realize
my true potential

200
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,083
and you'd run like the
coward you really are!

201
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,458
No matter. A Saiyan
loves a good fight,

202
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,083
and you'll discover
my powers soon enough.

203
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,875
So, let's stop talking
and cut to the chase!

204
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:08,166
This time you're going down!

205
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,625
Wha'sa matter? Is your brain
another one of your weak

206
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,750
and underused muscles?

207
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,333
Very well. You've
had your fun.

208
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,541
But I really do feel
sorry for you now.

209
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,458
Because now you have to
back up your delusional,

210
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,125
pathetic taunts, Super Saiyan.

211
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,125
[VEGETA growls]

212
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,291
Shut up!

213
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,750
[VEGETA growls]

214
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,875
[VEGETA grunts]

215
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,291
[VEGETA yells]

216
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,833
You're making me mad!

217
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,291
[VEGETA growls]

218
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:05,375
[VEGETA grunting]

219
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:06,375
[KRILLIN gasps]

220
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,791
[KRILLIN] He's winning!

221
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,833
Look, Vegeta's got him
on the ropes now, Gohan!

222
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:11,958
Hmm!

223
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,875
[PICCOLO] No!

224
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,916
Huh?

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,083
He... He won't win!
He... He can't!

226
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,333
Wh-What are you saying?

227
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,708
[VEGETA grunting]

228
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,166
[VEGETA chuckles]

229
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,875
[FRIEZA] Quit fooling yourself.
You're no match for my speed.

230
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,833
[VEGETA yells]

231
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,916
This is impossible! There's no--
There's no sign of him anywhere!

232
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:57,625
[FRIEZA giggles softly]

233
00:21:57,708 --> 00:22:00,208
No! No! NO!

234
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:01,625
[giggling continues]

235
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,250
Well, it looks like you're not
that "Super" of a Saiyan

236
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,625
after all, huh?

237
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,458
[FRIEZA giggles]

238
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:11,750
In fact, I guess this
makes you the loser.

239
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:16,666
What does this mean?

240
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,291
It-It means Piccolo was right

241
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:21,833
and V-Vegeta doesn't stand
a chance against Frieza!

242
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:25,375
No one stands a chance
against Frieza...

243
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:28,541
Ah... Da-Daddy...

244
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:37,291
[thinking] I have to get out of
here! Must help... Gohan!

245
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:40,291
[NARRATOR] Is Vegeta
truly a "Super Saiyan"

246
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,458
or will this be his
"Sayonara Battle"

247
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,958
against the superior speed
and strength of Frieza?

248
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:50,916
Find out in the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
