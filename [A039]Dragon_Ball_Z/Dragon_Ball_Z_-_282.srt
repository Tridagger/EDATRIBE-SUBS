00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,041
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,000
it was Majin verses
Saiyan, as the battle

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,125
that would decide the fate
of the Universe raged on.

4
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,333
[NARRATOR]
It was a trial of pain for Goku,

5
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,750
but the darker it got,
the brighter his light shined.

6
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:34,041
And in classic style,
he countered Buu's every attack.

7
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,250
[NARRATOR]
But as the battle wore on,

8
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,500
Goku felt the power needed to
destroy Buu slipping away.

9
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,333
[GOKU growls]
I should have done it.

10
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,666
Darn it, now I'm weak.
I'll need time.

11
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,791
I havee got it covered,
Kakarot. Sixty seconds.

12
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,500
Get what you need,
and finish him off.

13
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,750
[NARRATOR]
One minute.

14
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,958
That's how long Vegeta
had to keep Buu occupied

15
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,000
so Goku could gather the
energy needed to destroy him.

16
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,208
But in this fight, one minute
can seem an eternity.

17
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:11,416
Has the Saiyan Prince
reached the end of his rope?

18
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Stay tuned to find out.

19
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,416
[gasps]

20
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,416
What's going on?

21
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,250
I should have been able
to gather all the energy

22
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,708
I need by now.

23
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,125

--[VEGETA groans]

38
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,750
[OLD KIA] I know it's
difficult to watch, son,

39
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,500
but you can't leave now.

40
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,666
[KABITO KAI] It's not that, Sir.
I've decided to go home.

41
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,750
What? Are you crazy?

42
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,791
I know Buu's strength is
vastly superior to my own,

43
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,875
that fact has been proven
on more than one occasion,

44
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:55,333
but I think I can at
least stand up to him

45
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:58,375
long enough to give
Goku a little extra time.

46
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,833
I can't stand by and watch again
like I did all those years ago,

47
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,458
when Majin Buu first
attacked my fellow Kais.

48
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,666
Even if I can only
buy one extra second,

49
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,000
it'll be worth it.

50
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,208
[OLD KAI]
Wait a minute.

51
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,166
[DENDE]
Yeah, wait. I'm coming, too.

52
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,791
Uh? You, too?

53
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:17,875
I'm no fighter,

54
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,708
but if I can manage
to stay alive,

55
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,250
my healing powers
might come in handy.

56
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:28,750
Are you sure?

57
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,791
[DENDE]
Yes, sir. I'm positive.

58
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:36,375
I'm willing to take the chance
if it means helping Goku. Hm.

59
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,666
Outstanding.

60
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,083
Well, shall we go?

61
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,125
Right.

62
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,875
Hold it! Hold it!

63
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:45,541
--[OLD KAI panting]
--[DENDE, KABITO KAI] Hm?

64
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:49,666
[OLD KAI panting]
Just a second. Not so fast.

65
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,291
Look, I know you both
want to help,

66
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,000
and I very much
admire your courage,

67
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,250
but if you show up now
that's just two more people

68
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,750
Goku has to worry about.

69
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,000
Please, don't go yet.

70
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,875
I know how you must feel,

71
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,125
but we have to trust
in Goku's judgment.

72
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:14,791
Let's be patient, and let
him and Vegeta handle this.

73
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:17,375
I still believe those two
know what they're doing.

74
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,000
It's hard to watch them suffer,

75
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:23,041
but you have to realize that
this is what they live for.

76
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:25,625

Kakarot, go, it's my fault
I'm in this pitiful state now,

89
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,791
not yours.

90
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,541

Not good.

If Vegeta gets hit by an energy
blast of that magnitude,

97

he's a goner.

Caught you with your filthy
hand in the cookie jar,

105
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,333
didn't I, big guy?

106
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
How long did you think
you could get away

107
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,750
with these injustices?

108
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,500
Mr. Satan will step in
if that other coward won't.

You know the real
battle's about to begin.

way with those other two,

against the World Champion!

Kiss my blarney stone.

119
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:48,000
[MR. SATAN] What's the matter?
Is Buu scared of the Champ?

I was only kidding before,

132
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,541
when I said that stuff about
you being scared of me.

133
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,083
Really, I didn't mean any of it!

down to an art form.

Yoo-hoo. Too much speed, huh?

155
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,583
[GOKU thinking]
This is bizarre.

156
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,416
He has Buu completely subdued,

157
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,500
but he doesn't seem
to be doing anything.

Kakarot.

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,416
What are you doing?

160
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,041
Idiot. You should use
this time to power up.

161
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,500
Aw, man. You're right.

162
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,833

00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

167
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,083
[OLD KAI]
My word.

168
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,708
Double Buu's?!

169
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,708
[OLD KAI] Can either of you
tell me what's going on?

170
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,291
Well, sort of.

171
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,500
I know the original Majin Buu
was friends with Mister Satan,

172
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,750
until he split and was absorbed
by the newer, evil form.

173
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:12,166
He must've still been
inside evil Buu's body,

174
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,083
and he kept him
from harming Mr. Satan.

175
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,416
So the evil Buu
spit the good Buu out

176
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,708
like a piece of
used-up chewing gum.

177

really matter at this point.

a few serious character flaws,

he's the last human alive.
