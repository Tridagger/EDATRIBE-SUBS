00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] On the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:18,250
Majin Buu was on a manhunt
for Goku and Vegeta,

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,958
and when his search led him
to the great Kai Planet,

4
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,750
life in Other World took
a turn for the worse.

5
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,458
[KRILLIN grunts]

6
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,000
[grunts]

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,125
[NARRATOR] Vegeta wanted to
lure Buu away from the planet

8
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:34,875
before he destroyed it,
but Goku wasn't sure how.

9
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,166
[VEGETA]
Oh, use your brain, Kakarot.

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,708
All we have to do is
raise our power levels,

11
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:42,000
and he'll come running.

12
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:44,333
Of course!

13
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:45,250
Right!

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,375
Buu squash you like bugs!

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:52,166
[NARRATOR] Hearing their call,
Buu didn't waste a moment,

16
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,291
but went directly to the sacred
land of the Supreme Kai,

17
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,166
where the battle is
about to begin!

18
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:18,041
[laughs]

19
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,250
[ALL gasp]

20
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:41,333
[chuckles] How perfect!
We can fight as we like here.

21
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,250
[GOKU]
Hm.

22
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,541
Please leave now, you guys.

23
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,541
If you try to stay, you'll
only be helping Majin Buu.

24
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,958
[KIBITO KAI]
What?

25
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,250
[GOKU] Sorry, but we can't fight
to our full potential

26
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,208
if we're worried
about your safety.

27
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,791
Oh yeah, I understand now.

28
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,166
I know what's going on here!

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,583
Sure, you're thinking
that our sacred planet

30
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,250
is going to be demolished
during the fight.

31
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,416
Oh well, kick some
butt, you two.

32
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,750
Thanks, Old Kai.

33
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,875
Do your best, Vegeta,
and you, too, Goku!

34
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,625
[VEGETA chuckles]

35
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,875
[DENDE thinking]
Goku...

36
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
Grab a hold of me, you two.

37
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,250
I believe it's time
for us to go.

38
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,166
[OLD KAI]
I don't know about this!

39
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,416
You'll be just fine.

40
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,458
[screams]

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,416
Where are we?

42
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,041
I've transported us to a
planet in the physical plane,

43
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,541
quite far from the action
is taking place.

44
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,041
We'll be safe here.

45
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,125
[OLD KAI] You could've picked
a place with shorter grass.

46
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,708
Oh well, too late!

47
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,083
Those Saiyans
are a stubborn lot!

48
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,333
Why did they have to destroy
those earrings we gave them?

49
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,375
I guess they plan on using the
Fusion Technique to fight Buu.

50
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,458
But can they get the
job done in half an hour?

51
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:15,416
Well... I doubt it, but at
least they'll have a chance.

52
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,833
Hey, we should
probably decide now,

53
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,000
while we still have
a spare minute.

54
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:25,375
[VEGETA] Right! How are
we going to do it?

55
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:29,333
[GOKU] I guess we'll try
the old fashioned way.

56
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:32,916
[VEGETA] All right, Kakarot,
you're asking for it.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,750
[GOKU]
We'll see about that!

58
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,208
[GOKU, VEGETA]
Rock! Paper!

59
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,291
[gasping]

60
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:44,166
[VEGETA, GOKU] Ready!
Rock! Paper! Scissors! Haa!

61
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,291
Yeah! I did it!

62
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,583
[groans]

63
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
That's not the Fusion Technique!

64
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:53,333
Those idiots! What in the
world are they doing?!

65
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,958
Have they finally gone mad?

66
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,666
[VEGETA]
Yeah, you beat me, Kakarot,

67
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,208
but there's a good chance
that I'll get my turn anyway!

68
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,666
Gee, thanks,

69
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,708
but if you wanted a turn,
you should have chose paper!

70
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,791
[GOKU]
The fact of the matter is,

71
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,125
I probably could have
destroyed the fat Majin Buu

72
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,416
when I was at
Super Saiyan Three,

73
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,833
but I wanted Gohan and
the boys to try their hand

74
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,500
at saving the world.

75
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,666
I won't be around forever.

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,208
And, neither will he, hopefully.

77
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:30,291
All right, Buu! Let's do it!

78
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,541
What's the deal?
Did he drop something?

79
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,375
Huh?!

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:45,916

[GOKU] That bum, he's sound
asleep! How dare he!

83
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,833
No, this can't go on anymore!

84
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:08,333
He's killed too many innocent
people. It's not right!

85

86
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,833

Ahh! Oh, no! What have we done?

91

that other man and his dog

92

with us when we left!

Good, where are they, King Kai?

108
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,125
[KING KAI]
The planet you're seeing

109
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,833
is the sacred land of the Kais,
the abode of Supreme Kai.

110
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,166
Even us lower Kais

111
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,000
have a difficult
time reaching that place!

112
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:07,125
I doubt Buu would have ever
found that planet on his own.

113
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,000
They must have lured him there.

114
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,750
Probably to prevent
him from destroying us.

115
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,916
[YAMCHA] With Goku there,
it wouldn't surprise me.

116

Hey! What is all this nonsense

117
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,625
that you're babbling
about, Northy?

178
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,333
[KING KAI]
Mm-hm.

179
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,875
We're lucky to
be alive right now.

180
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
No offense, Pikkon,
but he's a lot stronger.

181
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:58,750
[PIKKON grunts]

182
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,833
[WEST KAI]
It's true!

183
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:19,875
Okay, on to Plan B,
whatever that is.

184
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,125
--[GOKU grunts]
--[KID BUU] Ah!

185
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,625
[MR. SATAN, BEE whimpering]

186
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,250
I hope they're having fun,
because I'm not!

187
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,458
[whimpers]

188
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,708
Ancestor, you're shaking
like a leaf. What's wrong?

189
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:32,958
[laughs]

190
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,375
[growls]

191
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:49,083
Great! Now what's he up to?
Better not wait to find out!

192
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,250
[GOKU yells]

193
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,208
[gasps]

194
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,833
[KID BUU yells]

195
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,291
[gasps]

196
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:15,916
Ah! [groaning]

197
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,958
[yells]

198
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:34,458
[growls]

199
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,291
[GOKU]
Uh-oh!

200
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,666
[chuckles]

201
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,666
[whimpers]

202
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,666
[VEGETA]
Where are you, Kakarot?

203
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,083
[VEGETA]
Freaky.

204
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,708
[KID BUU chuckles] 

205
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,958
[gasps]

206
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,583
[KID BUU laughs]

207
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:04,041
--[MR. SATAN groaning]
--[BEE whimpering]

208
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:24,750
[laughing]

209
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,083
[laughs]

210
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,666
It's all over!

211
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,750
Majin Buu is too strong!

212
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,333
I don't wanna see
Goku get hurt!

213
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,541
[OLD KAI] Now, now,
I wouldn't count Goku out yet!

214
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:57,000
You can still see
fire in his face, look!

215
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,166
[KABITO KAI, DENDE gasp]

216
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,375
That's not the look
of a desperate man.

217
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:04,541
That's the face
of a true champion!

218
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,041
[whimpers]

219
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,958
Is it over? The dream!
Tell me it's over, boy!

220
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,791
[screams]

221
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:18,125
[MR. SATAN] Someone wake me up!
I can't take it anymore!

222
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,708
Darn you!
Where's your weak point?

223
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,916
You're twice as strong
as you were before!

224
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,208
Your speed, your power.

225
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:33,208
[laughs]

226
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,458
There, you see? I told you,
he's pulling out the stops.

227
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:09,333
[yells]

228
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:27,500
Heh. So Kakarot's finally
in the mood, is he?

229
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,375
[VEGETA thinking] This ought
to be one to remember.

230
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,333
[GOKU]
Majin Buu, your time has come!

231
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:36,458
[gasps, chuckles]

232
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,791
[NARRATOR] The battle that will
decide the fate of the Universe

233
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,500
is about to begin in earnest!

234
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,875
Can Super Saiyan Three Goku
topple the infamous Majin Buu?

235
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,625
Next time, on Dragon Ball Z!
