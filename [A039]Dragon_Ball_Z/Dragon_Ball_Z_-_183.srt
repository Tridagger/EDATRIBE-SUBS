00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,250
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,000
the match between Cell
and Gohan opened with a bang,

3
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,833
as Cell released a
merciless assault

4
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:23,208
on the 11 year-old powerhouse.

5
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,125
[CELL yells]

6
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,333
[NARRATOR] And on-lookers
began to question if

7
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,208
Goku's confidence in 
his son was well deserved

8
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,166
as the young boy
refused to fight back.

9
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,291
[PICCOLO] Goku, you fool!

10
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,791
We told you this
would happen. We told you!

11
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,791
But you just
wouldn't listen to us!

12
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,875
Not so fast, Piccolo!

13
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,833
Can't you sense
his energy? He's fine.

14
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,958
Huh?!

15
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,416
[NARRATOR] With an
explosive re-entrance,

16
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,083
Gohan showed that he'd
endured the android's attack

17
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,250
with only minor
scrapes and bruises.

18
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:03,666
Clearly, Gohan had the
potential to defeat Cell.

19
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,833
But the boy
did not want to fight,

20
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:08,916
afraid of what
his own powers would do.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,750
[GOHAN] I've gotten
much stronger,

22
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,375
and if I were to lose control,

23
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,250
there's really no telling
how powerful I might become.

24
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,250
And there's no telling
what kind of damage

25
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,125
a power like that might cause.

26
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,083
Well, your story didn't work,

27
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,041
but you have given me
something to work for.

28
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,250
You see, Gohan...

29
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,791
this "hidden power"
of yours intrigues me,

30
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,875
and now that I know about it,

31
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm determined
to see it for myself!

32
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:39,625
[GOHAN gasps]

33
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,083
[grunting]

34
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,958
[NARRATOR] Cell is
thirsty for a fight,

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:45,208
and his
curiosity is aroused.

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,083
Now that he knows
about Gohan's power,

37
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:50,791
Cell will not stop until
this hidden beast is uncaged.

38
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,916
[NARRATOR] Playing with Gohan
is like playing with dynamite.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,333
But detonation is
exactly what Cell wants.

40
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
Just how far will he go?

41
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,791
What vicious
tactics will he employ

42
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,791
to light the Saiyan's fuse?

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,125
Well then. It looks like I might
actually get through to you yet!

44
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,208
[thinking] You can do this,
Gohan, I know you can.

45
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,166
Show everyone what an
incredible fighter you are!

46
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:03,375
What's happening down
there, Hercule?! Is it bad?

47
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:09,083
Of course it's bad! This is
no place for a child to be!

48
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,125
Unless a hero is found to
put down this terrible monster,

49
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:16,708
everyone on the
Earth will be massacred!

50
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:18,791
Must we all put our futures

51
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,166
in the hands of one fragile,
helpless little boy?

52
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,125
This reporter hopes not!

53
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,625
Mr. Satan, how's your stomach?

54
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,000
Ohh...

[MR. SATAN groans]

56
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,750
[MR. SATAN] Why'd you
make me think about it?!

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,875
--Oh, the pain!
--Well, there you have it,

58
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,583
the champ is still crippled
by a most lethal stomach virus!

59
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:43,333
We must be cursed for this
to happen to our greatest guy!

60
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,375

give your engine a jump start!

Frieza's finishing moves!

And I'm sure
if we don't get help,

us all like this!

Goku, you can keep
standing there all you want,

92
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,791
but I'm helping Gohan!

93
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
No, you're not!

94
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,166
You and I both know you're
not strong enough to fight Cell!

95
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,375
So wait. Just
a little bit longer!

96
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,208
For what?
For Gohan to get killed?!

97
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,166
For Cell to rip him
to pieces while we watch?!

98
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,166
Wait until he has no choice.

99
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,291
[PICCOLO] Huh?

100
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,791
And then...

101
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,583
Right when Gohan is backed
into a corner with no way out,

102
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,333
he'll awaken his
furious inner strength.

103

[KRILLIN] Huh?

104
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,541
And when that happens,
you watch.

105

down once and for all!

[PICCOLO] Enough
of this game, Goku!

112

You're wrong about your son!

113
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,500
Gohan may have that power,
but it doesn't matter!

114
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,000
He doesn't thirst
for battle and mayhem!

115
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,916
He's not a fighter like you!

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,375
Huh?!

117
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you want to know
what he's thinking?!

118
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,666
He's not thinking about
strength, or about competition!

119
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,791
He's wondering why his father is
standing there letting him die!

120
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,541
And so your son may be
the most powerful person

in the world, but he's also
a scared 11 year-old boy!
