00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,333
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:17,916
Ginyu Force members
Burtur and Jeice

3
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,916
launched a tag-team
assault on Goku!

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,541
Together, they fired they fired
the Purple Spiral Flash attack.

5
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,541
But, to their surprise,
it was a move easily defended

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,791
by our newly arrived hero!

7
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,416
Ah! What's happening?!

8
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
[growling]

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,750
[NARRATOR] As the smoke cleared,
Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin

10
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:45,875
watched in awe as Jeice prepared
to fire a second attack!

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,250
Crusher...

12
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:55,458
Ball!

13
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,625
[NARRATOR] But this too was
deflected with little effort.

14
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:03,250
Goku looks unstoppable, which is
bad news for Burtur and Jeice!

15
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,708
Do two of the strongest warriors
of Frieza's fighting force

16
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,791
even stand a chance against
the Saiyan's new power?

17
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,166
Find out... today!

18
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,041
Darn it!
Where did he go?!

19
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,083
[BURTUR grunting angrily]

20
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,666
Burtur! Behind!

21
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,333
[BURTUR screams

22
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,666
Hey.

23
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,166
How... how the heck
did you do that?!

24
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,708
I mean...

25
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,625
How did you get behind me?!

26
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,791
No one's that fast!

27
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,875
[GOKU] Well, apparently I am.

28
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,000
[BURTUR growling]

29
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,958
[thinking] Man, I've
never seen anyone

30
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,875
get to Burtur like this before!

31
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,375
And he deflected my Fire Crusher
Ball like it was a beach ball!

32
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,250
This isn't good!
I don't like it one bit!

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,250
[BURTUR growls]

34
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,291
Who are you?!

35
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,416
My name is Goku
and I'm a Saiyan...

36
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,333
from Earth.

37
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,166
[BURTUR growling]

38
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,500
Liar!

39
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,416
I've defeated hundreds of
Saiyans and none of them

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,708
were faster than me!

41
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:24,416
[GOKU]
It must be my diet.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,583
I eat really wholesome foods.

43
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,291
Your diet?
Your diet, huh?!

44
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:32,083
Well, you're about to make
my fist part of your diet!

45
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,625
Oh, I see. Playing
it cool, are you?

46
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,750
Well, you'll die even faster!

47
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,791
[BURTUR yellling,
GOKU grunting]

48
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,000
Why don't you stay still
and fight me like a man?!

49
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:50,708
[BURTUR and GOKU grunting]

50
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,541
Can... you see?

51
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,000
No way!

52
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,250
[VEGETA softly growls]

53
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,750
Hyaah!

54
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,500
That does it!
I've had enough!

55
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:13,208
No one makes a fool
of the Ginyu Force!

56
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,416
[JEICE yells]

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,291
[ALL grunting]

58
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,250
[BURTUR]
Outta my way!

59
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:25,875
[grunting continues]

60
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,875
[BURTUR] He can't dodge
us forever, Jeice!

61
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,708
He's gotta screw
up sometime!

62
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,458
[JEICE] Right!

63
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,875
[grunting continues]

64
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:34,625
[blows landing]

65
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,083
[JEICE] Gwaahh...

66
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:40,250
Idiot!

67
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,791
It's your fault,
ya dope!

68
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:47,458
[BOTH growling]

69
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
[JEICE] Wait, Burtur!

70
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,625
He's doing this to us, mate!
Don't you get it?!

71
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,875
He is...?

72
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,791
[JEICE] Darn right, he is!

73
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,375
[GOKU]
Hey, guys! Yo!

74
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,208
[GOKU] Well, do you want
to dance, or fight?!

75
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,500
[BOTH growling]

76
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,750
[BOTH yelling]

77
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,208
[GOKU]
Woah!

78
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,333
[BURTUR gasps]

79
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,166
[GOKU]
Hyaah!

80
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,333
[BURTUR screams]

81
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,250
[JEICE yelling]

82
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:15,083
[GOKU grunts]

83
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:21,208
[BURTUR yelling]

84
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,375
[blow landing]

85
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:30,000
[BURTUR groaning]

86

[groaning continues]

88
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,500
[GOKU yells]

89
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,458
[GOKU] You've been
deceiving yourselves!

90
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,000
This fight is fruitless!

91
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,833
[JEICE whimpering]

92
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,166
[GOKU] Listen!

93
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,708
It's not too late for
you to leave this planet!

94
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,708
Your choice. But if I were you,
I'd get out of here!

95
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,500
[VEGETA] Don't be a fool,
Kakarot!

96
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,416
He's destroyed more
men than you can count!

97
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,000
[GOKU] Don't you
remember, Vegeta?

98
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,833
We let you go on Earth!

99
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,583
Don't you think they
deserve the same chance?

100
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,291
[VEGETA growls]

101
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,958
Man o' man!

102
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,458
Burtur!
This is totally insane!

103
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:19,708
I don't know who this guy is,
or where he came from,

104
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,958
but he's good!

105
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,916
Geez, I've never
seen anything like it!

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,375
We never even
touched him!

107
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,291
Now, that's
one bad dude!

108
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,375
[JEICE growls]

109
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:34,166
I'm bad! But man,
I ain't that bad!

110
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,208
Sometimes you've got
to know when to go, go, go!

111
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,291
[GOHAN]
Hey, he's running away!

112
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,291
Gosh, he's some
friend, isn't he?

113
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,416
These guys might walk
funny for a while,

114
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,791
but they'll recover just fine!

115
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,916
[RECOOME moaning]

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,541
[BURTUR groaning]

117
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,041
[GOKU] Strong fighters,
but with weak characters!

118
00:07:55,125 --> 00:08:02,208
[KRILLIN] Uhhh... Hey, uh,
you are Goku, aren't you...?

119
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,500
What? Of course
I am, Krillin!

120
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't be silly!

121
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,166
[VEGETA growling]

122
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,791
[GOKU] Hm?!

123
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,041
[VEGETA yells,
BURTUR screams]

124
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,500
Hey, stop!

125
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:17,708
[GOKU] Vegeta, that's enough!
What are you doing?!

126
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,166
[VEGETA]
Rrrgh!

127
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,875
[GOHAN gasps, whimpers]

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,375
What's your deal?!

129
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,333
You know how to receive
mercy but you can't give it!

130
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,208
Too bad! I was hoping
you might have changed!

131
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,875
They don't deserve
any favors!

132
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,416
They're scum, Kakarot!
Believe me!

133
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,416
Would they have taken mercy
on your son and your friend?!

134
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,083
If you'd arrived
ten minutes later,

135
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,875
they'd be gone right now!

136
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,333
[KRILLIN whimpers]

137
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,333
You're too soft
to be a Saiyan!

138
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,708
That freak you let go
could cost you your life!

139
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,291
No way, not him!

140
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:10,083
[VEGETA] He doesn't have to be
stronger than you to beat you!

141
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,125
He could take your kid
hostage and make you walk

142
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,041
right into their
hands like a lamb!

143
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,791
These people are ruthless
savages, Kakarot!

144
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
They're warriors!

145
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:21,125
And they'll do whatever
it takes to win the game!

146
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,000
And here you are,
Mr. Nice Guy!

147
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,875
They're going to chew you up and
spit you out with that attitude!

148
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,458
[GOKU] We'll see...
I don't think having

149
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,833
a little compassion
is a disadvantage.

150
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,583
You poor fool.

151
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,291
A fight with Frieza
is a fight to the end!

152
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,291
And it will be your end!

153
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,916
Your nothing compared
to Frieza, Kakarot!

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,583
[KRILLIN] Uh, excuse me,
I hate to interrupt,

155
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,750
but, who's going
to beat who here?

156
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,625
You saw how Goku handled
those guys earlier!

157
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,583
[GOHAN chuckles]

158
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:49,791
He was in a league
of his own!

159
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,458
They couldn't even touch him!

160
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,958
And this guy's
supposed to beat him?!

161
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,208
Not likely!

162
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,458
[GOHAN] Yeah!

163
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,875
Kakarot's strong, but
he's not strong enough!

164
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,666
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN groan]

165
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,833
[VEGETA] And besides!

166
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:02,541
Frieza's been after
the Dragon Balls!

167
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:06,333
And if I know him, he's probably
already made his wish by now!

168
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:09,541
Which means you won't be dealing
with an all-powerful maniac!

169
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,875
You'll be dealing
with an immortal!

170
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,208
[KRILLIN] Hm!

171
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,208
[GOHAN] Huh?

172
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,583
No, I don't think
that Frieza guy

173
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,666
has used the
Dragon Balls yet.

174
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,750
[VEGETA] Huh?
Why not?! Explain!

175
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,458
Well, on Earth, when
you summon call the Dragon,

176
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,083
all kinds of crazy
stuff starts happening!

177
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,333
For one thing, the
entire sky turns pitch black!

178
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,583
[KRILLIN] Plus, there's
always a lot of lightning.

179
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,833
Radical lightning!
And high winds!

180
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,875
Nope, the sky's
been real calm.

181
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,083
[VEGETA] What! Then Frieza
hasn't summoned the Dragon yet!

182
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,416
But why not?!

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,625
He's bound to have had
them all for a while now!

184
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,250
Hey, I think I know why!

185
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:54,458
I'll bet Frieza doesn't
know the password, huh?

186
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,500
These balls aren't
like the ones on Earth.

187
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,500
Here you need to
know a password!

188
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,166
A password?!

189
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,416
Then there's still hope!

190
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,166
[GOKU] Hey, that means there's
still a chance to wish Piccolo

191
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,125
and the others back
to this dimension!

192
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,500
Alright!

193
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,458
[GOKU]
Whatd'ya say, Gohan?!

194
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,041
[GOHAN chuckles]

195
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
[GOKU] You guys
should be proud!

196
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,375
This means all of your hard
work might still pay off!

197
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,500
[GOHAN]
Woo-hooo!

198
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,041
[KRILLIN]
Everything's gonna be okay!

199
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,958
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laughing]

200
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:27,000
[GOKU laughs]
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN laughing]

201
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,708
[KRILLIN]
Right, Goku?

202
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,916
[GOKU] Yup!

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,125
Thanks to you guys,
we still have a chance!

204
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,833
[VEGETA thinking]
A very slim chance!

205
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,583
[GINYU] Do they think
they can just take

206
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,833
the rest of the day off?!

207
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
[JEICE] Uh, Captain,
I really need to talk

208
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,625
to you about something. It's--

209
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,625
[GINYU] What lovely balls.

210
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,541
[JEICE] I understand. Burtur,
Recoom are--

211
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,333
[GINYU] I thought you
knew better than to

212
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:52,500
interrupt me when I'm
talking, Jeice, hmmm?

213
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,041
[GINYU laughs]

214
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,958
When Frieza figures out
how to use these things,

215
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:01,958
and you know he will,
we'll be completely unstoppable!

216
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Imagine working for the most
powerful man in the universe!

217
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,500
How's that for a 401k?!

218
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,500
[GINYU] Okay,
this is ridiculous!

219
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,208
Where are Burtur
and Recoome?!

220
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:17,041
[JEICE] Well... they
won't be coming back, sir...

221
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,833
[GINYU] Jeice, are you
saying that two members

222
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,458
of the most illustrious
fighting squad in the universe

223
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,583
have been defeated
by just one man?!

224
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,833
[JEICE] Yes, Sir!
That's exactly what I'm saying!

225
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,500
[GINYU]
And where were you?!

226
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,833
Well, I was right there
with them, and then I took off!

227
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,041
[GINYU] You idiot!
I know what's up!

228
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,625
You ran away, didn't you?!

229
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
How dare you show your
orange, little face back here!

230
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,541
You're such a disgrace!

231
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,125
Have you learned anything
after all this time?!

232
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,791
But this guy was
unbelievably strong!

233
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,166
I'm sorry, Captain.

234
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,583
[GINYU growls]

235
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:10,125
[thinking] Guldo, Recoome,
and Burtur... All gone!

236
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,541
Men, good news!

237
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,708
Your chances of making the
squad have just increased!

238
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,166
There are now four
openings on the team!

239
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,041
[RECRUITS cheer]

240
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,083
[JEICE]
But, Captain Ginyu!

241
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:20,375
I'm still here!
We only need three!

242
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,666
[GINYU]
Silence!

243
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,125
You no longer have a
place on the Ginyu Force!

244
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,416
[JEICE] Hmm?!

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,750
[GINYU]
That is, unless...

246
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:32,791
[GINYU laughs]

247
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,541
Unless you can strike a
pose that shows these guys

248
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,833
what being a Ginyu is about!

249
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,875
I'll try my best, sir!

250
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,500
[GINYU] Alright, men!
Look sharp!

251
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,166
This is your first mission!

252
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,666
I want you to dig a hole and
bury those Dragon Balls!

253
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,125
[RECRUITS] Yes, Sir!

254
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:58,291
[RECRUITS grunting]

255
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,750
Dig with style, mates!

256
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,375
You're not convicts!
You're the Ginyus!

257
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:09,208
[RECRUITS grunting
and murmuring]

258
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,083
[JEICE] The one on
the left has pinache.

259
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,625
And he's a heck of a lot
better looking than Burtur.

260
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:21,750
[RECRUITS grunting]

261
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,541
[JEICE chuckles]

262
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,208
[JEICE] Not too shabby, Captain!
This lot knows how to dig!

263
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,625
Yes. Yes, they do.

264
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,666
Now, men, I'll be
leaving you for a while

265
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,708
to take care of some business.

266
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,791
Line up!

267
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,041
[RECRUITS panting]

268
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,916
[GINYU] I want you to sit
this one out and watch

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,208
but pay close attention!

270
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:48,333
[GINYU]
We are...

271
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:49,666
the Ginyu...

272
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,375
--Wooah!
--Force!

273
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:02,000
It's just not the same
without the other guys! Ah...

274
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,208
We're like two puppies

275
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,250
that have been seperated
from their litter!

276
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,708
That guy is gonna
pay dearly for this!

277
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,166
Ya hear me?!

278
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,458
[JEICE whimpers]

279
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,916
[JEICE] I hear you, Cap'n!

280
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
[BULMA] My Dad couldn't
have been that far off

281
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,166
with Goku's arrival time.

282
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,583
He should've
been here by now.

283
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,125
Maybe Goku already
came and won the day

284
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,541
and they all went back
happily to Earth together

285
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,500
and forgot about me...

286
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,916
No, Goku wouldn't
forget about me!

287
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,333
He just couldn't!

288
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,583
Heck, I've known him since
he was just a little guy!

289
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:43,291
[BULMA sighs]

290
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,458
Those were the days...

291
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
What's the use?! Ugh!

292
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,000
[BULMA] Oh, Goku...

293
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,500
[BULMA sighs]

294
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,000
You won't forget me. I know.

295
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,166
[GOHAN]
What do we do now, Dad?!

296
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,208
[KRILLIN] Yeah, where
do we go from here?

297
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,583
[GOKU] Hey, Vegeta!

298
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,500
You know Frieza and the
others alot better than us.

299
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,750
How would you suggest we
approach the situation?

300
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:19,916
Oh, it's quite simple.

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,125
All you have to do
is finish Frieza.

302
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,833
You don't think
I can do it, do ya?

303
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,250
I know! King Kai warned
me about Frieza as well

304
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,750
and told me to stay
away from him at all costs!

305
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,458
[VEGETA] Good advice.

306
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,125
But, heck, if we could
get to the Dragon Balls

307
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,875
and wish our friends
from Earth back,

308
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,291
we might have a chance!

309
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,875
[VEGETA] 
You friends from Earth...

310
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,875
If you think they're going to
tip the scales in your favor,

311
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,541
you're out of your mind!

312
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,750
But I have an idea.

313
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:47,500
Let me wish for immortality
and we'll win for sure!

314
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,958
You can forget that!

315
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,000
There's no way we're going
to create an immortal Vegeta

316
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:53,166
to go around terrorizing
the universe!

317
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,166
[VEGETA] Heh!

318
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,250
Huh?!

319
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,208
[KRILLIN]
Two big powers coming!

320
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,541
Oh, great! They're heading
right for us, aren't they?

321
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,958
You'd better believe it.

322
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,875
Jeice, the one your Dad let go,

323
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:09,375
is coming back with
Captain Ginyu!

324
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,583
[VEGETA] Oh, now
you've done it, Kakarot!

325
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,875
You're not having
any regrets, are you?

326
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
Hey, shut up!

327
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,458
We're here for you, Goku!

328
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,333
You just tell us what
to do, and we'll do it!

329
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,625
Wait a second! If those
guys are coming here

330
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,041
and I can't sense Frieza over
there, where their ship is!

331
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,500
Kakarot, quick,
help me locate Frieza!

332
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,708
[GOKU] Right!
No problem!

333
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,083
[KRILLIN] I don't get it.
What's the big deal?

334
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:44,708
[VEGETA] The big deal is if

335
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,875
the Dragon Balls are
at their spaceship

336
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,625
and Frieza isn't there
for some reason...

337
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,666
[KRILLIN] then Captain Ginyu
and the orange guy are leaving

338
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,958
the Dragon Balls
unguarded to come here!

339
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,000
[VEGETA] Precisely!

340
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,000
[GOKU] There's a huge
power in that direction,

341
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
but it's pretty far off!

342
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,250
That's him.
It's unmistakable now.

343
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,541
[GOHAN] Uh, oh.
That's Guru's place!

344
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:06,916
This is not good.

345
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,458
Guru's old, he can't
defend himself!

346
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,208
And that's not all.

347
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,583
That's right!
Guru created the Dragon Balls!

348
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:15,958
So, if Frieza destroys him,

349
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,333
then that means the Dragon Balls
are history as well!

350
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:19,250
Say what?!

351
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,666
You mean if some
old Namek dies,

352
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,375
the Dragon Balls will vanish?!

353
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,708
[GOKU]
All things must pass.

354
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,291
Not even the Dragon
Balls last forever!

355
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,208
[KRILLIN] Hey wait, Frieza
wouldn't hurt Guru if he knew!

356
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,208
But he doesn't know.

357
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,916
Poor Guru! He wouldn't
tell Frieza either!

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,750
He'd rather die than
let the Dragon Balls

359
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,708
be used for any kind of evil!

360
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,166
I wish there was some
way for us to help out...

361
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,833
[GURU] Yes, I see
you have been brave

362
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,875
and giving in your struggle.

363
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,708
I have a gift for you that might
help you in your endeavors.

364
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,833
He's so good he reminds you of
a Grandfather or something,

365
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,041
how could anyone want to
hurt such a great guy?!

366
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,916
[VEGETA] What world
do you live in?!

367
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,083
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN] Huh?!

368
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,666
[GOKU] Cool it, guys!
We've got company!

369
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,458
[VEGETA gasps]

370
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,916
Huh?!

371
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,875
Dad!

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,833
Meet the boss, Matey!
His name is Cap'n Ginyu

373
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,583
and he'd like to have
a few words with you

374
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,833
concerning our
encounter earlier!

375
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,041
[KRILLIN] Hey, uh, Goku,

376
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:45,833
I think now would be a good
time for a plan!

377
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,291
Krillin, you and Gohan
are going to take off!

378
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,750
Get the Dragon Radar

379
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:52,208
and see if you can get your
hands on the Dragon Balls!

380
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,250
Alright. Let's see...

381
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:03,083
housand!
[GINYU] The Scouter
says... five

382
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,458
[JEICE] That's impossible!

383
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,750
Somehow he can hide his true
level from the scouter!

384
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,958
Shut up, Jeice!

385
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,416
Huh?

386
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,583
evel,
Of course he's hiding
his true power

387
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,791
that's ridiculously obvious!

388
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,500
You're looking at a
rare fighter there!

389
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,500
A guy like this one can
quadruple his fighting power

390
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,541
in an instant!

391
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,666
I estimate when
he really gets going

392
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,541
housand or maybe more!
he'll have a power level of
sixty

393
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,791
What?! Sixty thousand!
But he said he was a Saiyan!

394
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,791
No bloody Saiyan that we've
ever met is that strong!

395
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,541
[GINYU] Well, this one is!
Think about it!

396
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
He might be a mutant like us!

397
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,583
I mean, he's
definitely different!

398
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,916
He's the first Saiyan
I've seen without a tail!

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,333
What a magnificent
opportunity to showcase

400
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,541
my fabulous strength. Heh!

401
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,875
A chance to reveal
the full extent

402
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,875
of my grandeur in battle.

403
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,208
You gotta love it.

404
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,291
Alright, guys.
It's time for you to leave.

405
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,541
You can do it!

406
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,083
Get the radar, and then
go get the Dragon Balls!

407
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,666
But what about you, Dad?

408
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,250
You know there's no way we can
leave you here all by yourself!

409
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,000
[GOKU]
I'll be fine, Gohan!

410
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,083
Just concentrate on
doing your part!

411
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,458
[KRILLIN] Goku, you're enjoying
this in some strange way,

412
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,166
aren't you?!

413
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,750
[GOKU] Kinda.

414
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,625
Let's get out of here and let
your Dad do his thing, Gohan.

415
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,625
Don't forget we've got
own mission to finish!

416
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,083
Piccolo and the others...

417
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,500
Now you're talking,
you guys!

418
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,125
You have a part
in the plan, too!

419
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,958
If that's okay with you.

420
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,000
I was hoping that
we could join forces

421
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,333
and work together
against those guys.

422
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,166
Well, how does that sound
to you, Vegeta, will you do it?

423
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,083
Yeah, sure. Why not?

424
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,083
You're gonna trust him?!

425
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,625
[GOKU] Guys!
There's no time!

426
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,041
Now, let's go!

427
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,083
We're on it.

428
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,541
You got it, Goku!

429
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:42,166
[JEICE] Hey!
There they go!

430
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,458
Let 'em go! Big deal.

431
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,750
I don't know why your dad
has to trust that guy!

432
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,375
I hear ya!
It's too risky!

433
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:54,916
[GURU coughs]

434
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,583
[DENDE]
Guru, are you okay?

435
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,125
Well, I guess
it's now or never!

436
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,458
And I'm right behind you.

437
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,791
[VEGETA chuckles]

438
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,166
[VEGETA yells]

439
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,875
Have fun, Kakarot!

440
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,541
[VEGETA laughs]

441
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,583
Man, you dirty dog!

442
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,166
Prepare to die!

443
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,750
[GINYU laughs]

444
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,583
[NARRATOR] With Vegeta leaving
our hero to fend for himself,

445
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:52,166
will Goku have the power to
defeat the fierce Captain Ginyu?

446
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,583
Find out on the next
Dragon Ball Z!
