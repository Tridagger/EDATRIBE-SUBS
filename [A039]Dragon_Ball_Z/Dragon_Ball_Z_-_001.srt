Good one, Billy!

00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:41,125
[NARRATOR]
Five years have passed

5
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,500
since Goku and his friends

6
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,791
thwarted the evil
King Piccolo's plans

7
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,791
for global conquest.

8
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,458
Thanks to their
heroic efforts,

9
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,166
the shadow of doom was
lifted from the world,

10
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,625
and a new day of
hope has dawned.

11
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,958
For in the years since
Piccolo's defeat,

12
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,208
it has been a time
of rebuilding, healing,

13
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,458
prosperity, and peace
for the citizens of Earth.

14
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,416
But, unknown to them,
at this very moment,

15
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,875
a new threat to
humankind is hurtling

16
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,166
through the
solar system.

17
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,833
And as the mysterious invader
makes its final approach

18
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,958
to Earth, one
thing is certain:

19
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,041
The peaceful era the
human race has enjoyed

20
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,875
for the last
five years

21
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,916

It's time to
come in! Gohan!

Ah!

27
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,333
This one ought to do.

Goku, do you think you've
got enough fire wood there?

[GOKU grunts]

34
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,875
[GOKU] Yeah.

35
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,458
This should last us a
while, don't you think?

36
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,208
[CHICHI] Ugh. You're
going to hurt yourself

37
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:53,833
doing that one
of these days.

38
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,958
[GOKU] Aww, I'm fine.
Where's Gohan?

[CHICHI]
I don't know...

40
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,083
But I think you'd better
go find him, don't you?

41
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,833
You two are supposed be at
Master Roshi's pretty soon.

00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,958
Oh, yeah!
That's right!

43
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,458
[CHICHI] You better
take the flying nimbus.

go check it out.

Your power
level is puny.

00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,416
Heh. Level 5.

00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,958
Don't you come any closer!
Look! I'll use this thing!

00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,166
I'm trying to find
a man named Kakarot.

184
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,125
I thought you were him.

185
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:52,625
[PICCOLO]
Well, you thought wrong.

186
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,875
Now turn around and get out
of here, before I get angry!

187
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,041
Someone's having
a bad day.

188
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,791
Believe me, you have
no idea. Now get lost.

189
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,708
[RADITZ laughs]

190
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,291
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

191
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:09,291
Power level 322.

192
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,333
I can tell you're
not from this planet...

193
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,333
But you'd be a
fool to attack me

194
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:17,875
with such an...
insufficient power.

195
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,291
Now listen to me!
You came here!

196
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:23,083
I have no intention
of starting a fight!

197
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,708
I do.

198
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,041
[PICCOLO growls]

199
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:31,625
[PICCOLO thinking] All right!

200
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,375
If that's the way
he wants it...

201
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,791
[PICCOLO grunts]

202
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,625
Aahhh!

203
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,208
Heh.

204
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,500
Huh?!

205
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,708
[RADITZ laughs]

206
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,333
[RADITZ]
Impressive!

207
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,625
You actually managed to
singe some of my leg hair.

208
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:57,583
But allow me to demonstrate
a more effective attack.

209
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:03,666
It's one of my favorites.
I call it a Double Sunday.

210
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,416
Now... See if you
can follow this one!

211
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,666
[beeping]

212
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,625
Well, I guess it's your
lucky day, green man.

213
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:19,208
[beeping]

214
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:23,416
There it is. just on the edge
of my scouter's range.

215
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,791
And it's big...

216
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:28,208
It must be the largest
power level on this planet!

217
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:31,291
It's Kakarot...
This time I'm sure!

218
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,166
[panting]

219
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't believe it...

220
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:49,750
I hit him full force,
and he didn't even flinch!

221
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,416
This guy could
be a problem.

222
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,250
Have you forgotten
your pride, Kakarot?

223
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,208
We are Saiyans... The mightiest
warriors in the universe!

224
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,833
I can still remember
the day that we first

225
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,875
sent you to this
planet as an infant...

226
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,500
We had high hopes for
you then, Kakarot.

227
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:26,375
Why have you not carried
out your mission?

228
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,416
Kakarot!

229
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:32,000
[NARRATOR] Who is this
mysterious Saiyan warrior

230
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,958
that now darkens the
skies with his presence?

231
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:37,041
His search for the
one named Kakarot

232
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,875
has already led
him to Piccolo...

233
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,208
One of the most powerful
fighters on Earth.

234
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,666
Could it lead him
to Goku as well?

235
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,875
The answers to these
burning questions

236
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,708
will soon
be revealed...

237
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:50,708
And Goku will discover
the secrets of his past!

238
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:54,708
Next time on
Dragon Ball Z!
