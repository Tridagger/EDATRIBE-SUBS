00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,000
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,041
Vegeta let down his
defenses during his

3
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,208
life and death struggle
with Majin Buu

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,000
and displayed his
affection for his son.

5
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:26,791
The cold exterior had been
melted away by the love within.

6
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,208
[VEGETA]
You've made me proud, my son.

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,750
[TRUNKS grunts]

8
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,875
What did you do to him?!

9
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,333
Why'd you do that?!

10
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,250
[GOTEN grunts]

11
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,208
[NARRATOR] But it didn't
take long for Vegeta

12
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,166
to show the more
"practical" side

13
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,583
of his love for
Trunks and Goten.

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,333
With an adversary like
Majin Buu on the horizon,

15
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,916
Vegeta didn't need
any distractions.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,083
He was planning on
going all the way,

17
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,125
and he didn't want to take

18
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,666
the well-meaning
youngsters with him!

19
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,583
[NARRATOR] Vegeta knew that
this fight was to the death!

20
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:08,208
[VEGETA chuckles]

21
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,500
You're a fool.
I'm going to crush you.

22
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,625
And throw you into the wind!

23
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,083
Huh...?

24
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:25,166
[thinking] Trunks, Bulma,
I do this for you.

25
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,625
[NARRATOR] In an attempt to
blow Buu to smithereens,

26
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,666
Vegeta unleashed a
horrible attack

27
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,416
of unfathomable magnitude!

28
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,416
But can the mighty prince
survive the blast himself?

29
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:53,000
[VEGETA screaming]

30
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:04,666
[BUU screams]

31
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:14,250
[VEGETA screaming]

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,375
[KRILLIN yells]

33
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,000
[KRILLIN]
Has he lost his mind or what?!

34
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,916
It's too much! He could die!

35
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,750
What has he done?!

36
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,833
Vegeta, I can't let him do this!

37
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,166
[KRILLIN]
Piccolo, wait!

38
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,000
It's too late!
You know as well as I do

39
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,333
he can't survive
a blast like that!

40
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,333
Let him finish
what he started!

41
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,041
Remember, even you yourself said
that for the first time,

42
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,916
Vegeta's risking his own own
life for the sake of others!

43
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
[KRILLIN]
He needs this, Piccolo!

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,958
Nobody's making him do it!

45
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,375
[CHICHI] I don't know who this
Majin Buu thinks he is,

46
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,916
but if he even lays a
finger on my boys...

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,208
[YAMCHA] Uh, ChiChi, you didn't
bring any guns on board, did ya?

48
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:19,708
[CHICHI]
No, of course not!

49
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,791
M-Maybe a grenade
or two, though...

50
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,333
Videl, you're absolutely sure
that's where they went, right?!

51
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:27,250
I mean, you actually
heard them say

52
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,791
they were going to fight
this Majin Buu character?!

53
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,083
Yes...

54
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,625
You know, I hate to say it,

55
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,916
but I resent the fact that
you let Gohan and the boys go.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,625
You could've at least
stopped Goten and Trunks.

57
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm so sorry, ChiChi!
I wasn't using my head!

58
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,291
I should've tried to stop them!

59
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,250
Hey, whoa! I wouldn't feel
too bad if I were you.

60
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,333
Those little imps
would've found a way!

61
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,625
Even if you told 'em a thousand
times they couldn't go!

62
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:57,208
Stopping Pre-K Super Saiyans
from going to a fight

63
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,875
is virtually
impossible! Trust me!

64
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,208
Gee, thanks...

65
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:03,375
[YAMCHA] Sure! Anyway,
there's no mistaking

66
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,250
they went this way, huh?!

67
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,000
Right! They went
straight ahead! For sure!

68
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,125
[YAMCHA]
Hold on, guys!

69
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,166
I'm gonna put the
hammer down a bit!

70
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:18,625
[thinking]
Vegeta...

71
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,375
How could you be so reckless?

72
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:25,666
How could you kill all of those
people? It doesn't make sense!

73
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,125
Vegeta!

74
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:43,375
[screaming]

75
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,916
Ohh! Vegeta!

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,625
No! How could he...?

77
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:54,958
This is too awful. There must
be some kind of mistake!

78
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,416
[CROWD scremaing]

79
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,583
[thinking] And that horrible
grimace on his face!

80
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,000
He looked like a
bloodthirsty animal!

81
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,625
Hey, Bulma! Lighten up,
would ya? Come on.

82
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,333
The worst that could happen is
that one of us gets killed!

83
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,833
And if that happens,

84
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,250
we just wish 'em back with the
Dragon Balls! No big deal!

85
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh? If that's the case,
you wont mind if I kill you!

86
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:20,458

Look what you've done,
you idiot!

90
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,291
Straighten this thing out
or I'll kick your butt!

No need! I've got it!
Everything's under control!

93
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,333
Look, I know you're
troubled, Bulma,

94
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:38,708
but he wasn't normal when
he killed those people!

95
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,250
The Vegeta we know may be
arrogant and hotheaded,

96
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,375
but he would never do something
like what we saw today!

97
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,041
Yeah! They did something to him!

98
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,000
[BULMA thinking] If they
did do something to you,

99
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,250
you need to fight it and
get back to the way you were!

100
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,500
[YAMCHA] Wow, look, guys,
something's brewing up there!

101
00:07:57,583 --> 00:08:00,333
[ROSHI] Yeah, I see it!
But what the heck is it?!

102
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,625
Huh...?

103
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,250
I dunno, but the instruments
are going haywire!

104
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,708
Uh-oh...!

107
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,166
[ROSHI] I've fallen,
and I can't get up!

108
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,416
Hey! You're making
her cry! Stop it!

109
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,333
I'm not doing anything!

110
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
[YAMCHA]
If this keeps up,

111
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,583
this whole ship is
gonna shake apart!

113
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,041
That got the old heart rate up!

114
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,375
[YAMCHA]
Yeah! Sorry, guys!

115
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,291
I should have had the
fasten seat belt sign on!

116
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,208
[ROSHI] Mmm! That was
no common turbulence!

117
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,416
That was the after shock of
an incredible explosion!

horrible feeling in my heart?!

What's happened to you?!

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,666
[YAMCHA]
Uh-oh! This isn't good!

123
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,500
Darn it! The controls,
they're not responding anymore!

00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,833

or we're all going to die!

130

without any engines?!

[KRILLIN] No, are you sensing
what I'm sensing, Piccolo?

completely disappeared!

to go check things

out over there
on the battlefield.

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,875
Take care of these
two, would you?

149
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,625
I'm going, too! I'd like the
chance to pay my last respects.

150
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,500
[PICCOLO] Nothing personal,
but I'd rather go alone.

151
00:11:55,583 --> 00:12:00,625
Huh? I gotcha. Yeah.
Buu might still be alive.

152
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:01,958
[PICCOLO]
I don't think so,

153
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,375
but there's no sense in
taking any chances.

154
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,208
Here. Make sure nothing
happens to them, okay?

155

[KRILLIN]
Don't worry...

156
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,125
I-I'll take care of them.
Just be careful, okay?

157

I will...

158
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,000
[PICCOLO]
Oh, yeah, one more thing.

159
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,208
Huh?

160
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,708
[PICCOLO]
I'm going to have to ask you

161
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,500
to do something, Krillin,
and it's not going to be easy.

162
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,125
[KRILLIN]
I can do it. What is it?

163
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,333
Tell the others about
what happened here today.

164
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:30,541
Right, but what do you mean?
What should I say?

165
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,625
I'm not sure
what happened to Goku.

166

He may still be around

167
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,916
but apparently Gohan was
killed by Majin Buu!

Gohan?! Wait...
Wait, are you sure?

169

I'm afraid so, Krillin.

before he died.

00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,291
[PICCOLO]
Go now, I'm counting on you.

173
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,291
[KRILLIN]
Hey, wait, Piccolo!

174
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,750
How am I s'posed to...?

175
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,375
Ahh, great! Why me?
That's not fair!

176
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,250
I'd much rather fight Buu...

177
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,583
Say now, you think you'll be
done this year, Mr. Fix-it?!

178
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,083
[YAMCHA] I think you're
underestimating the damage!

179
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,000
That was quite an explosion!
We're lucky to be alive!

180
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,375
Yeah! You saved our lives,
18! Thank you!

181
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,666
[thinking]
Vegeta... Trunks...

182
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,833
[thinking]
I don't sense anything...

183
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,916
...but that's
definitely the place.

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,166
[grunts]

185
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,375
He went out
with a bang, all right!

186
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,083
Wow, what power it must've taken
to produce a crater like that.

187
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,625
Vegeta...

188
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,083
[thinking]
No sign of Buu...

189
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,083
I think it worked, Vegeta.

190
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,000
[thinking]
Wait a second!

191
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:51,500
There's Buu.
Or what's left of him.

192
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,041
He's been blown into
a thousand pieces.

193
00:14:58,458 --> 00:14:59,916
[thinking]
Now I understand.

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,125
Buu would simply regenerate
if damaged in the normal way.

195
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,000
So you had to make an
attack powerful enough

196
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,666
to blow him to bits.

197
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,666
[PICCOLO thinking] Well,
you did it, Vegeta! It worked.

198
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,708
Your sacrifice wasn't in vain.

199
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,875
I've walked through
that door before.

200
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,625
I know it's not easy.

201
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,416
[thinking] Especially for a
selfish guy like you.

202
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,458
Oh, I was just like you once.
Until Gohan's love changed me.

203
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,375
I know you were changed, too.

204
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,458
I know how much courage it
took to do what you did.

205
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,583
[PICCOLO thinking]
Goodbye, my friend.

206
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:53,333
[BABIDI whimpers]

207
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:59,791
[BABIDI whimpers]

208
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,458
Help me, please!

209
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:06,583
[PICCOLO]
Help you? Why should I?

210
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,916
[BABIDI]
Please!

211
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,750
[PICCOLO] When you help others,
you receive help!

212
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,291
When's the last time you used
your powers to help someone?

213
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,791
I'll bet it's been
a while, hasn't it?

214
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,125
[growls] Help! Don't lecture me!

215
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,000
You don't like
being hurt, do you?!

216
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,041
But you delight in
hurting others!

217
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,375
You're right,
you don't need a lecture,

218
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,625
you need to be exterminated!

219
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,000
[BABIDI]
No!

220
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,875
Huh?!

221
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,833
[BUUS squeaking]

222
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,291
They're alive!

223
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,416
How is this possible?!
He's-He's regenerating!

224
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,375
There are hundreds of them!

225
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:55,625
[BUUS squeaking]

226
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,333
[BUUS giggling]

227
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,166
[thinking]
This is insane!

228
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,791
[gasps]

229
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:17,375
[BUUS cheer]

230
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,041
[thinking]
This can't be happening!

231
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:41,500
[BUUS giggle]

232
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:44,291
[BUU]
Ready! Buu!

233
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:57,125
[BUU grunts]

234
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,041
[whimpers]

235
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,791
[PICCOLO thinking]
What kind of creature is he?!

236
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,333
He was in a million pieces!

237
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,333
How can we beat a
monster like that?!

238
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,666
[gasps]

239
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,916
[thinking] I'd better get out of
here while I still can!

240
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,916
[whimpers]

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,375
[PICCOLO growls]

242
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,791
[PICCOLO thinking]
We're done for!

243
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,416
Not even Goku has what it
takes to deal with that!

244
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,041
Buuuuuuuuu!

245
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,166
[BUU giggles]

246
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,375
Ha-ha-ha, ooh-ooh-ooh!

247
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:42,458
[screams, giggles]

248
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,375
[BABIDI]
Majin Buu! Help me!

249
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,625
Please...!

250
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,458
Uh-ho! You stuck in hole?

251
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,541
You fool! Of course I'm stuck!

252
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:59,333
I only have one arm left!
And not a leg to speak of!

253
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,833
Buu no help! Buu no can help!

254
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,166
[BABIDI]
What are you talking about?!

255
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,166
I know darn well that you
can help me! Now, do it!

256
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,833
Oh! You do first!
What happened? You tell.

257
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,333
[BABIDI]
What does it matter?

258
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,041
Just hurry up and help me,
lame-brain! It's not important!

259
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,833
Yes, yes! Buu want
to know now! You tell NOW!

260
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:21,916
Majin Buu, will you be quiet?!
Just get me back to normal!

261
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,416
Back to normal? Back to normal?
No! Never normal!

262
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,666
Never normal! Can't go back!
Can't go back!

263
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,208
Hurry up, Majin Buu!

264
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,125
Do you realize what
will happen if I die?!

265
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,250
If I'm gone, no one will
be left to set you free

266
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,291
if you get sealed up again!

267
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,041
[BABIDI]
Ahh! At last!

268
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,750
It looks like I
finally penetrated

269
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,500
that rubber head of yours!

270
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,208
Now fix me up before
I keel over and die!

271
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:57,666
[whimpers]

272
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,166
[BABIDI gasps]

273
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,083
[BABIDI] Oh, that feels good!
Thank you very much, Buu!

274
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,708
Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

275
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,291
That green freak
and those two brats

276
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,000
are going to pay for
their hand in this!

277
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,333
[growls] There'll be no quick
end for those scoundrels!

278
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,583
We're going to make
them suffer, Buu!

279
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:15,791
The three of them will
be begging for death!

280
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,375
[BABIDI giggles]

281
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,500
They'll discover what it means
to make war with Babidi and Buu!

282
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,791
Pain and agony will
become their bedfellows!

283
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,333
Their lives will
become a cesspool

284
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:28,333
in which foul things breed!
Darkness will be their light!

285
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,083
If you look suffering
up in the dictionary

286
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,458
you'll see a picture
of the three of them!

287
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,833
[BABIDI giggles]

288
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:45,875
[PICCOLO]
Krillin!

289
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,333
Huh?!

290
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,000
[KRILLIN]
Piccolo?

291
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
Hey, what's up?

292
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
We're in big trouble,
that's what!

293
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,958
Take those two to the
Lookout, immediately!

294
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:59,041
What's going on?
What about that big blast?

295
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,291
Vegeta's attack!
Don't tell me it failed!

296
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,041
No one could have survived that!

297
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,916
Piccolo! Buu's alive! Isn't he?!

298
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,791
Yes, Buu survived!
He's alive and well!

299
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:16,416
No! Impossible!
What about Vegeta?!

300
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,875
There wasn't even
a shred left of him!

301
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,875
[KRILLIN] But if that
attack didn't affect Buu

302
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,250
then there's no hope!

303
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,458
There is hope!

304
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:29,416
But if Buu finds it, he'll
destroy it! It's these two.

305
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,583
[KRILLIN]
Huh?

306
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,875
[PICCOLO]
Goten and Trunks.

307
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,000
They need to be safeguarded

308
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,666
until they're ready
for the challenge.

309
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,125
It may take some time,

310
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,500
but they're the only
chance we have left.

311
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,666
[PICCOLO]
Son of Goku... Son of Vegeta...

312
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,416
The future of the Earth
depends on you two!

313
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,083
[BABIDI] Whoo-hoo! Let's raise
some cane, Majin Buu!

314
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:57,083
A little killing
spree is in order!

315
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,125
[BABIDI laughs]

316
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,666
Destroy everything in
sight! Everything!

317
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,125
And let's lure those three
meddlers out of hiding.

318
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:22,375
[SUPREME KAI]
Gohan... You've got to be alive!

319
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:24,916
[SUPREME KAI]
Where are you...?

320
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:33,541
[NARRATOR]
As Supreme Kai continues

321
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,541
his desperate search for Gohan,

322
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:38,041
the rejuvenated Babidi
and Majin Buu

323
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,041
are terrorizing the
inhabitants of Earth.

324
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,125
Vegeta has already
given his life

325
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:47,625
trying to stop the evil Buu,
and Gohan is at death's door,

326
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,625
hanging on by a mere thread!
