1
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,875
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,416
Now Dragon Balls,
grant me my wish!

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,875
[NARRATOR] With all seven
Dragon Balls in his possession,

4
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:21,958
Frieza's victory
seemed certain!

5
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,000
However, making a
wish proved to be

6
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,958
more difficult
than expected...

7
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,791
Maybe it already
came true.

8
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:31,458
No! There must be some secret
to unlocking their power!

9
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,541
[NARRATOR] As Frieza
raced off in search

10
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,875
of the information he needed,

11
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,708
elsewhere, Gohan was
fighting for his life

12
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,541
and the lives of his friends
against the sinister Recoome!

13
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,958
[GOHAN] No...
It's not over... Yet...

14
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,458
I'm not gonna
let you win!

15
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,708
Now... Here's your doom!

16
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:53,333
[BOTH grunt]

17
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,375
[NARRATOR] But despite
his most valiant efforts,

18
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:59,208
the young warrior proved no
match for the towering Recoome.

19
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,208
[NARRATOR] With Gohan
down for the count,

20
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,708
it looked like our heroes'
chances for survival

21
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,250
had finally run out...
When suddenly...

22
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,458
[NARRATOR] A lone spaceship
appeared in the skies,

23
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:16,291
and came rocketing down
to the planet's surface!

24
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:19,041
But if the new arrival wasn't
one of Frieza's henchmen,

25
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,750
who else
could it be?

26
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,791
Maybe some Nameks?

27
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,416
Poor dopes! They
shoulda stayed gone...

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
[NARRATOR] No...
This was no Namek...

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,541
The Ginyu Force
will have to contend

30
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:33,750
with the might
of Goku! Today!

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:44,958
[KING KAI] Huh?!

32
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,166
Hm?

33
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,958
[KING KAI] He made it!
Goku's there!

34
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,083
The others are still in
trouble, but if he hurries,

35
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,083
there may be hope
for them yet!

36
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,625
It's a slim
hope, granted.

37
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:57,958
But if there's anyone who
can save them, it's Goku!

38
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,416
Yes...

39
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,916
[COMPUTER] Attention.
Landing complete.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,291
Welcome to
Planet Namek.

41
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,708
Passengers are now free
to move about the cabin.

42
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,833
Please watch your step
as you exit the craft,

43
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:29,750
and as always, thank you
for flying Capsule Corp.

44
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,500
What the...? Who
the heck is that?

45
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

46
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,041
It's Goku! I knew it...
I knew he'd make it!

47
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,000
[thinking] Wow...

48
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,750
I'm sensing some really
big powers out there.

49
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,916
Evil powers...

50
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,833
Hang on, guys...
Gohan, Krillin, Bulma...

51
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:24,708
[thinking] Hmm... Over there.
That's the biggest one...

52
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,875
[thinking] And there's number
two, the second strongest!

53
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,791
But what about
Gohan and Krillin?

54
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,041
Why can't I sense
where they are?

55
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,750
Huh? That's why!
They're barely alive!

56
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,000
Their power...
It's almost down to zero!

57
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,625
I had no idea that I
was cutting it so close!

58
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,708
There's not another
minute to spare!

59
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,500
[GOKU growls]

60
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,125
All right then...
This is it!

61
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
It's finally time
to see if all that

62
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,958
100-times gravity
training paid off!

63
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,833
[BOTH gasp]

64
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,333
[JEICE] I don't like
the way this feels!

65
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,166
What the
heck is it?!

66
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,291
[RECOOME yells]

67
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,625
[RECOOME yelling]

68
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,500
[RECOOME gasps]

69
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,416
Gohan...

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,791
Hah... Kakarot. Of course...

71
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,250
So he finally
decided to show up...

72
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,291
[KRILLIN chuckles]

73
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,625
[KRILLIN] Goku!

74
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,750
[GOKU] Hey, Krillin!
I brought you a surprise!

75
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,375
Hold on! I'll
be right there!

76
00:07:02,458 --> 00:07:05,750
It's okay, son.
I'm here now...

77
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,166
Gohan?
Hey, son?

78
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,791
Oh, wow... You're
in really bad shape.

79
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,916
But, we can fix that...
You hear me, son?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,666
You're going to be fine,
Gohan, don't you worry!

81
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,583
Hmph! He-Hey! Who the hell
do you think you are?!

82
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,208
You can't just
barge in here!

83
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,875
[GOKU] Try to
swallow this, Gohan.

84
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,833
[RECOOME] Hey! Hello?!
I'm talkin' to you!

85
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,708
This guy's pretty
good, Burter!

86
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,625
That's quite an
entrance he made...

87
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,875
He's really fast!
Maybe even faster than you!

88
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,625
Yeah, right!
Give me a break!

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,375
See, low fighting power!
He's all show!

90
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,750
You're too easily
impressed, Jeice!

91
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,125
[GOHAN gasps]

92
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,916
Hey! How do
you feel?!

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,541
Daddy? Oh! Dad!
Is it really you?

94
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,208
[RECOOME gasps]

95
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,166
Hey... I thought you said
that kid's neck was broken!

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,750
Yeah, well...
It was!

97
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,125
[GOKU] Your mom'd kill me if
she saw how dirty you are.

98
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,166
[GOHAN] Dad! Those guys
are super-powerful!

99
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,875
[GOKU] I know. We definitely
have our work cut out for us.

100
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:09,250
But I'm here now. Just leave
everything to me, okay?

101
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,125
Yeah... sure...

102
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,625
[GOKU] So, you were taking on
that big guy over there, huh?

103
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,250
[GOHAN] Well, I tried.
But he was too strong for me.

104
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,250
[VEGETA growls]

105
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:25,166
Vegeta looks like he's
in pretty bad shape, too.

106
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,666
What happened
to him?

107
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,291
The big guy... Vegeta tried
to fight him before I did...

108
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,916
So did Krillin. But they
couldn't beat him either.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,875
[GOKU] Really? Sounds like
this guy's a real handful...

110
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,958
Yeah...
I'll say...

111
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,375
[GOKU laughs]

112
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,833
Don't worry... I've got
just what the doctor ordered!

113
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,333
See? A Senzu Bean!

114
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,250
[KRILLIN chuckles]

115
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:48,708
I'm so glad
you came...

116
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,000
But I almost
wish you hadn't...

117
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
Why, what's
the matter?

118
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,291
[KRILLIN] Those Ginyu guys.
They're just too powerful...

119
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,625
Whaaa?!

120
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,458
It's like he just touches
them and their healed!

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,875
Yeah... It's crazy!
Who is this guy?

122
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,333
Curse you...
Kakarot...

123
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,000
[KRILLIN] I'm not
trying to be negative...

124
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,000
It's just, well, I think
we're a little outclassed!

125
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,791
I know you're
really strong...

126
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
But, man!
I'm telling you!

127
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,833
We've never dealt with
anything like this!

128
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,708
These guys
are too much!

129
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,333
That's why I say I wish
you hadn't come, Goku...

130
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,125
Now they're just
gonna get you, too!

131
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,541
I mean, Vegeta couldn't
even stop 'em,

132
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,833
and he's
stonger than ever!

133
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,916
Yeah, about Vegeta...

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,333
Uhhh...

135
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,666
What was Vegeta doing fighting
them in the first place?

136
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,625
I thought he was
on their side...

137
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,708
I don't know
where to begin!

138
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,041
It's been
crazy here!

139
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,500
[GOKU] Don't speak.
This'll be a lot faster.

140
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,375
Just relax...

141
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,375
[KRILLIN] Oh,
well... Alright.

142
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,416
[GOHAN] Wh-what
are you doing, Dad?

143
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
[GOKU] I'm going to
read Krillin's mind...

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,250
Thanks...

145
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
I understand
everything...

146
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,041
How?

147
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,375
I'm not really sure!
That was my first time!

148
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,250
It's weird! I finished
my training program

149
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,958
on the ship and
something happened...

150
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,208
I didn't think it was any
big deal at the time,

151
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,625
but I guess exercising at
one-hundred times normal gravity

152
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:38,333
has its benefits!

153
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,708
What?! A hundred times?!

154
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,875
How is that possible?
You'd be crushed!

155
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,125
Nah. I guess I must have
tough skin or something...

156
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,583
I feel just fine!

157
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,750
Well, I'm really
proud of you guys

158
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:52,250
for everything you've done
so far... What an ordeal.

159
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,583
Until I saw
your thoughts,

160
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,541
I didn't realize just how
much of a struggle

161
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:56,625
it's been
for you two!

162
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:57,875
Yeah, thanks.

163
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,875
We... We tried our best
not to let you down...

164
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,791
[GOKU] Aw, neither of you
could ever let me down.

165
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,625
Now, if you'll excuse me
for a second, you guys...

166
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,500
There's a little
something I have to do.

167
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,291
Vegeta!

168
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,750
[BOTH gasp]

169
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,750
Eat it,
Vegeta!

170
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,875
Yo! Hey! We can't be sure
about Vegeta! Are you nuts?!

171
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,708
Why'd you
do that?

Listen, Goku! I hope
you know what you're doing,

because I sure don't!
You're taking a huge risk!

I owed Vegeta
a favor...

If it wasn't for him,
that guy who freezes time

179
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,000
would have
finished you guys!

Yeah, well, I guess
you've got a point there...

Hey, wait! Where
are you going now?

183
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,041
To teach these
Ginyu guys a lesson!

184
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,708
What?! You're gonna
take 'em on by yourself?

us all by yourself, huh??!

Aw, man... What the
heck is Goku thinking?

192
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,083
That hundred-times gravity
must've crushed his brain!

Kakarot is hiding

Surely Kakarot senses how
powerful these guys are!

perfectly calm...

he be hiding?

Is Kakarot...
a Super Saiyan?!

years ago!

more than a legend!

I never actually
believed it to be true!

279
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,833
Even so... There's
no way a low-class

280

like Kakarot
could achieve it!

281

According to legend,
the last Super Saiyan

282
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,500
could only maintain his status
in the transformed state!

283
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,458
His power was
extraordinary...

284
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,875
he had no equal
in the universe!

285
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,541
But he was too
primitive to control it!

286
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,625
His rage burned
so intensely

287
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,708
that it eventually
consumed him.

288
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,291
And in the end, he was
destroyed by his own power!

289
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,916
[VEGETA] But if there were a
way to achieve such power,

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,791
I should know it! I am the
Prince of all Saiyans!

291
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,666
If there is to be a new Super
Saiyan, it should be me!

be scared...

00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,500
[KRILLIN] W-whoa! Look out!

344
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,958
Here it comes!

345
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,208
[RECOOME growls]

346
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,583
Now, full power!

347
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,250
Eraser Gun!

348
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,125
[RECOOME grunts]

349
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,583
[VEGETA gasps]

350
00:20:53,958 --> 00:21:03,500
[RECOOME sputtering]

351
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,625
Sorry! I saw an opening
that seemed to scream out:

352
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:09,458
Attack!
So... I did.

353
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,166
[GOKU laughs]

354
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,208
[RECOOME grunting]

355
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,916
[GOHAN] I-Is that it?
Did Dad win?

356
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,583
Yeah... One punch!
That's crazy!

357
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,750
I just don't see
how it's possible!

358
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,083
It's like we're
in a dream!

359
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,416
The Goku we
left on Earth

360
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,166
couldn't be doing
this right now!

361
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,916
[thinking] But this isn't
the Goku we left on Earth...

362
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,791
Why is Recoome
still down?

363
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,583
Looks like he
barely touched him!

364
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,708
That attack didn't even
register on the scouters!

365
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,125
Damn! Kakarot...

366
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:55,916
The others may not have seen
the power behind that attack...

367
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,750
But you do not
deceive my eyes!

368
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:24,791
[VEGETA thinking]
With that one blow,

369
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,583
Kakarot has proved
himself stronger

370
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,541
than any Saiyan I
have ever known...

371
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,125
Perhaps any Saiyan
in a thousand years!

372
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,625
And I, the Prince
of all Saiyans,

373
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,958
have somehow become
this pauper's witness!

374
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,750
I'm the only one who
understands what he's become.

375
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:41,250
Even better than he
understands it himself!

376
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,291
Kakarot has become
a Super Saiyan!

377
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,583
[NARRATOR] What is this
Super Saiyan,

378
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:48,958
that even the mighty
Vegeta fears it?

379
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:52,291
And has Goku truly achieved
this legendary status?

380
00:22:52,375 --> 00:22:55,333
Don't miss the
next Dragon Ball Z!
