1
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,208
Crucial decisions
were being made...

3
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:21,875
I want to go with Bulma
and Krillin... Okay?

4
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,291
Sorry, Mom,
but I need to go to

5
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,458
try to help them bring
Piccolo and the others back

6
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,125
with the
Dragon Balls.

7
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,583
You should be making friends
and playing baseball

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,875
and building tree houses...
Not trying to save the world!

9
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,458
I'm going!

10
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,458
[KRILLIN] Ehh?!

11
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:43,333
Aaah! How did I raise
such a stubborn child?!

12
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:47,750
There's no time for those
childish things, anymore.

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,500
My friends are gone, and
they're not coming back!

14
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,833
I've got to go help
find the Dragon Balls.

15
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,250
Mom, Piccolo died
trying to help me,

16
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,166
so I think I should do
everything I can to help him.

17
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,958
I can't sit around and do
nothing while Piccolo needs me.

18
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:03,208
[NARRATOR] Despite the
protests of his mother,

19
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,458
Gohan chose to embark on
the long journey to Namek,

20
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:10,666
with Bulma and Krillin, in the
search for the Dragon Balls...

21
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,958
And with that, the three
young adventurers blasted off

22
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:15,458
from Earth in
Kami's spaceship,

23
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,708
and set out into the
vast expanse of space.

24
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,083
If their mission succeeds,
it will mean the return of

25
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,416
Piccolo, Kami,
and all who were lost

26
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,666
in the battle
against the Saiyans.

27
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,041
But little do these
travelers realize,

28
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,208
in a flight across the
galaxy, anything can happen.

29
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,208
And despite a
smooth start,

30
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,791
there's plenty of
turbulence ahead... Today!

31
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:07,125
[yawns]

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,041
Another boring day.

33
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this...
day seven or eight?

34
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,541
Why did I forget to
install the new sleep pods?

35
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,416
That's the one thing that could
have made this trip bearable.

36
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,291
[yawns]

37
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,041
[BULMA] You guys doing
image training again?

38
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,708
I guess that's a good way
to kill some time, huh?

39
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
Hey, are you two
even listening to me?

40
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:41,666
[GOHAN grunts softly]

41
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:47,458
[KRILLIN grunts softly]

42
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:04,291
[KRILLIN and GOHAN
yell frantically]

43
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,750
[GOHAN whimpers]

44
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,291
[KRILLIN] Yah!

45
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,541
Yaahh!

46
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,000
[GOHAN whimpers]

47
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,333
[GOHAN screams]

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,041
[panting]

49
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,791
[GOHAN gasps]

50
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,625
Ah... Wow, Gohan...
You have some awesome moves.

51
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,625
We're gonna have to
train like this everyday

52
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,166
if we're gonna be
ready for Vegeta.

53
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,458
Yeah. We can't let
ourselves get lazy and slow

54
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,666
while we're
on this trip.

55
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,916
[BULMA] Boys...

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
[KRILLIN] Uh?

57
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,500
I don't want to
interrupt your training,

58
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,416
but this place
is filthy...

59
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,041
Can't you two find a
minute to clean this mess?

60
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:53,041
[KRILLIN] Um...

61
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,375
[BULMA] I like to
run a tidy ship.

62
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,458
Sorry Bulma, but we don't eat
junk food and read magazines.

63
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,625
That's all
your mess.

64
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,791
We already cleaned
up after ourselves.

65
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,375
Yeah, but, I'm busy.

66
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,583
I have too many other important
issues to deal with right now.

67
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,250
Besides, you two
never do anything

68
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,041
to help out
around here.

69
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,083
But, Bulma, you said
you were bored!

70
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,458
Oh, you're hopeless!
And don't cry to me

71
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,750
if I forget about
making your dinner.

72
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,458
[can clatters]

73
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,916
[BULMA yawning] I have
so much to do today.

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,125
[KRILLIN] The only thing she's
busy doing is complaining.

75
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,208
[NURSE hums]

76
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,458
[GOKU grunts]

77
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,833
Huh? Oh, not again!

78
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:47,833
[GOKU grunts]

79
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,958
Four more
sets to go.

80
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,500
Mr. Goku,
stop that!

81
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,958
[GOKU] There's no need
to worry. I feel fine!

82
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,500
Can I lend you a
hand, there, Nurse?

83
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,750
[NURSE screams]

84
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,000
[ROSHI] Oh, well,
what I mean is...

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,416
I really admire the work
you ladies do here...

86
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,250
And you know, I just wanna
help in any way I can.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,458
[grunts angrily]

88
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,875
Can I offer you a
piece of sponge cake?

89
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,750
[NURSE grunts angrily]
[GOKU grunts]

90
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,958
[ROSHI] Eh?

91
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,833
[DOCTOR clears throat]

92
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:22,583
Huh?

93
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,458
Hello, doctor.

94
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,583
Goku, how many times 
have I told you?

95
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,916
In order to get better
your body needs rest.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,500
Exercising now could
do further damage.

97
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:34,416
No, I'm fine,
doctor. See?

98
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,833
[groans]

99
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,250
Now you listen up... As
long as you're in my hospital,

100
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,458
you'll do what I say
without question...

101
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,375
Do you think you
can do that for me?

102
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,458
Yeah... You're
right, doctor.

103
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,666
Please, come give the nurse
a hand... If you would, sir.

104
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,833
Um, why
certainly. I, uh...

105
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,083
Don't you have orderlies
for this sorta thing...

106
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,833
Good grief...

107
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,708
[NURSE giggles]

108
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:57,791
Eh?

109
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:58,791
[NURSE giggles]

110
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,333
It serves
you right.

111
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,416
[ROSHI] Heh, heh. ehh...

112
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,458
Do you know where I can find
the patient's wife right now?

113
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,791
Hm. Last time I saw her
she was on the roof

114
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,833
spending some
time alone.

115
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,416
I know you're out there
somewhere, Gohan...

116
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,375
And even though I wish
we could just have

117
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:31,916
a normal family life...
I'm very proud of you...

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Just promise me you'll come
back soon, healthy and safe.

119
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,083
[sighs]

120
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,375
[BULMA] Hey.

121
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,916
What?

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,750
I've been meaning to ask you
a question about that Saiyan.

123
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,083
Does anyone actually
know what happened to him?

124
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,625
Or did he just
vanish into thin air?

125
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,666
Um... What
do you mean?

126
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,958
[BULMA] I thought the Saiyans'
home planet was destroyed

127
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,833
some time ago,
wasn't it?

128
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,041
That's right...
Vegeta was badly wounded

129
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,291
when he finally
got away,

130
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,666
so he had to go
somewhere to recover.

131
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,125
But I certainly couldn't
tell you where it is...

132
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Hmm... Wait a minute,
I remember something

133
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,708
Goku's brother
Raditz said...

134
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,125
He told us the Saiyans
were planet brokers,

135
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,541
and that they took over worlds
just so they could sell them

136
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,250
to the highest bidder...

137
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,250
Raditz said Vegeta
found a buyer for Earth,

138
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,458
so maybe he's
hiding with them.

139
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,333
Yeah, I guess that
could be what happened,

140
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:36,541
but the problem is we still
have no idea where he went...

141
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,375
I mean, he could already be
on Namek as far as we know!

142
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,041
[BULMA groans]

143
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,291
Well, wherever he
is, for our sakes,

144
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,625
let's hope it's
far, far away...

145
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,750
[VEGETA grunts]

146
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,416
[thinking] Almost there...
It won't be long now.

147
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:11,875
[KRILLIN] Hmm?

148
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,250
[BULMA] Hm?
What is that?

149
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,083
[KRILLIN]
What is what?

150
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,750
[GOHAN] It's not
Planet Namek, is it?

151
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,666
I can't be. It's much
too soon to be Namek.

152
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,375
But look... Something
is coming right at us!

153
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,416
[beeping]

154
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,208
Whatever it is,
it's moving fast.

155
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,208
We should be able
to see it by now...

156
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,958
You see anything?

157
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,083
[alarm sounds]

158
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,458
There they are!
They're gonna attack!

159
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,916
[BULMA] Ahh! Oh no!

160
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,458
[BULMA and KRILLIN scream]

161
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,625
C'mon, do something!

162
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,000
[BULMA] Okay, Okay,
I know! I'll do it!

163
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,541
Fire counterattack!

164
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,541
[beeping]

165
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,791
[GOHAN and KRILLIN]
Woohoo! Yeah! Ha, ha!

166
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,625
Just hold on guys, cuz
we're not in the clear yet.

167
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,250
[beeping]

168
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,375
It looks like
a spaceship.

169
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,708
It looks almost
identical to ours.

170
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,458
Whatever it is,
it's getting closer...

171
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,583
And if it doesn't change its
course, it's gonna ram us.

172
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh no!

173
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,375
Bulma!

174
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,750
Bank left!
Bank left!

175
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,291
It's headed straight for us!
We're gonna collide!

176
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,916
Aahh! This is it!

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,083
[GROUP screams]

178
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:41,375
[alarm sounds]

179
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,458
[alarm stops]

180
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,541
[BULMA yells]

181
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,875
That was weird.

182
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,875
One second we're about to
crash into our own ship,

183
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,791
and the next we're...
Well, we're who knows where!

184
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,666
It looks like we're
on another ship.

185
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, a big one. Probably full
of big scary aliens, too.

186
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,291
Well, I hope
you're wrong.

187
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,375
[GOHAN yells]

188
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,666
[GOHAN] Hey, look at me!
I'm an alien!

189
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,833
Gohan!
That's not funny.

190
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,291
Hm. It'll do us no good
just sitting here,

191
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,166
so let's take a walk
and check the place out.

192
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,833
[KRILLIN] Um...

193
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,083
[KRILLIN grunts]

194
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,333
Let's do this.

195
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,500
[thinking] There's
something about this place

196
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,791
that gives
me the creeps.

197
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,875
But I don't know
what it is...

198
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,458
[BULMA] Oh great!

199
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,291
I forgot to put some
pants on before we left!

200
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,583
That's too bad...
It's freezing in here.

201
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,791
You think I
don't know that?

202
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,416
I'll deal with it.

203
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,875
As long as you
don't blame us

204
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,583
if you catch a
cold or something.

205
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,333
[GOHAN] Great, now
let's get moving.

206
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay,
we're going.

207
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,333
[BULMA sighs]

208
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,250
And Gohan!
Don't walk so close!

209
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,916
[KRILLIN] Is that
what I think it is?

210
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,583
[GOHAN] Uhh...

211
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,541
[BULMA] Uh!

212
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,458
[GROUP whimpers and yells]

213
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,333
[panting]

214
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,833
We need to be
more careful...

215
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,166
I'm sure that's not the last
booby trap around here.

216
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,916
Listen! You two need
to be more aware

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,291
of what's going
on around here!

218
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:25,625
I almost got my
head shot off!

219
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,916
[KRILLIN]
Uh... Eh?

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,583
[BULMA] This hallway
never seems to end.

221
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,250
There should be a door
or a vent or something,

222
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,166
don't you think?

223
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,958
[loud thuds]

224
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,833
[BULMA] Oh no!
Open this door right now!

225
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,125
[KRILLIN] Bulma,
don't worry. Stand back.

226
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,208
[BULMA] Huh?

227
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,500
Ka me...

228
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:52,541
Ha me...

229
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,791
Eh? Uh...

230
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,750
[KRILLIN yells]

231
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,666
Ah! I can't get
out of the way!

232
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,083
[BULMA yells and gasps]

233
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,125
Ka me...

234
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,750
Ha me... Haa!

235
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,041
Thanks for the
ride, Gohan.

236
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,416
Sure is sweet of you
to carry a lady.

237
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,083
[footsteps]

238
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,625
Whoever owns
this spaceship

239
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,708
sure doesn't want us to
stay too much longer.

240
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,125
[GOHAN] What if this is a...
a Saiyan spaceship?

241
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,666
What do you mean?

242
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,083
[KRILLIN] Yeah, this
could be the place

243
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:51,041
that Vegeta
went to recover.

244
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,291
Enough talk
about that guy...

245
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:56,291
Let's change the subject.
I'm getting goose bumps.

246
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,541
But wait... If this
is Vegeta's ship,

247
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:02,250
maybe he's in there
somewhere waiting for us...

248
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:06,250
I wish Goku had let me finish
him when I had the chance.

249
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,541
[VEGETA grunts]

250
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,083
[thinking]
I must recuperate!

251
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,541
I can't allow Kakarot to
gain any more time on me!

252
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,041
Wait a minute...
This doesn't make any sense.

253
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,833
The hallway is starting
to curve in on itself

254
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,708
and we still haven't
found a door.

255
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:39,083
[BULMA] Ugh! There
has to be a door.

256
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,458
Maybe it's hidden
in the walls.

257
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,916
[KRILLIN] Found it.

258
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,416
[KRILLIN grunts]

259
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,000
Huh?

260
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,000
Krillin. Another hallway
just opened up down here.

261
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,750
[BULMA]
I knew it!

262
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:04,875
Great... It must be nice
to be right all the time.

263
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,750
All right,
let's keep moving.

264
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,333
[BULMA]
Be careful, Krillin.

265
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,208
Yeah, I know.

266
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:24,041
[GROUP screams]

267
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,458
[BULMA screams]

268
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,375
[groans]

269
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:59,083
[panting]

270
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,250
Wow... I thought
I was dead.

271
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,208
Man, I'm
really hungry.

272
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,416
I'm right there
with you, Krillin.

273
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,583
[KRILLIN sniffs]

274
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,166
You smell that?

275
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,083
[GOHAN sniffs]

276
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,583
Yeah...
Smells good!

277
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,458
Look!

278
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:26,250
Whoa, let's dig in!

279
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,500
[KRILLIN and GOHAN laugh]

280
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,333
Wait! It may be
another trick!

281
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,125
This looks
really good.

282
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,500
Control yourselves.
Don't eat it yet.

283
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,250
[GOHAN] Why?

284
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,500
Aahh!

285
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,333
[embarrassed laughter]

286
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:01,583
Now that was a close call
there, wasn't it, boys?

287
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:10,291
[rumbling]

288
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,916
Aaahhhh!

289
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,583
It was a trap!

290
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,833
[BULMA] Help me!
Get me outta here!

291
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,708
[KRILLIN] You're way too slow,
Bulma. You gotta be more aware.

292
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,375
[BULMA] I don't need
any lessons right now!

293
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,625
[KRILLIN] Hang on,
I'll get you out.

294
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,416
Alright now, Bulma,
just get under that table.

295
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,125
[BULMA screams]

296
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,416
[KRILLIN] Hm?

297
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,875
[BULMA screams]

298
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,791
Krillin! Gohan!
Get me out of this rope!

299
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,208
It's starting to hurt!

300
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,041
[BOY A]
Don't move.

301
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
Don't hurt her!

302
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:58,041
[GOHAN] Bulma! Whatever
you do, don't panic!

303
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,166
Leave her alone!

304
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,875
[BULMA yells and whimpers]

305
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,000
Stay there! I don't
want to get shot!

306
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,458
[KRILLIN grunts]

307
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,708
[GOHAN and KRILLIN] Huh?

308
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,125
Krillin,
what's going on?

309
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,166
Why aren't there
any adults here?

310
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,916
Easy, everyone.
There's no need to shoot.

311
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,958
We're not here to hurt
anyone, just passing through.

312
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,250
[BULMA] Krillin!
Don't just stand there!

313
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,666
Make these stupid kids
get their guns off of me!

314
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,791
I don't know...

315
00:21:58,875 --> 00:21:59,916
[BULMA]
Do it! Quick!

316
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,666
My arms feel like
they're gonna break!

317
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,708
All right.

318
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,625
Haa!

319
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,416
[BOY B whimpers]

320
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,958
[KRILLIN grunts]

321
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,708
[BULMA] Krillin,
don't fight them!

322
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,166
[KRILLIN] Eh?

323
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,875
If you attack, they're
just gonna shoot me!

324
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:22,708
Then what should I do? Uh...

325
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,416
Uh... Got any ideas?

326
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,166
I guess we should just
give ourselves up.

327
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,833
[NARRATOR] It seems the
deeper our heroes travel

328
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,750
into this
mysterious spaceship,

329
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,291
the more troubling
questions arise!

330
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:42,375
Who are these
young soldiers,

331
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:46,500
and what do they have in store
for Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan?

332
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,583
Is there any
hope for escape?

333
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,583
The answers are
sure to come...

334
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:55,541
In the next action-packed
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
