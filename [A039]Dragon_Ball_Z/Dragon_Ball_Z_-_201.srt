00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,666
[NARRATOR]
Last time on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,125
Gohan got a gift.

3
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,208
[GOHAN] ...press this
red button to make it work?

4
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,708
[BULMA] That's it.

5
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,541
[TRUNKS] Awesome!

6
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:24,833
Does it fit?

7
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah! Why...
it's a super fit!

8
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,500
[NARRATOR]
And when a high-jacked bus

9
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,375
went over a cliff,
it was time for

10
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,333
the new superhero
to spring into action!

11
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,666
That's right!
This bus stops here.

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,708
[VIDEL] Huh?!

13
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:41,833
[NARRATOR] Going up, anyone?

14
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,583
There's a new hero in town!

15
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,791
[GOHAN] I am...
guardian of the city!

16
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,750
The one and only!

17
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,083
[NARRATOR] That's right, Gohan!
Tell them how it is!

18
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,833
[GOHAN] The Great Saiyaman!

19
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,375
[GOHAN] I'm the Great Saiyaman!
Defender of truth!

20
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:15,958
Protector of the innocent!

21
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:22,625
Upholder of justice!
Doer of... good. Aah...

22
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,541
How come when Dad
said that kind of stuff

23
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,833
it just rolled
right off of his tongue

24
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,500
and sounded so natural.

25
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,208
[GOTEN] Gee, it sounded
okay to me, Gohan!

26
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:34,291
Nah! Thanks! Lets try this.

27
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,708
Here we go!
Protector of the innocent!

28
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,500
Defender of truth!
The light in the darkness!

29
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,708
I have come to crush
the oppressors of this world

30
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:43,208
once and for all!

31
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:46,125
All right, you! Unhand her!

32
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:49,583
Stand back! This is a job for...

33
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,416
The Great Saiyaman!

34
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,791
Well, whatd'ya think?

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,333
[GOTEN]
Yeah, that was awesome!

36
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,375
It sounded even better
than the superheroes on TV!

37
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,458
Can I be a superhero, too?

38
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,375
I think one superhero's
enough for now.

39
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,875
Mom, what'd you think?
Did you hear that?

40
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,833
I think it could
still use a little work.

41
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,625
But not tonight.
You've got to get up

42
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,166
bright and early tomorrow,
Great Saiyaman.

43
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,125
No problem, Mom. I'm fine.

44
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,083
[CHICHI] Gohan!
What are you doing?!

45
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,791
I thought you were
awake already!

46
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,125
School starts in ten minutes!

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,875
[GOHAN] Oh, man! I'm gonna
have to really move!

48
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,666
[school bell chimes]

49
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,666
Aah...

50
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,375
[GIRL]
Hi! I recognize you now!

51
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,250
You're in one of
my classes, aren't you?!

52
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,875
[GOHAN] Yeah! That's right!
Uh, English, isn't it?!

53
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,416
You know, it's about to start.

54
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,083
Aren't you worried
about being late?

55
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,000
[GIRL] No, not really.

56
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,041
[GOHAN]
You know... I can explain!

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,166
[GIRL] You can, huh?

58
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,708
[GOHAN laughs nervously]

59
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,583
[GOHAN] See you in class!

60
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,958
[GOHAN thinking] Ah, man!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

61
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,791
Man! I really can't believe
I just did that!

62
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,916
I haven't even been
a superhero for a week

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,208
and I've already
blown my cover!

64
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,791
[GOHAN thinking] I'm so stupid!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

65
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,333
[GIRL thinking]
Wow! What an amazing guy!

66
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,916
And he's really cute, too!

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,125
[murmuring]

68
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,125
Gohan! You're on time!

69
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:40,541
Little miracles happen everyday!

70
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:42,500
[GOHAN sighs]

71
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,333
[door opens, closes]

72
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:45,791
Huh?!

73
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,875
[GIRL giggles]

74
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:53,500
--[GIRL] Mmm!
--[PROFESSOR] All right class,

75
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,166
let's continue where
we left off yesterday.

76
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,791
Now what did
Thoreau mean when he said:

77
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,708
"The mass of men lead lives
of quiet desperation." Videl?

78
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,125
[VIDEL]
I think that he meant that

79
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,458
most people are unhappy inside.

80
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,375
[PROFESSOR] Very good.
And what did he

81
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,708
attribute this to, Gohan?

82
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,750
[ERASA] Huh?

83
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:16,000
Is anybody home?

84
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,791
So... hm, we have a slacker.

85
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,625
[GOHAN] Oh, my gosh!
I shouldn't have landed there.

86
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,166
That was so stupid!

87
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,625
I'll bet the whole
school's going to know

88
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,041
by the end of the day!

89
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,333
[PROFESSOR] Gohan!

90
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,416
Huh? Aaah! Sir! What?!

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,166
[CLASSMATES chuckling]

92
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,416
So this is the way you
want it to be, huh, Gohan?!

93
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,583
I was expecting more from you!

94
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:38,333
Sir! Yes, sir!

95
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,166
[VIDEL sneezes]

96
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,583
[PROFESSOR] Listen up, class!

97
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,291
I don't give lashes or
make you wear a dunce-cap!

98
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,958
But after you hold those water
buckets for fifteen minutes,

99
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,958
you're going to wish I did!

100
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,625
Do you feel your shoulders
burning, Mister Gohan?!

101
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,125
Oh. Yes, sir.

102
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,916
[PROFESSOR] Good! Now who
can tell us what Thoreau felt

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,166
was causing the
inner desperation that he

104
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,083
sensed in his peers?

105
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:03,208
What do you think, Miss Angela?

106
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,125
[ANGELA sighs]

107
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,750
Miss Angela...

108
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,625
Hmm...

109
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,541
Let's start
with an easier question.

110
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,208
Angela, do you know
where you are?

111
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,875
Uh-huh.

112
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,875
All right, then! Spit it out!

113
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,958
Uh... I'm sorry, Professor!
I don't know!

114
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know anything!

115
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,416
[PROFESSOR] Uh, Angela,
perhaps you should, uh,

116
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,791
visit the counselor.

117
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,625
[ANGELA] No! No!
I need to be punished!

118
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,750
[PROFESSOR] Very well.
You can listen to the lecture

119
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,333
through the window
with Mister Gohan!

120
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,625
Okay, sir!

121
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,958
[PROFESSOR] Huh....?

122
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,333
[CLASSMATES murmur]

123
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,333
[ANGELA] Thanks, Professor!

124
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,333
My word!

125
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,416
[ANGELA] Hi.

126
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,791
Hi! You, too?

127
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,416
Yeah! Gosh!
I was naughty, too!

128
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,041
Yep! Mmm.

129
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:56,000
Ooh.

130
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,250
[ANGELA giggles]

131
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,833
[chuckles nervously]

132
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,291
[GOHAN thinking]
Oh, man! This is just great!

133
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,875
What am I going to do now?

134
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,583
--[ANGELA] Gohan!
--[GOHAN] Huh?

135
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,166
Uh... yeah? What?

136
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,833
Nothing! But do you have
a steady girlfriend?

137
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,083
No. I don't.

138
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,958
Wonderful!
How 'bout dating me then?!

139
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, gosh! I... uh...

140
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,041
You think I'm ugly!
Don't you?!

141
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,166
Just say it!
You don't like me!

142
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,916
You think I'm ugly!

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,708
No! No! That's not true!

144
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,708
[ANGELA] Then why won't you go
out with me if it's not true?!

145
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,666
It's just...

146
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,958
If you don't go out with me,

147
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,875
I'll tell everyone your secret!

148
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,166
[GOHAN squeals] You wouldn't!

149
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,500
I sure would! Just try me!

150
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,416
Uh... Please don't!

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,583
[ANGELA] I don't understand!
Why won't you go out with me?

152
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:49,791
I thought we could start dating
and keep the secret between us!

153
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,250
But you don't like me!

154
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,750
That's not true!
Let's go out!

155
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,375
You really mean it?!

156
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,541
Yeah! [GOHAN chuckles]

157
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,083
Uh! Oh...

158
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,375
[ANGELA cheers, giggles]

159
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,583
Great! Great!
We are going to have a blast!

160
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,458
You just wait! Cool!

161
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,708
Eh...

162
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,875
Awesome! I'll see you
tomorrow then, okay?!

163
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,541
I'll meet you in front
of the train station

164
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,500
at one o'clock!

165
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,666
How did I get myself
into this predicament?!

166
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,833
Superheroes aren't
supposed to get blackmailed!

167
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,500
That just doesn't
happen that way.

168
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,000
What am I gonna do?

169
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,125
Maybe I should have Bulma
make me a different costume

170
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,125
and just call
myself something else!

171
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,000
How could I do this to myself?

172
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:36,083
I mean, I've never even
been on a date! This is crazy!

173
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,500
[CHICHI humming]

174
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:45,416
[door opens]

175
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,666
[GOHAN] Hey, Mom! I'm home!

176
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,625
[CHICHI] Hi, sweetheart!
How was your day?

I'll be right back!

349
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,875
[FIREMAN]
Please stay on the other

350
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,250
--[ANGELA] Okay!
--[FIREMAN] side of the barrier!

351
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,500
Errrgh! Come on, you!

352
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,166
[VIDEL] Come on,
you stubborn thing!

353
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,083
Whoa! This is it!

354
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,583
[CAPTIVES yelling]

355
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,708
[VIDEL] Oh, no you don't!

356
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,333
Where do you
think you're goin'? Huh?!

357
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,666
[VIDEL screams]

358
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,125
[GOHAN grunts]

359
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,166
[VIDEL] Huh?!

360
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,458
[GOHAN] Excuse me, miss!
Please clear out!

361
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,083
Huh?! You...

362
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,125
At your service!

363
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,041
[VIDEL] Saiyaman! There's
enough water in the tank

364
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,916
to put out the fire
but the release valve

365
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,333
can't let it all go in time!

366
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,875
Thank you.

367
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,208
[GOHAN] Stand back, everyone!

368
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:25,500
[CROWD murmuring, gasping]

369
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:40,000
[CROWD gasping]

370
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,250
Yeah!

371
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:54,375
[CROWD cheering]

372
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,500
All right! It's a miracle!

373
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,958
[MAN 3] Look! Up there!
It's that guy! Saiyaman!

374
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:05,791
[CROWD cheering]

375
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,500
[VIDEL thinking] Saiyaman, huh?

376
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,458
I'll find out
who you really are!

377
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,291
[FIRECHIEF] All right, folks!
The fun's over!

378
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,458
Please clear the area!

379
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,583
[FIREMAN 2] Send the ambulatory
units home, Sergeant!

380
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,375
We got lucky!

381
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,458
[SERGEANT] Yes, sir!

382
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,833
While I was opening the valve,

383
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,333
the roof started
collapsing--hm?!

384
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,541
Hold on one second.

385
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:37,208
[VIDEL] Where are
you going, Gohan?!

386
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:42,583
[GOHAN] Eh. Huh?

387
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,166
So what's the rush? Huh?!

388
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,541
Rush? I wasn't rushing!

389
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,125
[GOHAN chuckles nervously]

390
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,333
Gohan, you're hiding
something, aren't you?!

391
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:55,416
Uh. What d'ya mean?
Hiding what?!

392
00:19:58,041 --> 00:19:59,750
Uuh...

393
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,083
[ANGELA gasps]

394
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,791
No!

395
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:11,625
--[VIDEL] Huh?
--[GOHAN] Huh? Hey!

396
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,208
I've been looking for you!

397
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,583
You lied to me! Shame, shame!

398
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,708
[GOHAN] Huh?

399
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,458
You-You didn't have anything

400
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,000
that you needed
to take care of!

401
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,916
You saw Videl
and you wanted to sneak off

402
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and meet her
and give her a kiss!

403
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,583
[GOHAN]
Angela! That's not true!

404
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,125
And I really
liked you, Gohan!

405
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,041
I can't believe you would
embarrass me like this!

406
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,625
Videl, how would you like
to know a little secret

407
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,708
about Gohan that only I know?!

408
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,291
Sure, why not?

409
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,250
Aaah! Angela, no!

410
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,000
Look! See what
he's wearing?!

411
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,041
Mm-hmm.

412
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:45,125
[GOHAN screams]

413
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,125
He's hiding
something underneath!

414
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,000
Mm-hmm.

415
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,208
[GOHAN screams]

416
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,625
He's wearing
some underwear that

417
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,083
only a three-year old
would wear!

418
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,708
[GOHAN sceams]
[ANGELA screams]

419
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,541
Your secret. That's it?

420
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,833
No!

421
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,166
[ANGELA] Don't you
deny it, Gohan! I saw them!

422
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,583
It was the day
before yesterday, pal!

423
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:09,000
[GOHAN] Wait.
The day before yesterday?

424
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,125
[ANGELA] Yes! I was
on my way to gym class,

425
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,791
minding my own business,
when I noticed that

426
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,750
Gohan was still
in the locker room.

427
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,833
He was pulling up
his pants and I saw it.

428
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,583
[ANGELA] It was the cutest
teddy-bear I'd ever seen!

429
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:26,750
How adorable! Gosh!

430
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,833
Fess up! You wear
teddy-bear underwear!

431
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,750
That's my secret
that you've been keeping?

432
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,291
Until now!

433
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,458
What about when we
were both on the roof yesterday

434
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,250
right before our English class
was about to start?

435
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,291
Oh, that? Oh, no! Not then!

436
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,541
I couldn't have
seen your underwear then

437
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,500
because I didn't
have my contacts in.

438
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,375
Were your pants down?

439
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,208
[GOHAN yells]

440
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,000
I thought you were a nice boy!

441
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:53,666
Keep your pants on!
Or else! Got it?!

442
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,083
No! [laughs nervously]

443
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,583
That's not what I meant!

444
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,083
Of course I didn't have my
pants off on the roof yesterday!

445
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,458
Don't be silly, you two!

446
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:02,458
[ANGELA] I don't
like you anymore, Gohan!

447
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,041
Ooh.

448
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,416
[ANGELA] See if I ever
let you take me out again!

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,250
I feel so bad!

450
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,250
Angela really liked me
and somehow I managed

451
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,541
to hurt her feelings!

452
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,541
I'll bet I destroyed
her whole world! Man...

453
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,500
[GOHAN thinking]
I feel terrible!

454
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,708
I need to find her
and apologize!

455
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,625
Huh?

456
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,583
No way! That's my sign, too!

457
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:33,791
Wow! We have
alot in common then!

458
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,416
And what a physique!

459
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,583
The last guy I went out with
was nice but he was whimpy!

460
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,791
He even wore
teddy-bear underwear!

461
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:43,250
--[GUY] No way!
--[ANGELA] Yes!

462
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,083
[GOHAN chuckles nervously]

463
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,833
[NARRATOR] As another day
begins at Orange Star High,

464
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,791
the true identity of the Great
Saiyaman remains a mystery.

465
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,625
Next time on Dragon Ball Z!
