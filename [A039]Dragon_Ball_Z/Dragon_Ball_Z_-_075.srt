1
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,458
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,291
Goku mixed up
Captain Ginyu's plans

3
00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,416
to swap bodies with Vegeta.

4
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,208
[NARRATOR] As a result,
Goku got his body back.

5
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,000
[GINYU] What?

6
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,083
[NARRATOR] The beaten and
battered Captain Ginyu

7
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
wasn't ready to give up yet.

8
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,750
He knew he had one more chance
to switch bodies with Vegeta.

9
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,625
[NARRATOR] But as he tried,
Goku foiled his plans once more.

10
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,125
And as a result, Captain Ginyu
ended up in the body of a frog.

11
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,750
I've got my body back!

12
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,583
[NARRATOR] Battling had taken
it's toll on Goku's body,

13
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,125
and he was put into a
special recuperating capsule

14
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:13,666
by Krillin, Gohan, and Vegeta to
restore his Super Saiyan powers.

15
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,750
[NARRATOR] At the spaceship,

16
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,875
Vegeta showed signs that
something may be bothering him,

17
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,750
but what?

18
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,125
I might run into Frieza,

19
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,166
but I guess I'm gonna
have to take that chance.

20
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,041
Besides, Gohan, without
the correct password

21
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,958
we're never going to get our
wish from the Dragon Balls!

22
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,666
I'll go with you!

23
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,875
No, you stay here
and look after Goku.

24
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:36,333
[NARRATOR] As Goku recuperated,

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,125
Krillin left to try and get
the password from Guru.

26
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,666
Will Krillin return safely
with the Dragon Ball password

27
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,750
or does the evil Frieza
have other plans

28
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,250
for our heroic friends?

29
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,166
Find out today!

30
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,583
I sure hope this
new armor works.

31
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,666
I'll bet you almost anything,

32
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,666
Mom and Piccolo would
be surprised to see

33
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,583
me wearing a
Saiyan uniform!

34
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
[GOHAN chuckles]

35
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,125
You know, I really feel
indestructible in this!

36
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,000
Super Gohan!

37
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,708
Get ready to meet the universe's
most powerful Saiyan good guy!

38
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,250
What do you think you're doing?

39
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,000
So kid, what's taking
your bald-headed buddy

40
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,208
so long with that
stupid password?

41
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:55,166
Wait. He'll show.

42
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,625
[VEGETA] He'd better!

43
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,833
[VEGETA chuckles]

44
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:12,958
In the meantime, you
better keep your eyes

45
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,458
on those Dragon Balls,

46
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,958
'cause if we lose those, I'm
going to be totally pissed.

47
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:19,500
Well, I think it's
time for a little nap!

48
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:20,958
You're taking a nap?

49
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,333
[VEGETA] Well, with you
wearing that new armor,

50
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,875
I feel real safe!

51
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,291
[VEGETA laughs]

52
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,375
Gotta hurry. Not much time.

53
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:42,166
I just hope Goku and Gohan
are gonna be alright

54
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,625
with Vegeta back there!

55
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:47,833
And then there's Frieza.

56
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,458
If he ever discovered that
I was out here by myself,

57
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,500
then I would be a
goner for sure.

58
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,291
[KRILLIN] I can't waste a
second getting to Guru's!

59
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,291
I just hope I can get
to Krillin and the others

60
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,333
in time to tell them
what the password is.

61
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,958
I found them!

62
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:24,791
[DENDE] Oh no, there's
something fishy here...

63
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,250
There's no sign of them!

64
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,125
Yaah!

65
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,500
Oh no! Krillin!

66
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,708
[DENDE] No, it can't beee!

67
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:46,125
Krillin! Nooo!

68
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,250
Huh? This isn't Krillin!

69
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:04,583
This is strange! What
could've happened here?

70
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,583
[VEGETA] Get well, Kakarot.

71
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,875
You'll need your strength
to defend against Frieza.

72
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,916
And later to
defend against me...

73
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:47,750
[VEGETA grunts]

74
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,041
I think I overdid it
a little bit...

75
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,166
I figure it should only
take about a half an hour

76
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,458
to get my strength back...

77
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:13,916
Let's see...

78
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,583
[VEGETA] A Super Saiyan
does need his rest...

79
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:35,541
[VEGETA] I can hardly wait until
the Dragon grants my wish!

80
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,458
[GOHAN] I can't believe
he left me here by myself.

81
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,583
What if Frieza shows up?

82
00:08:53,375 --> 00:09:05,708
[NAIL pants]

83
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:18,625
[FRIEZA] I must say, Nail,
you are one pathetic warrior.

84
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,625
Do you really think you
stand a chance against me?

85
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,208
[FRIEZA] Might I
suggest you give up now

86
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,291
while you're still breathing
and simply tell me the password?

87
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,791
Hmmm...?

88
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,625
[FRIEZA] Oh well, suit yourself.

89
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,583
[NAIL] Haaah!

90
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,916
Wha--?!

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,166
You really are starting
to bore me, my dear friend.

92
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,250
[NAIL gasps]

93
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,791
[NAIL growls]

94
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:06,000
[FRIEZA] As you well know by
now, you can never defeat me.

95
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:10,041
So my question is:
Why are you still trying?

96
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,791
And if you don't tell me,

97
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,625
maybe I'll just have
to beat it out of Guru.

98
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,291
Is that what you want?

99
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,083
It doesn't make
any difference to me.

100
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:23,583
One way or another,
I will get that password!

101
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,791
[NAIL gasps]

102
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,291
Huh--?

103
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,375
[NAIL groans]

104
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,791
[FRIEZA] So, just to
set the ground rules,

105
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,625
that was my last warning.

106
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,916
Either you divulge what I want,
or you will never get up again!

107
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,041
You truly are pathetic!

108
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:51,125
[NAIL chuckles]

109
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:55,333
You know, I think it's time I
let you in on a little secret.

110
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,791
Huh?

111
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,916
[NAIL] Our little
diversion worked perfectly.

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
[NAIL chuckles]

113
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,750
Yep. By now, Dende
has given the password

114
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,250
to the people from Earth!

115
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,291
What?! I don't... Ah!

116
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,291
Mark my words, I'm not
finished with you yet!

117
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,666
[NAIL chuckles]

118
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,958
Ginyu Force, this is
Frieza, come in, over!

119
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:31,375
What?! No!

120
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,708
This can't be!
Where are my soldiers?!

121
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,000
Why aren't they showing
up on my scouter?!

122
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,208
There's no way Vegeta and
those miserable little punks

123
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,500
could take down the
entire Ginyu force!

124
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,125
If they're sleeping on the
job, I will make them pay!

125
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,833
Idiots! They better not
have let those imbeciles

126
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,291
near the Dragon Balls!

127
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,708
Because the only one allowed
to make a wish is Frieza!

128
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,791
[GURU] Oh, it's all my fault...

129
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,375
I should have given the password
to Krillin and his friend

130
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,166
when they were here...

131
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,250
And now I feel so bad for
putting Nail through all that.

132
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,666
If only I had known!

133
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,791
[GURU coughs]

134
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,416
Please! Please, Dende!
You must hurry!

135
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,833
I don't have much time left

136
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,875
and I know Frieza
is right behind you.

137
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,416
Where are you?!

138
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,125
[DENDE] Krillin! Gohan!
Where are you?!

139
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,541
Man, I wonder when Krillin's
coming back. I hope he's okay.

140
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,750
It shouldn't have taken
him nearly this much time

141
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,875
just to fly over to
Guru's and back.

142
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,458
Yeah, I sure hope he
at least gets back here

143
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,291
before Frieza shows up.

144
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,041
[GOHAN] Well, I shouldn't
worry too much,

145
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:35,708
because with this
cool fighting suit,

146
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:39,166
I could probably hold of
Frieza for a while by myself.

147
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,583
I mean, I think I could...

148
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,583
[FRIEZA growls]

149
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,958
Huh? What?

150
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,500
I've gotta a funny
feeling I'm not alone.

151
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,166
[KRILLIN] I better
check this out!

152
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,500
[KRILLIN] Wait a second!
That's Dende!

153
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:23,458
Hey!

154
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,916
Huh?

155
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:27,500
[DENDE screams]

156
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,000
[KRILLIN laughs]

157
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:32,166
It's only me, Krillin! I'm just
wearing a Saiyan uniform!

158
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,041
Ah! It is you, Krillin!

159
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,250
--What a relief!
--What a relief!

160
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,458
[GINYU grunting]

161
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,916
[GINYU screams]

162
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:08,250
[GINYU grunting]

163
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,125
[grunting continues]

164
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:15,666
Huh...?

165
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,208
Ribbit! Ri-Ribbit!

166
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,250
[GINYU chuckles]

167
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,625
A frog? Hmm...

168
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:33,250
[GINYU whistles]

169
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,416
Hold on...

170
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,583
Hey, I know who you are!

171
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,625
You're the frog that
took over my dad's body

172
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,458
and then tried to do
away with him, aren't you?

173
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,541
Ribbit! Ribibibi!

174
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:51,833
[GINYU chuckles]

175
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,458
Uh, ribbit? Ribbit.

176
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,500
[GOHAN chuckles]

177
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,166
Now say good night, Froggy!

178
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,208
[GINYU] Woah-ho-ho!

179
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,666
[GINYU grunting]

180
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,750
[GOHAN laughs]

181
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,791
You can hop, but you can't hide!

182
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,500
[GOHAN laughs]

183
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,166
[FEMALE FROG]
Ribbit... ribbit...

184
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Ribbit... Ribbit...

185
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:21,041
[GINYU whimpers]

186
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:33,875
[KRILLIN laughs]

187
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,375
Man, is it good to see you!

188
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,166
And your timing couldn't
have been any better

189
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,708
because we've managed to
find all seven Dragon Balls!

190
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,500
But the problem we're having is
that we don't know the password

191
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,333
and so we can't make our wish.

192
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,125
That's exactly what Guru said.
That's why he sent me

193
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,583
to find you guys so I
could tell you the password

194
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,166
and you could make your wish!

195
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,416
That's great! So, you
gonna tell me what it is?

196
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
It's in Namek,

197
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,208
and you probably
wouldn't understand it

198
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,916
even if I told it to you.

199
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,458
In Namek, huh?
Well, I gotta tell ya,

200
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:03,458
if Guru had told us that
when we were there,

201
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,166
he sure would have saved
us all a lotta trouble!

202
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,000
[DENDE] At the time, Guru didn't
think you'd be able to collect

203
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,625
all seven Dragon Balls.

204
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,875
Well, that explains it...

205
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,125
[DENDE] Hey, we'd better
step on it, Krillin!

206
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,500
I mean, if we don't,
Frieza might show up.

207
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,625
before we even get a
chance to use the password!

208
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,250
Right! Let's get moving.

209
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,375
Huh? I think someone's coming!

210
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:37,291
[GOHAN] Maybe it's Krillin!
Man, I sure hope so!

211
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:48,916
I can sense them, but I
can't make out who they are!

212
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,375
It is Krillin! All right!

213
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,875
[KRILLIN] Look, it's Gohan!

214
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,375
[DENDE] And he's alright!

215
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:02,958
[GOHAN laughs]

216
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,000
[BOTH laughing]

217
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,208
Krillin! I'm so happy
you made it back okay!

218
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,208
[KRILLIN] What? You didn't
think I could do it?

219
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, and you do remember
this guy, don't you?

220
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,041
[GOHAN] Of course. Do you happen
to know the password, Dende?

221
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,416
Yes!

222
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
Hey, why isn't Vegeta here?

223
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,625
Wasn't he supposed to be helping
you protect the Dragon Balls?

224
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,791
Where is he?!

225
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,541
[GOHAN] Oh, yeah. Vegeta...

226
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,541
He went inside the ship and
said he was going to take a nap.

227
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,666
But that was almost an hour ago.

228
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,875
Ahhh, this is perfect.

229
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,333
All we have to do now is
gather up the Dragon Balls,

230
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,666
but we gotta be quiet because
we don't wanna wake up Vegeta!

231
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,500
Then we bring the
Balls to this side,

232
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,083
so if Vegeta does wake up, it'll
take him time to get to us.

233
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,708
--[GOHAN] Right.
--[DENDE] Right.

234
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,458
[KRILLIN] Good! Let's go!

235
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,541
[KRILLIN] Yeah! We did it!

236
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:15,666
Phew...

237
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,125
We're all counting
on you, Dende!

238
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,041
Yes!

239
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:22,333
[FRIEZA growling]

240
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,708
[GOHAN gasps]

241
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,125
[KRILLIN laughs]

242
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,333
Hey! Quiet, Krillin! I think
I sense someone coming!

243
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,875
And he's closing in fast!

244
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,333
[DENDE &amp; KRILLIN gasp]

245
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,458
Ah, i-it's Frieza!

246
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,625
Dende, you had better
use that password now

247
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,083
before it's too late!

248
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,416
Takkarapt pop
porunga pupiritparo!

249
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,833
Are you sure that's
the right password?

250
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,875
Um, Dende? I thought you
said you knew what it was.

251
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,708
[GOHAN &amp; KRILLIN gasp]

252
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,583
They're glowing!

253
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,000
Krillin, look at the sky!

254
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,333
Yeah, I think that means
they're working now.

255
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,666
What's happening?! Why has
the sky turned so dark?

256
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:04,041
[ALL grunting]

257
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,250
[KING KAI] Do you feel it?!

258
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,000
Finally, their wish
will come true!

259
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:18,333
[CHIAOTZU] Yay, alright!
They did it! Yippee!

260
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,875
[CHIATZU laughs]

261
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,958
Isn't this exciting, Tien?

262
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,541
[KRILLIN whimpers]

263
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,416
[GOHAN whimpers]

264
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,416
[DENDE whimpers]

265
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,208
[ALL whimpering]

266
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,708
Oh, man... He's... He's huge!

267
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:45,291
Bigger than anything I've
ever seen in my whole life!

268
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,208
Are you sure this
is the Dragon?

269
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,750
[DENDE] Yes, Gohan.

270
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:54,250
His name is Porunga and in
Namek it means "Dragon of Love."

271
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,458
But to be honest,
this is the first time

272
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,083
I've ever had a
chance to see him!

273
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:02,750
You have collected
all seven Dragon Balls.

274
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,333
And now as it is written,

275
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:10,625
think wisely and I will
grant you three wishes

276
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:12,541
within my power!

277
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:15,875
Wait, three? Did say
three wishes, Dende?

278
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:20,041
That's right. Now, please,
hurry and make your wishes!

279
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,500
Oh yeah! Did you
hear that Gohan?

280
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:24,625
We get to make two extra wishes!

281
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,625
That's awesome! So what do
you think we should wish for?

282
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,708
[NARRATOR] The Dragon
has been summoned!

283
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:35,333
And our heroes now have
three wishes to make.

284
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:39,250
But what will those
wishes be used for?

285
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,875
Will our heroes accomplish
what they set out to do?

286
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:49,458
Will Vegeta or Frieza arrive in
time to change their plans?

287
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:55,208
Find out on the next exciting
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
