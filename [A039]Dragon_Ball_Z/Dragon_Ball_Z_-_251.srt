1
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,083
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,000
Gohan mastered the Z Sword

3
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,208
and it was time to put the
legendary blade to the test.

4
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,791
[GOKU]
Here it comes!

5
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,583
[NARRATOR]
And who better than Goku

6
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:26,458
to deliver a solid
block of Katchin Ore,

7
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,916
the hardest known
metal in the Universe.

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,625
[NARRATOR] But tragedy
struck and the Z Sword

9
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,208
wasn't able to bear
the strain of being handled

10
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,833
by the mighty
father-son duo.

11
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,208
[NARRATOR]
Impossible but true!

12
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,458
The greatest sword ever
made was in pieces.

13
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,166
[NARRATOR] But mystically
emanating from the sword,

14
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,583
after being trapped inside
of it for untold centuries

15
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:55,166
was Old Kai, an ancient
ancestor of Supreme Kai,

16
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,250
who claimed to have
the ability to awaken

17
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,583
a person's sleeping powers.

18
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,583
Right!

19
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,083
[OLD KAI mumbles nonsensically]

20
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,791
[NARRATOR]
And, with gusto,

21
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,291
he set out to do
just that for Gohan.

22
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,083
But will it really work?

23
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,791
Meanwhile, Trunks and
Goten had finally mastered

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,875
the form for the
Fusion Technique

25
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:17,750
and they were ready to turn
the concept into reality.

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,333
[MARON giggles]

27
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,166
[OOLONG]
Stop trying to psyche me out!

28
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,666
[ROSHI]
Just pick!

29
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,791
--[OOLONG grunts]
--[ROSHI chuckles]

30
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:35,958
[OOLONG]
You're using some of that

31
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,750
mystical master stuff
on me, aren't you?

32
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,125
[BULMA]
She's so cute!

33
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,125
[YAMCHA]
Hey, guys.

34
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,958
[ROSHI]
Hmm?

35
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,833
[VIDEL]
What's up, Yamcha?

36
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,541
Well, it's fusion time.

37
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,416
Trunks and Goten have
mastered the form.

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,208
So the boys are ready
to give it a try, huh?

39
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,125
[KRILLIN] Cool!
I say we all go watch.

40
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,125
[BULMA] Yeah, this should
be interesting.

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,500
[MARON] Are Trunks
and Goten one boy, Mommy?

42
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,416
[ANDROID 18]
Not yet, sweetheart.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,916
So, ah, if you could
fuse together with somebody

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
and it could be anyone in
the world, who would it be?

45
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,333
I mean, hypothetically.

46
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,666
Gosh, that's a tough one,

47
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,083
but I think I'd pick your
old girlfriend Maron!

48
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
[laughs]

49
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,166
Right on! Bald and
beautiful! So deadly!

50
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,666
Oh, dear!

51
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,500
What are we going to call our
newly combined son, Bulma?

52
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,833
Huh?

53
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,708
Let's see. Goten and Trunks.
What about Trunkten?

54
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,125
Hm. That's weird.

55
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,791
Maybe something like
Gotrunks would be better.

56
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,291
Hey! Why are you
racking your brain?

57
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,375
The fusion's only temporary.

58
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,958
It only lasts about
thirty minutes or so.

59
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:48,833
True. But still,
a name would be nice.

60
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,250
This oughta be good.

61
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:09,750
[GOTEN grunts]

62
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:15,166
[TRUNKS grunts]

63
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,458
[BOTH grunt lightly]

64
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey, Trunks.
Hold your power back a bit.

65
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,250
I can try. There.

66
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:31,041
Yes. That's perfect. Your
levels are exactly the same.

67
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,791
Okay. Whenever you're ready.

68
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,833
[BOTH]
Hm!

69
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,500
This is it.

70
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:50,750
Hm?

71
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,208
Mm!

72
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,750
Fuuuu...sion!

73
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,958
Haaa!

--[BULMA gasps]
--[CHICHI] Aaah!

[KRILLIN exhales quaveringly]

77
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,625
[VIDEL]
This is intense!

[GROUP screams]

79
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:18,916
[PUAR screams]

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,416
Haa... Mmm...

ChiChi!

[KRILLIN]
Mm? Uuh!

84
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,416
[PICCOLO]
Uuh?!

85
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,541
[KRILLIN] Is he supposed
to look like that?

86
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,416
[YAMCHA]
I, uh, guess so.

87
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,916
Wow! He's certainly
well equipped, isn't he?

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,791
Yeah! That's a
nice way to put it!

89
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,333
Hey! I think I get it!

90
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,916
He's supposed to
look like that!

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,958
He's built like Majin Buu!

92
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:06,208
[groans]

93
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,458
[KRILLIN] A roly-poly body
must help to regulate

94
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,041
the enormous power
at that level.

95
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,166
That's why Buu has one.

96
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,208
No doubt! Yeah!
Dig it! Check him out!

97
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,250
You've got
the moves, baby! Yeah!

98
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,875
[laughs]
All right!

99
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,166
This is so bizarre!

100
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,041
[groaning]

101
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:33,500
[YAMCHA] Oh, yeah!
Speed test! Here we go!

102
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:43,125
[breathing heavily]

103
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,750
Huh?

104
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:52,750
[panting, wheezing]

105
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,750
[PICCOLO] I think I know
what the problem is.

106
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:55,708
Huh?

107
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,458
Yeah. We goofed.

108
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,833
Um... Uh...

109
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:04,666
It's the form. Trunks made
a slight error. He did this.

110
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,666
But he shouldn't have
fully extended his fingers.

111
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,625
He should've done this.

112
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,625
All right! Got it?

113
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,791
Uh...

114
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,333
[PICCOLO] Good!
Now go ahead and separate

115
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,875
so we can get it right.

116
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, what are you waiting for?
You heard me. Separate!

117
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,250
Ummm. But, I don't know how.

118
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:30,125
Huh? Oh, right. I see.

119
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,541
Hmmm.

120
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:35,500
Uh, well, Goku never
showed us that part.

121
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,000
I guess we don't have a choice.

122
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,791
We'll just have to wait until
the thirty minutes are up.

123
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,041
[KRILIN]
Strange, but you're neither

124

Trunks or Goten, are you?

125
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,916

your own set of clothes.

feel like being one person?

Do you have a name?

131
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,916
Wow! See, he does
have his own name.

Look. I'm hungry.

133

I just want to eat
and take a nap.

like Yajirobe, Daddy!

I don't know!

Yes! Bravo! Well done!

time for idle talk, you two.

to accomplish. Got it?

or something!

There'll be no beefing up.

We're going to wait thirty
minutes and try it again.

going to get it right!

Trunks a little bit.

178
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,208
Whatd'ya think, ChiChi?

179
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,916
The nose, yes. The eyes, no.

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,666
He's got fabulous energy.

181
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,833
Does it matter
who he looks like?

182
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,916
But he does have Goten's hair.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,666
[PICCOLO] Excellent!
Thirty minutes from now

184
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,333
we'll try the fusion again.

185
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,125
Only this time
you'll be Super Saiyans.

186
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:21,125
Uh, uh, ah! We're not doing
this as Super Saiyans.

187
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,541
What?!

188
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,875
There's no need for it.
We're strong enough as it is.

189
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,416
You little! How dare you!
This is a team effort, got it?

190
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,666
That's a call that
we all have to agree on,

191
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,208
and I don't agree!

192
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,375
It makes no sense to
confront Buu unless you're

193
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:38,750
at your absolute maximum.
Understand me?

194
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:39,916
Huh?

195
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,083
Yes. But you don't.

196
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,625
Look. You're scared.
But Buu is nothing.

197
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,583
I will bring him back. Dead!

198
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,125
Uh?

199
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,291
[GOTENKS]
See ya!

200
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,250
Wait! No! Come back!

201
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,250
[GOTENKS]
Don't have a heart attack!

202
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,000
[MR. POPO]
He's not listening!

203
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,458
Oh, good! He's close!

204
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,958
Thirty minutes should be
plenty of time. All right.

205
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,000
This is gonna be fun.

206

207
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,291
Now that's fast. Whoa.

208
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,708
[PICCOLO] Darn it!
If he gets killed now,

209
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,208
all of our efforts
were for nothing.

210
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,125
Yeah. You're right.
He's reckless for sure.

211
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,625
But I wouldn't be
the least bit surprised

212
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,416
if he beat Majin Buu.

213
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,125
Me either. I betcha that
little guy tears Buu up.

214
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,083
[PICCOLO] If we're lucky.
But what if he doesn't?

Welcome back! Nice sleep?

221
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,458
Yeah. It seemed short though.

222
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,291
[SUPREME KAI] Yes. You were
only out for two hours.

223
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,375
Oh! That's right!
How's Gohan?

224
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,833
Are his sleeping
powers awake yet?

That's weird.

228
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:39,625
Yes, Goku. I think
I know what you mean.

229
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:44,000
And we've still got three hours
to go before the ceremony ends.

Hey. Son. Do your best!

bring Buu back dead.

Then I go and
blow him to pieces.

gonna handle this one?

awaken Gohan's latent powers?

The question really is,

346
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,875
can Gohan wait another
thirty hours to find out?

347
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,125
And after being beaten
roundly by Majin Buu,

348
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,041
can Gotenks
rebound and conquer
