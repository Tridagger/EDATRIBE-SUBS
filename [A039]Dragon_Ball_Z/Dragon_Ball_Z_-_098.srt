1
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,375
Frieza set his destructive
sights on Planet Namek itself!

3
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,541
[FRIEZA] Die, planet! Die!

4
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,833
[NARRATOR] It was a strategy
born of desperation...

5
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,125
Overwhelmed by
Goku's new power,

6
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,125
Frieza was attempting
to destroy Goku

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:33,500
by taking away the very
air that he breathed.

8
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:41,833
[NARRATOR] Miraculously,
Planet Namek didn't explode,

9
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,541
but it was only
hanging on by a thread,

10
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:48,458
due to blow up in just
five short minutes.

11
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,791
[GOKU] Five minutes
is all that I need.

12
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,916
It won't even take me
that long to beat you

13
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,833
and leave with my
friends on my spaceship.

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,083
You underestimate me.

15
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,708
The true depth of
my power escapes you.

16
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,041
Well, it's time you experience
the ultimate Frieza!

17
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,250
[GOKU growls]

18
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,333
This battle
ends right now!

19
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,708
[GOKU yells]

20
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,583
[yelling continues]

21
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:33,208
[FRIEZA yells]

22
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,583
[GOKU yells]

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,625
[GOKU growls]

24
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,208
[FRIEZA screams]

25
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,625
[FRIEZA yells]

26
00:03:58,541 --> 00:03:59,916
[GOKU grunts]

27
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:03,833
[GOKU] Hey, yo!

28
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,291
What's the matter?

29
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,833
You're the one who started
this battle, remember?

30
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,958
[GOKU growls]

31
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,500
[FRIEZA screams]

32
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,583
[FRIEZA growls]

33
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,791
[GOKU yells]

34
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,250
[FRIEZA growls]

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,041
Huh...?

36
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:34,416
[FRIEZA yells]

37
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,875
[GOKU grunts]

38
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,625
[FRIEZA] Well, well,
well, look who's back.

39
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,375
I didn't think that I'd
get rid of you that easily.

40
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:39,083
But that little break in the
action is all I really needed.

41
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,166
[FRIEZA chuckles]

42
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,291
[FRIEZA] While you were
down there spelunking,

43
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,500
I was gathering
precious energies.

44
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,666
[FRIEZA laughs]

45
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,666
[FRIEZA] I'm just moments
away from achieving

46
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,541
my maximum right now.

47
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,166
Aren't you curious?

48
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,791
You're a Saiyan, right?

49
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,583
Then, no doubt, you must be
burning to see my true power!

50
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,250
Well, watch and see.

51
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,708
[GOKU growls]

52
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,583
[thinking] Excellent.

53
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,958
Like a typical Saiyan,
he's going for the bait.

54
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,083
This victory is
going to be mine!

55
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,041
Ugh... This is crazy!

56
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,791
I don't know what's holding
this planet together anymore!

57
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,916
Bulma...

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,166
Where are you...?

59
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,666
I should be able to
sense your presence

60
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,541
but for some reason, I can't...

61
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,250
[GOHAN] Dad, I can't
leave you in this place!

62
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,250
This whole thing
could blow any second!

63
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,791
We're going to have to make
it out of here together!

64
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,625
[BULMA] Oh, no!

65
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,666
I'm stuck!

66
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,208
I-I can't move, I'm frozen!

67
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,750
Somebody help me!

68
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,958
Those rotten skunks!
This is it!

69
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,291
I'm one ticked-off
damsel in distress!

70
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,166
[BULMA gasps]

71
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,583
[BULMA screams]

72
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,916
Yikes!

73
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,583
Oh no! Help me!

74
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:43,291
[FRIEZA growls]

75
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,583
[GOKU] Huh?!

76
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:55,958
[growling continues]

77
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,708
[GOKU] Woah...

78
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,458
He's actually reaching the
true pinnacle of his power!

79
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:13,708
[FRIEZA growls]

80
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:23,416
[FRIEZA growls]

81
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,333
[GOKU] I sense his desperation.

82
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,000
He's scared that I'm going
to attack before he finishes.

83
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,041
[FRIEZA yells]

84
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,500
[thinking] Just a
little bit longer...

85
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,500
Yes...

86
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,458
Yes!

87
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,500
[KING KAI] Goku?

88
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,000
This is King Kai.

89
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,875
Can you hear me?

90
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:45,791
Goku?!

91
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,041
Please answer me!

92
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,000
This is King Kai calling!

93
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:53,750
Now, look!

94
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,416
I know you can hear me, Goku!

95
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,083
You're just like all the others!

96
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,875
You learn what
I have to teach you

97
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,041
and then you forget
about the teacher!

98
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,208
If you don't
answer me,

99
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,125
I'm going to start
telling jokes!

100
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,208
And I've got a million of them!

101
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,166
Okay then, here goes:

102
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,166
What did the penguin
say to the astronaut?

103
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,833
[GOKU] Alright, alright!

104
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,750
I'm here, King Kai!

105
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,125
What is it?

106
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,750
[KING KAI] Goku, why aren't
you attacking Frieza?!

107
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,291
He's about to reach his maximum!

108
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,250
This could be your last chance!

109
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,250
[GOKU] I want him
to reach his maximum!

110
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,333
I want to fight him
when he's at his best!

111
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,916
What?! That's crazy!

112
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,125
[KING KAI] Goku!

113
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,958
Is it possible
that your new power

114
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,583
has altered your judgement?

115
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,416
Think about it!

116
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,958
[thinking] My true
power is close...

117
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,250
Yes! I can feel it!

118
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,750
[KING KAI] Goku, I want you
to know that I'm here for you.

119
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,083
If you need to talk...

120
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,916
I'm fine!

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,041
For some reason,
this is the way I want it!

122
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:06,750
[FRIEZA growls]

123
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,000
[KING KAI] Goku,
please! Attack now!

124
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,458
No!

125
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:23,083
[FRIEZA yells]

126
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,750
[GOKU growls]

127
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,083
I will not forget

128
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,875
what you did to my
best friend, Frieza!

129
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,416
You took from him what no one
has the right to take: Life!

130
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,291
[GOHAN] Krillin! No!

131
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,666
[GOKU] I won't let your
sacrifice be in vain, Krillin!

132
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,250
I can still see the
look on your face...

133
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,708
Help me! Aah--!

134
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,625
[GOKU] He had no right...

135
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:57,000
[KING KAI] I understand
how you feel, Goku!

136
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,083
But how is letting Frieza
achieve his maximum

137
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,500
going to help?!

138
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,958
[GOKU] If I face him now,
at his best, and beat him,

139
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,208
he'll never come back
to haunt us again!

140
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,708
It will be over for good!

141
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,208
[KING KAI] But it's
too risky, Goku!

142
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,916
What if you lose?

143
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,250
I won't lose! I can't lose!

144
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,250
[KING KAI] But what about
Gohan? And Piccolo?!

145
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:19,791
If Piccolo doesn't make it

146
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,750
then the others can't be wished
back with the Dragon Balls!

147
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,250
They'll survive!

148
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,500
I know that!

149
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,958
Somehow...

150
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,958
[FRIEZA giggles]

151
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,166
Oh, man!

152
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,625
Bulma! Where are you?

153
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,166
[BULMA] Help!

154
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,750
[BULMA screams]

155
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,583
Please, I don't want to die!

156
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,708
[BULMA screams]

157
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,333
[BULMA screams]

158
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:25,916
[BULMA gasps]

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,375
[BULMA screams]

160
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,375
[BULMA] Oh, no!

161
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,500
This is really it!

162
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,958
I can't believe it!

163
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,166
[BULMA sighs]

164
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:43,666
[BULMA screams]

165
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,958
Hey, thanks! Wow!

166
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,541
But, hey, what took you
so long, you big jerk!

167
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,750
And you could
have left yourself

168
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,666
more than one second
to spare, you know?!

169
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,208
This is my life that
we're talking about here!

170
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,875
Hello? Wake-up call?! 

171
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,875
Where are Goku
and Krillin anyway?!

172
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,000
Those scoundrels!

173
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,666
Can we talk about
this later, Bulma?!

174
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,750
This whole planet
is about to blow!

175
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,458
Yeah, things are
a little unstable here

176
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:13,875
to say the least...

177
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,708
But we're going
home, aren't we?

178
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:18,291
Oh, my gosh! I can't believe
it! We're actually going home!

179
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,375
Yay!

180
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,625
I hope so...

181
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,666
All right!

182
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,375
[CHICHI] Gohan, this is mommy...

183
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,125
Gohan, why won't
you answer me...?

184
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,791
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

185
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,458
You're not grounded. Please...

186
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,958
Just say something, anything...

187
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,458
[CHICHI] Oh, no!
This is terrible!

188
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,250
What in the world
is going on up there?!

189
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,500
[DR. BRIEF] There are
only three things

190
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,833
that could cause this
transmission to fail.

191
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:55,250
One: the darn thing's broke.

192
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,666
Uh... Two: the whole ship
has been destroyed somehow.

193
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,416
And then there's three:

194
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,833
Interference from a series
electro-magnetic waves.

195
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,583
Which means the planet's axis,

196
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:09,375
it's being stretched
or compressed.

197
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,541
Goodness!

198
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:13,166
What does it mean when
the axis distorts?

199
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,000
Mmmm...

200
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,208
Uh, well, it means... Hmm...

201
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,666
Well, a sudden
change like that

202
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,000
could mean only one thing:

203
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:27,875
I'm afraid that the planet's
core has become unstable.

204
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,416
It's... um... gonna... blow...

205
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,583
--[CHICHI gasps]
--[ROSHI] Wha--?!

206
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,833
[FRIEZA growls]

207
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,208
C'mon! Just a bit more!

208
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,666
Almost there!

209
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,500
Frieza, let's do this
while we're still young.

210
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,458
I will let you reach your
maximum so there's no doubt

211
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:14,333
who the strongest
was when this is over!

212
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,791
I could have already
beaten you by now!

213
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,083
But when you lose, I want
you to know for certain

214
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,166
that you gave it
everything that you had!

215
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,041
That even at its fullest, your
power was no match for mine!

216
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,708
[FRIEZA] Alright, big guy.

217
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,375
Whatever turns you on.

218
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:35,666
[FRIEZA giggles]

219
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,208
[YAMCHA] King Kai!
What's the matter?!

220
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,208
When I was young,
I did what my master told me!

221
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:45,208
I don't understand this
thick-headed generation!

222
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,416

225
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,208
Bingo!

226
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,583
Ahh, that feels so
good. I'd forgotten.

227
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,416
Now, time to squash
you like a bug!

228
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
All that waiting and this
is how you thank me?

229
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,041
[KING KAI laughs]

230
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,541
[KING KAI] Oh my!

231
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,000
Maybe he hasn't
lost it after all!

Huh?! Unbelievable!

243
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,916
This has never happened before!

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,791
They're moving so fast that even
I can't follow their motions!

245
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,708
Huh?

What the--?!

251
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,500
[GOKU] I can't even sense him!

252
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,958
Darn!

253
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,583

[FRIEZA] Why, you...!

275
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:10,125
[FRIEZA] You'll be much more
impressed when you're dead!

276
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,250

One shot and he's
throwing in the towel.

closer to destruction.

to beat Frieza

296

the explosion?
