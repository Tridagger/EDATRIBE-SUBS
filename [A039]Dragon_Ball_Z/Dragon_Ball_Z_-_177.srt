00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,375
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,250
the misfit cavalry arrived!

3
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:18,125
Leaping from their
bedazzled pink helicopter,

4
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,125
Mr. Satan's top two students
entered the Cell Games

5
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,208
to fight in their
master's place.

6
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,375
First came the graceful

7
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,166
and self-proclaimed
ladies' man Caroni.

8
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,041
He launched into the
air with his signature

9
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,958
"Beautiful Flying Rose Attack."

10
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:33,500
And with a little
boost from Cell's energy,

11
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:37,791
it was indeed a finishing
move... for Caroni.

12
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,541
[CARONI whimpers]

13
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,666
[NARRATOR] Next was
muscle-man Pirozhki,

14
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,375
who charged Cell with his prized
move, the Megaton Bull Crusher!

15
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,166
[NARRATOR] But without
lifting a finger,

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,916
Cell bowled over
the bulbous fighter

17
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
with a mere exertion
of his energy!

18
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,416
[PIROZHKI grunting]

19
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,416
[NARRATOR] That's two for Cell,
none for planet Earth!

20
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,375
[PIROZHKI groans]

21
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,458
[NARRATOR] Annoyed by
his students' slip-ups,

22
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,333
Mr. Satan stepped in
to settle the score.

23
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,208
It was time for the
World Champion of Martial Arts

24
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,541
to show his stuff.

25
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,333
[MR. SATAN grunting]

26
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,916
[MR. SATAN yells]

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,375
[screaming]

28
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,875
[NARRATOR] With Mr. Satan's
mouth finally shut,

29
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:36,875
Cell could actually begin
the tournament he'd intended.

30
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:38,416
[CELL] Let's get this
tournament underway.

31
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,958
Who will be first?

32
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,375
Will it be Goku
to start things off?

33
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,041
[NARRATOR] Goku, who had been
anxiously waiting for his chance

34
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,250
to square off with Cell, had
only one thing to say:

35
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,791
[GOKU] Let's do it.

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,250
[NARRATOR] At last,
the main event has come!

37
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,458
In one corner,
the biological android

38
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,416
created only to destroy.

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,666
And in the other, the greatest
hero the Earth has ever known.

40
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,500
The fight begins... today!

41
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,791
L-Ladies and gentlemen,

42
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,708
our last hope rested upon
the shoulder's of Mr. Satan.

43
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:15,750
But now that he's lost, does
this mean... we're all doomed?

44
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:18,166
This should be good.

45
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,625
Yeah...

46
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,958
[VEGETA thinking] All right,
Kakarot...

47
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,875
It's time to see
what you can do!

48
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,666
[CELL] As I'm sure
you know by now,

49
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,916
I've been waiting for this!

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,875
Killing the helpless
quickly grows old.

51
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,458
[CELL chuckles softly]

52
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:09,416
[CELL] I'm counting on you for
amusement while I test my body.

53
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
I hear you're designed to use

54
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,875
all of our techniques
against us.

55
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,375
Perfection.

56
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,916
[MR. SATAN groans]

57
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
[ANNOUNCER] Hmm?

58
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:28,458
What? Mr. Satan!

59
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:30,458
[groaning continues]

60
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,541
May I ask what happened
with you there in the ring?

61
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,250
Hey, it's no big deal!

62
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,166
I just lost my footing!

63
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,708
You... lost your... footing?

64
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,416
[MR. SATAN] Yes, I did!

65
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,125
But it looked... like you
were launched from the ring!

66
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,916
Sure, it looked that
way to an untrained eye!

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,250
But you're forgetting
Hercule's strength!

68
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,666
I mean, when your
big bulging muscles

69
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,791
can make tin foil
out of a tour bus,

70
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,958
the smallest slip will
send you flying for miles!

71
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,291
Huh? Is that a fact?

72
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,666
[BOTH] It is fact!

73
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,791
O-kay...

74
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,291
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

75
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,583
Don't worry!

76
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,625
Once I take a short break
to re-lace my boots,

77
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,458
I'll get back in there
and squash that wimp!

78
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,875
Now who rules?!

79
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:20,541
[PIROZHKI &amp; CARONI]
Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!

80
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,208
That ridiculous man
hasn't realized his weakness!

81
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,250
His stupidity's beyond belief!

82
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,375
[HERCULE laughs]

83
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,291
[TRUNKS thinking] So this is it.

84
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,583
Now we'll see why Goku's
been acting so confident

85
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,083
all this time.

86
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,625
Folks if you're just
tuning in there's great news!

87
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:05,791
Just moments ago,
Mr. Satan confided in me

88
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:08,208
he simply lost
his footing in the ring!

89
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:12,125
So once he ties his shoes,
he'll be back for more!

90
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,625
In the meantime,

91
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,916
we might as well get another
preliminary bout over with.

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,333
This time Cell's challenger
will be that cocky guy

93
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,666
with the big hair!

94
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,791
But don't go too far
away from your sets, folks,

95
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,375
because this little
skirmish shouldn't take long!

96
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,083
In my professional opinion,

97
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,500
this could get pretty
ugly for the guy.

98
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,125
Hercule, any
comments on the fight,

99
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,583
or maybe some advice
for the challenger?

100
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,500
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

101
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,125
Just by looking at the runt,

102
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,791
all I gotta say is ya
better have a stretcher

103
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,208
and an ambulance standing by!

104
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,583
Goku is just awesome!

105
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:49,125
[TIEN] His form, it's flawless!

106
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,083
Just look at him...

107
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,666
he's standing right
in front of Cell

108
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,833
like it's just another
day at the beach.

109
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:05,666
Yeah, it would almost appear
like he's enjoying the moment.

110
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,333
With all this new control
as a Super Saiyan,

111
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,458
he's by far the best
chance this planet has.

112
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,916
Well, if I were
fighting that twerp,

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,833
I'd bend him into a pretzel
and eat him for lunch!

114
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,875
But, lucky for him,
I'm on a strict diet!

115
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,541
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

116
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,750
Enough joking.
Here's my prediction:

117
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,041
In five seconds, that
kid's gonna be history!

118
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,625
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

119
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,125
I sure hope he's
got a health plan!

120
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,375
But, really, it's good
that he's fighting

121
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,208
because it'll make my
fight look even better!

122
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,791
[MR. SATAN laughs]

123
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,250
Ding!

124
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,833
[GOKU grunts]

125
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,500
[GOKU yelps]

126
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:26,625
[GOKU yelling]

127
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:32,333
[grunting,
blows landing]

128
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,250
[GOKU] Hmph.

129
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,625
[BOTH whimpering]

130
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,208
[gasping]

131
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:06,625
Their strength
appears to be equal.

132
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,000
And so far, it looks
like neither of them

133
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,000
are even short of breath!

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,666
The challenger seems to be
stronger than we thought...

135
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,666
Now, with his expert
analysis, here's Mr. Satan...

136
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,833
Your thoughts
on the fight so far?

137
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,708
Ahh... Your thoughts?

138
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,125
Uhh...

139
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,041
What, do you think
of the fight so far?

140
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,333
Oh, yeah... Fight! Ah, right!

141
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:43,166
I think it's a good fight, but
I would beat both of them

142
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,291
with one hand tied
behind my back.

143
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,916
[MR. SATAN laughs nervously]

144
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,625
[BOTH gasp]

145
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,458
[BOTH gasp]

146
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,458
[CELL grunts]

147
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,666
[BOTH gasp]

148
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,458
Look, he's out!

149
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,916
He's right!

150
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,083
Huh...?

151
00:12:56,083 --> 00:13:00,916
Sorry, but did you think
you had defeated me?

152
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,458
Ha! I won't fall
for your cheap pranks!

153
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,833
I knew all along

154
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,000
that it wouldn't be that
easy to take you out, Cell!

155
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,333
I thought it'd be appropriate
to play a little joke

156
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:18,791
since you aren't
fighting me seriously.

157
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,500
Hey, you're
holding back as well.

158
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,916
Little by little,
I shall reveal to you...

159
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,791
the perfect power
that lies within me!

160
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
Bring it on!

161
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:21,458
You seem to be enjoying
yourself very much.

162
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,666
I'm not surprised.

163
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,041
As a Saiyan, fighting
is all you live for.

164
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,791
Are you saying
you're any different?

165
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,250
[CELL chuckles]

166
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
It depends on who I'm fighting.

167
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,208
Well, then...

168
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,625
I'll try not to disappoint you.

169
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,708
Where'd they go?

170
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,166
Huh?!

171
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,500
[BOTH gasp]

172
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,416
I've never seen
anything like this!

173
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,708
They keep disappearing!

174
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,541
It's just a cheap
optical illusion!

175
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,208
I've seen it before, see...

176
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,666
It's all done with mirrors.

177
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,416
That's amazing!

178
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,916
Wow, Hercule, with all
your genius and knowledge, why,

179
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,166
I bet you could do
the same thing if you wanted,

180
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,375
like RIGHT NOW if you wanted!

181
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,625
But, I can't...

182
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:59,166
seem to figure out where
they've hidden the mirrors.

183
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,083
Can you, Hercule? Huh!?

184
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,750
Hey! Where did
you go, Mr. Satan?

185
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,583
Don't you realize
we're live on the air?!

186
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,708
Don't do this to me!

187
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,375
Come out, come out
where ever you are!

188
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,833
Ladies and gentlemen,

189
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,833
I can't explain it,
but the champ has vanished!

190
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,625
[MR. SATAN laughs]

191
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:22,625
Alright, Hercule,
where were you?

192
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:25,708
As you and your television
audience have just witnessed,

193
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,625
I, too, am a master
of optical illusion!

194
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:29,958
Oh, yeah, that's right!

195
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:32,875
[ANNOUNCER] Man alive!
You really had me stumped!

196
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,750
Where'd he get the material
for that gorgeous cape?

197
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,916
I saw he and Piiza
sewing it up last night!

198
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,666
[KRILLIN laughs]

199
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,666
[KRILLIN] These doorknobs
are cracking me up!

200
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,541
[KRILLIN chuckles]

201
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,458
Krillin!

202
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,625
I'm sorry...

203
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,666
Their speed, it's incredible!

204
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
I can't keep up!

205
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,416
[VEGETA thinking] Ha!
So you think that's fast?

206
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,041
Wait until you see me!

207
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,583
[VEGETA chuckles]

208
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:14,291
[BOTH gasp]

209
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,125
[TRUNKS gasps]

210
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,958
[PICCOLO growls]

211
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,250
[KRILLIN whimpers]

212
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,833
It looks like those
two are back at it again.

213
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,291
This is just what
gives fighting a bad name!

214
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,333
[CELL chuckles]

215
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,208
[CELL chuckles]

216
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,166
Goku!

217
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:14,041
[blows landing]

218
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,500
Ohh, I see them now!

219
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:19,416
Like I said,
they were just hiding!

220
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,916
[gasping]

221
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,458
You feel that terrific force?!

222
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,041
That's the same thing I felt

223
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,083
when he knocked me
from the ring!

224
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,125
Yes, same here.

225
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,958
There's something most
very strange going on here.

226
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,500
They keep on cheating with
these second-grade illusions!

227
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,958
They clearly have no respect
for the Martial Arts!

228
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:53,958
Goku!

229
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,750
The edge of the ring!

230
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,833
It looks like Cell's in control!

231
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,458
But how come?

232
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,291
How come Dad isn't
taking this seriously?

233
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,708
What?

234
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,166
[VEGETA chuckles]

235
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,083
[VEGETA thinking] Well,
well... Just as I thought!

236
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:18,083
Kakarot and Cell are simply
having sport with one another!

237
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,083
[CELL chuckles]

238
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:41,708
Oh, you're good.

239
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:01,291
[GOKU] Kaa... Mee...

240
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,958
Haa... Mee...

241
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,125
[GOKU] Haaaaa!

242
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,166
[CELL gasps]

243
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,041
--[GOKU grunts]
--[CELL yells]

244
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,541
[CELL growls]

245
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:24,000
[GOKU grunts]

246
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,833
Alright, I suppose that
was a good enough warm-up.

247
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,583
Yeah.

248
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,041
Huh?

249
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,458
That was
just their warm-up?!

250
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:57,083
Well, it looks
like they're ready

251
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,208
to get down to it for real!

252
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,875
[GOKU thinking] He's just
as strong as I imagined,

253
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,208
and that means
I've gotta be on edge.

254
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:27,458
One slip, and it'll
be all over...

255
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:34,625
[gasping]

256
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,333
[GOKU growls]

257
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,791
Now!

258
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,666
[TRUNKS thinking] Hey,
what's going on?

259
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,916
Goku, what are you up to?

260
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,208
[CELL thinking] Yes,
now we will see!

261
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,708
[BOTH whimpering]

262
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,125
[CELL chuckles]

263
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,000
[NARRATOR]
The practice runs are over,

264
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:27,916
and Goku is ready to exert his
true power as a Super Saiyan.

265
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,166
Will Goku finally reveal the
secret to his confidence?

266
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,666
Does he in fact have the
power to defeat the evil Cell?

267
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,250
What new powers
did Goku discover

268
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,583
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber?

269
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,916
The answers are soon to come,

270
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,416
as the deep strengths
hidden inside our hero

271
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,416
are rising to the top!

272
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,291
Don't miss the
boiling point,

273
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:54,041
next time on Dragon Ball Z!
