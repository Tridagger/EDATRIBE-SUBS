00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,041
[ANNOUNCER] Heyyyyyy!
All you crazy fans!

2
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,708
[NARRATOR] Previously
on Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,333
It was time at last for the

4
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,666
World Martial Arts
Tournament to begin.

5
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,291
And who better to lead off the
opening ceremonies

6
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:26,916
than the reigning
champ himself, Mr. Satan?

7
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,208
The big day kicked-off
with the Junior Competition.

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,416
The event started in
promising fashion,

9
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,875
but all the fans
cheering for action

10
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,791
were soon struck speechless as
these young warriors

11
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,250
showcased their rather
unconventional techniques.

12
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:51,750
--[wailing]
--[grunting]

13
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,208
[screaming]

14
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,333
[NARRATOR] Yes--despite
some heavy competition,

15
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,375
the tournament was
quickly shaping up

16
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,666
to be more farce than fight.

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,833
--[KORI-YU grunting]
--[ANNOUNCER yells]

18
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:08,125
[NARRATOR] That is, until
Trunks entered the arena!

19
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,166
[IDASA] Come on! Fight!

20
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,375
Don't you worry...

21
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:14,083
You'll feel it soon
enough, big-mouth.

22
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,333
[NARRATOR] The contest took a
serious turn as the young Saiyan

23
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:20,416
expertly defeated his
opponent with a single kick!

24
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,833
[IDASA'S MOM screams]

25
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,416
[IDASA grunts]

26
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,916
[NARRATOR] Trunks easily set the
standard for the competition,

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,375
but there was one other
fighter who could match it.

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,083
In a brilliant display of skill
and determination,

29
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,708
Goten rapidly advanced through
the ranks of the tournament.

30
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,833
[GOKU] Alright, Goten!
Woo-hoo! Yeah!

31
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,125
Aww! What a little guy, huh?
And handsome, too! 

32
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,291
[NARRATOR] It was a proud
moment indeed for Goku,

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,791
who watched from the stands as
his son took center stage.

34
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,250
[ANNOUNCER] Allright!
Fighters, are you ready?!

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,958
Let's do it!

36
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,208
[IKOSE yells]

37
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,791
[IKOSE yelling]

38
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:03,875
Gosh... This is it?
This isn't any fun...

39
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,208
[NARRATOR] The competition
tried, but fell by the wayside,

40
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:10,750
until only the final
two fighters remained.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:15,875
[TRUNKS] Just to let you know
I am going to win. Understood?

42
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,625
Yeah! I'm going
for the win, too.

43
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:19,583
[GOTEN chuckles]

44
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:31,958

00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,416
[grunting,

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,875
[BOTH grunt]

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,458
This... isn't happening!

49
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:49,041
Who are they?!

50
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:55,166
[CROWD gasping,
murmuring]

51
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:04,875

[ANNOUNCER laughs]

55
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,375
[thinking] I can't believe it!

56
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:39,833
This is the match I've been
waiting for all of these years!

57
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:42,833
Just when I was starting to
give up hope, it came!

58
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,208
This is too good to be true!

59
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:46,458
And this is only
the Junior Division!

60
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,541
[KRILLIN] Check those
two out, would ya?

61
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,875
Staring each other down
in classic stance!

62
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,166
I love it!

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,250
They're really doing
well! That's for sure!

64
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,500
[KRILLIN] Awesome!
Way better than I expected!

65
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,791
This match could get
really interesting!

66
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,375
[CHICHI] Come on, Goten!
You can do it, Son!

67
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,583
Yaye, Trunks!
You're doing great, Son!

68
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,416
Pretty impressive. Somehow
you've managed to get

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,291
a lot stronger than the
last time we faught.

70
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,541
Ha, ha! Gee, thanks, Trunks!
I owe it all to Gohan though!

71
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,291
He's the one that's been
training me all this time.

72
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,750
[TRUNKS] Well, he did good.

73
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:26,041
But... not good
enough! Try this!

74
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,916
Huh?

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,791
[TRUNKS growls]

76
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,333
Oh no!

77
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,875
This place is way too crowded
to be firing energy blasts!

78
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,833
He... could really
hurt someone!

79
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,791
We can't let him do it!

80
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,458
Ahh, it'll be okay!

81
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,291
[KRILLIN] Huh?

82
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,708
Really! Just look at him...
The kid's in complete control.

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,833

86
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,166
It's gonna hit!

[CROWD gasps]

89
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,708
Wow! What in the
world was that?!

90
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know! It looked
like some kind of rocket!

91
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,458
[MAN 1] But isn't rocket
fire against the rules?!

92
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:15,375
[MAN 2] Oh, yes!
Most definitely!

93

94
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,583

97
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,833
I... I've seen this before!

98
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,125
At the Cell games!

[CROWD gasping,
murmuring]

100
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,250
Nice, huh? What did you think?

101
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,208
That was really cool!

102
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,666
Gohan taught me a little
bit of that stuff too!

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,333
Watch! Check this out!

104
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,666

Oh! Did he teach
you how to control it?!

Goten...?

108

--[KRILLIN squeals]
--Oh well...

112
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:13,333
I guess, Goten still has a
little bit of practicing

113
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,500
to do on that one...

114
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,583

tarnation's going on?

00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,375
Are those little tikes from
another planet or something?!

118
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,666
Whoa!

119
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,708
I-I-It... can't be!

120
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,958
They have the
same kind of powers

121
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,208
as those guys
who faught Cell!

122

[GOTEN laughs]

123
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,166
Oops! I blew up the roof!

124
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,750
You sure did! We better
cool it! No more beams!

125

the whole place up!

[IDASA'S MOM] What?!
Absolutely not! Keep working!

ashamed of yourselves,

embarrassed in my entire life!

buying that rubbish!

nowhere for him to hide...

and gentlemen!

It's difficult to see
from down here,

173
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,625
but it looks like Trunks has
young Goten in a stranglehold!

00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,125
so, that makes us
even-steven! One time each!

350
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,041
As far as using the
left hand goes,

351
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,666
I did slip up a little bit,

352
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,291
but I still didn't use
it to punch you! Right?!

353
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,833
Come on! Don't be mad at me!

354
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,791
I'll tell you what!

355
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,875
You can have
three of my toys!

356
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,083
You pick 'em!

357
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,666
What?! Really?! Cool!

358
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,416
I get to pick! Wow!
I know which ones too!

359
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Thank you, Trunks!

360
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,958
[GOTEN laughs]

361
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
[ANNOUNCER] Ladies
and Gentlemen,

362
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,333
before get started with
the adult competition...

363
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,500
we're going to have
our special exhibition match

364
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,000
between the new Junior
World Champion, Trunks,

365
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:58,166
and Mr. Satan, the reigning
World Martial Arts Champion!

366
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:04,250
--[CROWD cheers]
--[MR. SATAN whimpers]

367
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:08,375
[ANNOUNCER]
That's right! Mr. Satan!

368
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:13,541
The most renowned Martial
Artist in the world!

369
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:16,333
The hero who saved
the world from Cell!

370
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,083
What a treat, to see this
veteran Master of the arts

371
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:25,833
in a friendly match with Trunks,
the rising, new rookie star!

372
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,333
Ha! This isn't going to be
much of a fight, you know?

373
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,875
Right! You better not
blink, or you'll miss it!

374
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,125
[KRILLIN laughs]

375
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,083
[VEGETA chuckles]

376
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:37,875
Trunks is going to
pulverise this noisy fool.

377
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:41,041
World Champion? I've known
stronger house-plants.

378
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,458
Oh, yeah right, Vegeta!

379
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,916
[GOHAN laughs]

380
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,708
Come on, Jokester!

381
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:47,791
Uh-huh...?

382
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,166
[GOHAN] What a crazy,
funny guy, huh?!

383
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,583
[GOHAN laughs]

384
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,416
[GOHAN] Oh, man!
That's a good one!

385
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,208
Vegeta! He should be a comedian!
He's got a million of 'em!

386
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,166
[ANNOUNCER] Alright, folks!

387
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,916
The reigning World Champion

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,875
should be coming out
any minute now!

389
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,791
[GOTEN laughs]

390
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,583
Wow, cool! I wish I was champ!

391
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,375
[GOTEN laughs]

392
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,416
[ANNOUNCER] I know he's
around here somewhere, folks!

393
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,958
How about a big cheer
to lure him out?!

394
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:19,708
--Give it up for Mr. Satan!
--[CROWD cheers]

395
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,541
[ANNOUNCER] Alright! Now that's
what I call a hero's welcome!

396
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,750
[cheering continues]

397
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,541
[ANNOUNCER]
Unbelievable! It didn't work!

398
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,750
--Can we get it a little louder?
--[cheering grows louder]

399
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,916
[ANNOUNCER] Come on!
You can get louder than that!

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,291
One more time! Give
it everything you've got!

401
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:41,375
Ready! One, two, three... Go!

402
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:44,083
[CROWD roars]

403
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,750
[ANNOUNCER] Alright! Alright!

404
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:48,458
Nobody can resist
a welcome like that!

405
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,666
Where are you, Mr. Satan?!

406
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,416
--Come on out!
--[MR. SATAN wails]
