1
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,125
[NARRATOR] Last time,
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,750
Gohan's trials
continued,

3
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,333
as the creatures
of the wilderness

4
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,750
fought to capture him
for a tasty snack.

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,708
And it was all
Gohan could do

6
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,541
to keep himself
out of their claws!

7
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,250
Gohan's adventures dropped
him into the dark center

8
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,750
of an ancient ruin,
where fortunately for him,

9
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,416
he discovered he
had some company...

10
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,958
[ROBOT] Who are you?!

11
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,208
[NARRATOR] But when the ruins
suddenly began to collapse,

12
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,250
Gohan's robot friend threw
himself into harm's way,

13
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,708
and held back the falling
rock just long enough

14
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:45,375
for the young
boy to escape.

15
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,000
[GOHAN sobs]

16
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:47,916
[GOHAN]
Please!

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,416
[ROBOT]
Time to shut down...

18
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,083
It's my fault...

19
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,125
[NARRATOR]
Now, alone once again,

20
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:59,083
Gohan journeys into the unknown
with a new determination

21
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:00,458
to make himself stronger,

22
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,166
so that the next time
trouble rears its head,

23
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,500
he'll be able to
help his friends...

24
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:09,541
Good luck, Gohan! The
Saiyans arrive in one year!

25
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,291
[GOHAN] It's harder bringing you
back than it was catching you!

26
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,208
[GOHAN grunts]

27
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,875
[breathes heavily]

28
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,166
Ah, berries...

29
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,000
Hm?

30
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:05,750
Now, just a little
bit farther...

31
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,291
Ahh, yum!

32
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,666
Uh oh, I better
get back.

33
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,166
Aahh!

34
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,125
[groans]

35
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,583
Ow...

36
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,333
[lightning strikes]

37
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,208
[GOHAN whimpers]

38
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,333
[animal growls]

39
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,541
[GOHAN yells and whimpers]

[lightning strikes]

41
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,291
[GOHAN]
I can't believe this.

42
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,416
I never thought I'd have
to do this myself...

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,416
I hope I'm
doing it right...

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,666
Uh...

45
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:23,916
[GOHAN bawls]

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
[GOKU]
There we go!

47
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,000
[bawling]

48
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,708
No, daddy!
It hurts!

49
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,666
I know it stings a
little bit, Gohan...

50
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,000
But I promise
it'll help!

51
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,250
No, I don't want
any of that stuff!

52
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,416
I want Mom to do it!

53
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,416
[sobs]

54
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,333
Come on...

55
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:44,916
[winces]

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,041
That's it! You did it!

57
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,625
Now it'll be better in no time.

58
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,750
[GOHAN] All right.
Here it goes...

59
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,166
[winces]

60
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:09,375
[CROWD cheers]

61
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
[helicopter whirs]

62
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,916
[ANNOUNCER #1] It's the
bottom of the ninth,

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,708
the defending
champions are leading

64
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,458
the Taitans
six to three...

65
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,666
And it's the pitch!

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,500
[UMPIRE]
Strike!

67
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,958
[CROWD cheers]

68
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,833
[ANNOUNCER 1] Murdock caught
swinging on the change up!

69
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:28,375
Oh-ho boy! You know he's gotta
be hating himself for that one!

70
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,041
[ANNOUNCER #2] You've got
that right, Martin...

71
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,125
And you can bet the
intimidation factor

72
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,250
from this man here had
a little something to do

73
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,375
with that little lapse
in concentration!

74
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,541
[ANNOUNCER 1] Absolutely! Rocky
Rivers has hit more batters,

75
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,208
and he's pitched
fewer innings

76
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,208
than any other pitcher
in the league!

77
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:44,625
[ANNOUNCER 2]
Now those are stats

78
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,791
you don't want to
write home about.

79
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,708
[ANNOUNCER 1] And the
pressure has got to be

80
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,291
mounting for that man.

81
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,041
[ANNOUNCER 2] Right! Yamcha's
already hit three solo homers,

82
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,583
but how long can he
keep up the streak?

83
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,833
What's up, Puar?

84
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,500
Gee, I thought you
were snoozing!

85
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,083
Aren't you nervous
about winning the game?

86
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,625
[YAMCHA sighs]

87
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,041
[YAMCHA] What's there to be
nervous about? This is too easy.

88
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,208
It seems like every time
I step up to the plate

89
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,166
I hit a home run.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah, but that's a
good thing, isn't it?

91
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:20,291
I'm a fighter, Puar!
I'm not a ball player!

92
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,541
Don't talk
like that!

93
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,458
Fighting doesn't pay
the rent, Yamcha.

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,791
You have to make
money somehow!

95
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,916
[ANNOUNCER #1] Rocky Rivers
with the windup... The pitch!

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,083
[MURDOCK groans]

97
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,166
[ANNOUNCER 1] Oh!
And Murdock's been hit!

98
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,666
Atta' boy, Murdock!
Alright!

99
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,666
Hey, Yamcha!

100
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,208
Huh?

101
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,875
We got two men on
for you hot-shot!

102
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,041
You can bring 'em in,
can't you?

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:48,291
Hey, it's worth a bonus.
Well, what d'ya think, huh?

104
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,625
It's a pretty
big game.

105
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,583
The Pennant...
Twenty thousand zeni...

106
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,083
How's that for
a nice bonus?

107
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,833
It's hard to believe
the entire season's

108
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,541
resting on my shoulders.

109
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,708
That's an awful
lot of pressure...

110
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,291
Twenty-thousand
it is.

111
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,541
[HEAD COACH and YAMCHA laugh]

112
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,916
Wow. That'll pay the rent.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,375
[ANNOUNCER #1] And there's
the Taitan's slugger, Yamcha,

114
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,125
in the warm up box...

115
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,166
Tying run at
the plate...

116
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,083
[UMPIRE] Play ball!

117
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,541
[ANNOUNCER 1]
Two men on...

118
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:19,166
Bottom of the ninth... Two outs.

119
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
[ANNOUNCER #2]
And look at Freddie Hines

120
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,333
signaling in to
Pepper Johnson

121
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,500
Bottom of the ninth...
The Pennant at stake...

122
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,250
You have to wonder
with all the pressure

123
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,625
if he even knows
what he's doing.

124
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,000
[ANNOUNCER 1] Looks like he's
had too much coffee to me!

125
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,500
Heh, ha!

126
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,375
And here's the pitch!

127
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,166
[UMPIRE]
Striiiiiike one!

128
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,166
[ANNOUNCER 1] Johnson caught
looking, or rather, not looking.

129
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,208
And you have to wonder
just what signal

130
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,208
the Taitan manager
sent in earlier.

131
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,208
Here it comes, ladies.

132
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,250
[ANNOUNCER 1]
And here's the pitch!

133
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,166
Breaking ball...

134
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,333
Ha, ha!

135
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,708
[ANNOUNCER 1] Oh!
Now Johnson's been hit!

136
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,500
[commotion]

137
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,000
[ANNOUNCER 1]
That's two in one inning!

138
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,291
[ANNOUNCER 2] Boy, that's
not going to go over well.

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,666
Pepper Johnson is
obviously shaken-up.

140
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,875
I wouldn't be surprised if
a fight broke out here.

141
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:11,333
Hey! You jerk!
You did that on purpose!

142
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:15,416
So what! What do you think
you're gonna do about it?

143
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,875
That's it,
meat-head!

144
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:17,916
Come on!

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
[ANNOUNCER #1]
There goes Johnson!

146
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,041
And now both benches
are clearing! What a game!

147
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,250
[ANNOUNCER 2] I've never seen
anything like this, Martin!

148
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,833
Not in a
Pennant race!

149
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,875
[ANNOUNCER 1] And there's
the Taitan slugger, Yamcha!

150
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,875
So far he's one of
the few players

151
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,791
that's chosen not
get involved....

152
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,041
[ANNOUNCER 2] He probably
doesn't want to get hurt.

153
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:43,083
[YAMCHA laughs forcefully]

154
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,916
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,458
Yamcha, stay
out of it!

156
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:50,583
You don't want to hurt
anybody, now do you?

157
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,125
Oh, Puar, it's just a little
rumble! I'll try to be careful!

158
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,625
Okay, have fun!

159
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,875
Oh, my...

160
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,916
[YAMCHA laughs]

161
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,416
You little punk!

162
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:11,416
[MAN] Hey!

163
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,166
Hello!

164
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,458
Huh?

165
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,333
Krillin!
What are you doing here?

166
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,791
Y'know,
just hangin'!

167
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,708
I do have something I need
to tell you though, Yamcha.

168
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,458
Why don't we
go over here?

169
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,708
[CROWD roars]

170
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,166
[PUAR] What?

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,458
[YAMCHA]
Are you serious?

172
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,666
[PUAR]
But, Goku can't be... dead.

173
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,666
Yeah... he
sacrificed himself.

174
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,666
[PUAR and YAMCHA exclaim]

175
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,125
But don't forget about
the Dragon Balls!

176
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,708
Once we get all seven
we can wish him back!

177
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,000
C'mon,
follow me!

178
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,125
Hm?

179
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:46,875
Hi!

180
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,083
[giggles]

181
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,041
[BULMA]
Oh... You jerk!

182
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:52,875
[KRILLIN] Huh?
Hey... Guys?

183
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,916
Bulma's still mad about
the time you stood her up!

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,916
You should explain that you
were just out of money.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,208
Huh! Yamcha was broke
ninety-nine percent

186
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,583
of the time anyway!

187
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,541
Besides, he took
Becky Hafford

188
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,916
to see the concert
three nights later!

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I had tickets..
You wouldn't go!

190
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,958
[BULMA grunts angrily]

191
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,958
[KRILLIN quivers]

192
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,416
Man! Being a jerk just
comes so natural to you!

193
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Yeah? Well, I'd say
I owe all my training

194
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:21,083
in that department
to you, Bulma.

195
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,333
Krillin, if you need some
help against those Saiyans,

196
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,791
let me know.

197
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,833
Wait a second! That's what
I came to talk to you about!

198
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,333
I do need you!

199
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,083
Korin wants us all to report
to him for special training!

200
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,333
For real, Krillin?

201
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:34,333
[KRILLIN] Mm-hm.

202
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:38,625
[YAMCHA laughs]

203
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:42,041
Well, too bad!
You're gonna miss out!

204
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,666
Huh?!

205
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,208
Hey! C'mon guys!
We don't want to be late!

206
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,458
Korin's waiting,
you know!

207
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,041
[GROUP]
Uhh...

208
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:11,791
[snoring]

209
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,458
[yells]

210
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,916
Oh man, that's sharp!
Poor arm...

211
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,333
It all looks
the same...

212
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,583
I don't even know how long
I've been running...

213
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,916
It doesn't feel like I'm
any closer to the end now

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,291
than I was
when I started...

215
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:46,333
[snoring]

216
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:03,625
[chewing sounds]

217
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,583
[birds chirp]

218
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,458
[GOHAN] Wow, I slept
like a rock...

219
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,583
[GOHAN screams
and DINOSAUR roars]

220
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,791
[breathes heavily]

221
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,166
My heart feels like it's
going to pop out of my chest!

222
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,250
Wait, I can't
run away!

223
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,583
My dad wouldn't run away...
Besides, my sword's in there!

224
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,500
Aaaahhh!

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,041
[GOHAN] Uh, actually, I can
come back for my sword later...

226
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,250
if you want.

227
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:23,125
[whimpers]

228
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,416
[gasps]

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,958
[DINOSAUR groans]

230
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:45,000
Goodness... That's gonna
have to come out.

231
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,666
Hey, this is
gonna hurt,

232
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,375
but you'll feel better
when it's all over.

233
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,208
[GOHAN grunts]

234
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:57,958
[DINOSAUR groans]

235
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:03,000
[GOHAN grunts]

236
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,208
[GOHAN yells]

237
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,708
[DINOSAUR roars]

238
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:29,541
Whoa! Poor guy! This was
in deeper than I thought.

239
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,041
Hmm...

240
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,875
[GOHAN] This is something
my dad showed me.

241
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,291
It'll fix you right up!

242
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,750
Trust me... You're
not the only one...

243
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,458
[chuckles]

244
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,666
[grunts]

245
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,083
There we go!

246
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,000
[DINOSAUR grumbles]

247
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,916
I know! It stings!
But I promise it'll help!

248
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,125
[GOHAN]
I'm back!

249
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,166
There. I think that
should be enough.

250
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,375
Aaahhh!

251
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,958
Great! Now I need to find
more food for my friend...

252
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,291
And I know
just the place

253
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,041
where I can get tons
of berries for him.

254
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,916
He'll like those!

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,958
[laughs]

256
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:52,083
[rustling and growling]

257
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,666
Wow! I haven't felt this
good in a long time!

258
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,125
There's going to be
a fight, isn't there?

259
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,041
[BULMA]
That's right!

260
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,291
And it's not going to be pretty.

261
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,625
[KRILLIN]
Mm-hmm...

262
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,166
[KAMCHA] Well I'm not gonna bow
down to those Saiyan jerks!

263
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,833
We've got Piccolo
on our side

264
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,375
and Goku's gonna be back
even stronger than before!

265
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,875
[BULMA] That's true...

266
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,041
And besides,
it's not every day

267
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,083
you get a chance to be
trained by Korin himself!

268
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,875
Hey! Right, Yamcha!

269
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,791
Korin's training will
make us stronger, too!

270
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,708
We might be
twice as strong!

271
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:35,000
That's true!
It's possible!

272
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:36,958
In any case,
those sorry Saiyans

273
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,500
are going to have
their hands full.

274
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,041
I'll make
sure of that!

275
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,541
Wow! Now you're
talking, Yamcha!

276
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,625
Yeah!

277
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,250
[PUAR sighs]

278
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,625
Oh great! She still
likes him. Bummer...

279
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,208
Oh! How romantic!

280
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,375
[KRILLIN]
Eh...

281
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,583
You know...
I wonder...

282
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,750
Maybe after the big
fella' gets better,

283
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,166
I can keep him as a pet!
That'd be so much fun.

284
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,250
And it'd be great having
a friend to keep me company.

285
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:28,625
[laughs]

286
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:31,625
Can't wait! Ha, ha, ha!

287
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:35,500
Wow! My arms are getting
pretty beefy! Heh, heh, heh!

288
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,791
Hm?

289
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,458
[GOHAN] Well, I have
to try it sometime...

290
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,625
I guess today's as
good a day as any.

291
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,625
[quivers]

292
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,416
[yells]

293
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,833
Hmm... Maybe it's time I
tested my strength out, too.

294
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,500
My dad could make
rubble outta this rock.

295
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,291
Aahh! Hm.

296
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,666
Yah!

297
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,666
[whimpers]

298
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,875
Not even a crack...

299
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,583
[GOHAN]
I'm back again!

300
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,041
I was gonna get
you some berries,

301
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,500
but I couldn't
find any.

302
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,916
Instead, I found a bunch of
fruit I think you'll like.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,958
[roaring]

304
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,541
[whimpers]

305
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,416
No!

306
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,583
Somebody!

307
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,791
Ah! Please! Help!

308
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,208
So it's you! I'm not gonna
let you hurt my friend!

309
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,958
Let him go,
right now!

310
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,416
I mean it!

311
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,708

313
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,250
Haaaaa...

[chewing sounds]

322
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,500
Gotta...
keep... going.

[birds chirp]

324
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,916
[GOHAN]
What happened?

325
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,958
[GOHAN thinking]
Oh no, my friend...

326
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,500
[NARRATOR] The course of nature
isn't always easy to accept.

327
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:32,083
But as Gohan is learning,
in the remote wilderness,

328
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:35,000
survival of the fittest is
the only law of the land.

329
00:22:35,083 --> 00:22:36,541
And difficult
though it may be,

330
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,125
sometimes there
is little choice

331
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,333
but to put the past
behind and forge ahead!

00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:53,916
