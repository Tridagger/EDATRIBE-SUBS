It was bomb's away

00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,416
on the last episode
of Dragon Ball Z,

3
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,916
as Goku launched
the Spirit Bomb

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,166
with the full
force of his being.

5
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,375
[GOKU] Maybe you'll
come back some day.

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:30,166
As... As a better person,
I hope. I'd like that.

7
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,333
Perhaps we'll have
a little one-on-one!

8
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:38,083
[NARRATOR] It was time to say
goodbye and send Buu packing!

9
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,208
[GOKU]
Adios!

10
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,708
I'll be waiting
for you, Majin Buu!

There was nothing left to do

15
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,291
except to beat the Buu!

17
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,833
[NARRATOR] And with a
resounding flourish of power,

18

Goku wrote the final
words in the chapter

19
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:02,833
and closed the book
on his old nemesis

20
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,250
once and for all!

At last, the war was over.

Nothing remained of Majin Buu
except the battle scars

24
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,958

I think so.

[GOHAN] But is it over for good?
Or is he going to regenerate?

38

No, there's not a
trace of him left.

gone this time, you guys.

better get to Vegeta first.

He really got the

Right.

Hey, little green guy,
come here! Quick!

Have you lost your mind?! Move!

Get back! It's not
over until he is dead!

103
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,833
But he's different than he was!

104
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:38,291
He would never do those
bad things ever again!

You saw him!

He faught that evil

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,625
[VEGETA] All right,
and what if he's not all gone?

108
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,500
What if he blows his stack again

109
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:50,250
and produces another
killing machine? What then?!

00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,166
Well, I don't know.

mean the end of the world!

You might be willing to
take that gamble, but I'm not!

[MR. SATAN] But h-he
wouldn't have blown his stack

if that idiot hadn't shot
his puppy with a rifle!

Please! I beg you!

Are you nuts?

I'm just returning
the favor, that's all.

127
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,333
Remember what happened when
Majin Buu had you pinned down?

128
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,791
The big Buu attacked
and got him off of you.

129
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,041
And then yelled for Hercule
to carry you off to safety.

130
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,541
[MR. SATAN]
I've got you...

131
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,833
Hey, you! What're
you waiting for?

132
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,291
Right?

133
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,916
[GOKU] The fact is, Vegeta,
if it wasn't for these two,

134
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
the Earth would
be gone right now.

135
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,166
I think that gives them
as much right to live here

136
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,083
as anyone else!
And you know it.

137
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:26,375
Yes, but, the Earthlings
don't know what went on up here.

138
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,500
I think that their fear of Buu

139
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,250
is going to cause
some serious problems.

140
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,333
Yeah, I see what you mean.

141
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,833
Let's see...

142
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,541
I guess we could keep Buu
indoors and away from everyone

143
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,041
for the first six months.

144
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,750
Then we could
use the Dragon Balls

145
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,666
to wish the Earthlings'
memory of Buu away.

146
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,583
See? It's that simple.

147
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,666
Yeah, sure! Just
wish it away! Great!

148
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,916
Well, then. It's
all settled, right?

149

you guys, but I'm starving!

head home and get a bite to eat!
