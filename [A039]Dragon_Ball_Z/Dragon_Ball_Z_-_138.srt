00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,750
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,625
Krillin was spared
a three-fisted face lift

3
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,250
when the trio
of evil androids

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,250
decided to go after
larger prey-- Goku!

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,125
And it looks like Vegeta's ego
will take a long time to heal.

6
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,833
[VEGETA] No one makes a fool
of me! They'll pay for this!

7
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,166
They should have finished
me off when they had the chance,

8
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,958
because I will show
them no mercy!

9
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:40,916
[NARRATOR] It seems Piccolo has
turned his back on his friends,

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,375
just when they need
his help the most.

11
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,625
[PICCOLO] I'm leaving,

12
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:48,083
and anyone who tries to
follow me will be sorry!

13
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,083
Don't worry, guys.

14
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,583
Piccolo just has
a lot on his mind...

15
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,375
He's still one
of the good guys!

16
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,000
Piccolo has gone
to Kami's place

17
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,375
to join with him again!

18
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,666
Together, they'll
be an unstoppable force...

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,875
...a Super Namek!

20
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,916
[NARRATOR] The androids must be
stopped before it's too late.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,666
But can Piccolo convince Kami
to make the ultimate sacrifice?

22
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,666
FInd out today!

23
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,375
[PICCOLO thinking] I know Kami
senses something is wrong...

24
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,333
Why doesn't he say something?

25
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,708
[KAMI thinking] Things must be
more serious than I thought.

26
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,375
Uh? Kami...?

27
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:13,291
This isn't a social call it's
business! I think you know that.

28
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,750
Yes, I know...

29
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,208
Of course, I do.

30
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:23,208
The bond we share is of the mind
as well as the body, remember?

31
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,708
I know exactly what's
on your mind, Piccolo.

32
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:30,041
Hmph! Good! That
saves me some time.

33
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,666
What an unexpected
honor this is.

34
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,750
I never thought that you and
I would ever be united again.

35
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,041
Stop smiling!

36
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,291
I'm not doing this
because I want too.

37
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,583
It's because I need our
combined powers. That's all.

38
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,833
To be perfectly honest,
I'm not sure how

39
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,208
I'm going to tolerate
being so close to you.

40
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,041
Your mere presence sickens me!

41
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,666
Oh... Kami!

42
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,458
[PICCOLO] Trust me,
I'd have preferred it

43
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,958
if I never had to
look at you again!

44
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,416
[KAMI growls]

45
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,625
[KAMI thinking] Piccolo's
attitude angers me,

46
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,541
but I can't blame him...

47
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,291
He is a part of me.

48
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,666
I have watched him fight

49
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,833
one formidable enemy
after another...

50
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:13,291
And he has beaten
the odds every time.

51
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,833
[PICCOLO yells]

52
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,833
No! You can't!

53
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,041
[PICCOLO yells]

54
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:21,208
[RADITZ yells]

55
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,666
[GOKU &amp; RADITZ grunt]

56
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,291
[NAPPA yells]

57
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:32,416
[GOHAN yells]

58
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,666
[PICCOLO yells]

59
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,958
Yes... unite
with me, Piccolo...

60
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:49,916
[PICCOLO grunts]

61
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,041
[KAMI] My power is nothing
compared to Piccolo's...

62
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,250
He has developed
strength and abilities

63
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,083
far greater than I
could have ever imagined.

64
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,875
[KAMI] Perhaps my time

65
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,666
as guardian of Earth
has come to an end.

66
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,875
No, Kami! You are
still needed...

67
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:14,541
The people of Earth still
need you to watch over them.

68
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,291
[KAMI] You are too kind,
Mr. Popo...

69
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,791
but I must act for
the good of the Earth.

70
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,708
This is about
the continuing struggle

71
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,958
for power between the
forces of good and evil.

72
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,958
And the danger that
looms over us now

73
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,833
poses a greater threat

74
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,333
than anything we
have faced in the past.

75
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,750
Even Vegeta
with all of his strength,

76
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,583
was no match for these androids.

77
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,666
[KAMI]
Super Saiyan or not,

78
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,875
he was tossed
aside like a rag doll!

79
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,750
These androids will
be difficult to beat.

80
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,000
Even if Goku recovers
from his illness,

81
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,583
he will provide
little resistance

82
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,375
against these
powerful new foes.

83
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,541
In our combined form,
Piccolo may be the only one

84
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,000
strong enough to win this fight!

85
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,791
We agree.

86
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,250
The force that threatens Earth
is bigger than both of us.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,708
But at least when
our powers are united

88
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,708
we still stand a chance.

89
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:15,041
And no matter how slim that
chance is, we must take it!

90
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,041
[KAMI] Hold on...

91
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,666
I haven't agreed
to anything yet!

92
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,458
Time may still
be on our side.

93
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,291
Listen, I would
like to let things

94
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,541
play out further
before I make my decision.

95
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,083
You want to see
how things play out?!

96
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,916
Have you lost your mind?!

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,583
[KAMI] Silence! Sometimes
things are not always

98
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,750
what they appear
to be, Piccolo.

99
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,833
[PICCOLO growls]

100
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,666
[KAMI] And I am
not entirely convinced

101
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,208
that the aim of these androids
is to destroy the Earth.

102
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,625
Is this a joke?!

103
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,041
You've sat
here and watched

104
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,958
everything that's
gone on below

105
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:51,250
and you're still going
to let it continue?!

106
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,083
Don't you remember
what Trunks said?!

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:56,458
The future will be
destroyed by these androids!

108
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,708
Yes, but Trunks
made a mistake.

109
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,125
He told you that the androids
you encountered today

110
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:05,375
are not the same ones
that he fought in the future.

111
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,958
[PICCOLO chuckles]

112
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,916
Yeah, right. And these androids
are a real great bunch of guys

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,500
once you get to know them.

114
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,041
I'm serious.

115
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,666
I know you may
not agree with me,

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,958
all I'm saying is I still need
more time to make up my mind.

117
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,916
[PICCOLO]
Have it your way!

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,458
You're scared! I know...

119
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:30,916
[PICCOLO] If you
need time then take it.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,500
I'll be waiting right here.

121
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,500
Hmph.

122
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:40,166
You can wait as
long as you want.

123
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,375
But remember, the
clock is ticking.

124
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,458
Hey, Krillin!

125
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,625
[KRILLIN] Yeah?

126
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,375
I think I'm going to
go pick up Chiaotzu

127
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,375
so we can get back to training.

128
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,958
Sure! Sounds good!

129
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,125
As soon as things
get dicey again,

130
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,166
we'll be there to help!

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,958
Although, I'm not sure
how much good we'll do.

132
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,708
Okay, go get Chiaotzu
and meet up with us later.

133
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,833
We're going to move Goku
over to Master Roshi's house.

134
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:29,583
That should buy us all
a little bit more time.

135
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,250
Yeah, that's
a good idea, but...

136
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,500
Be careful.

137
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,958
And take care of Goku!

138
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,416
[KRILLIN] We will.

139
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,750
Good luck, Tien!

140
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,916
We'll need it...
That's for sure.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,583
Hope we're not too late.

142
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,666
[TRUNKS] I don't know why
the future I predicted

143
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,250
changed so much...

144
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,416
The androids I fought
weren't as powerful

145
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,375
and there were
only two of them.

146
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,041
I don't get it!

147
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,125
It doesn't matter now...

148
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,291
If we don't get out
of this mess soon,

149
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,125
we're all gonna be history.

150

[birds chirping]

151
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,041
[CHICHI] I think the worst
is over now, Yamcha.

152
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,083
Don't you?

153
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,875
[YAMCHA] Yeah... Let's hope so!

154
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:30,625
[GOKU grunts softly]

155
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,500
[ANDROID 17] 18, check it out.
Looks like we found some wheels.

156
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,916
[ANDROID 18] It's about time.
Let's take it for a spin.

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,958
[ANDROID 17] All right!

158
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,875
But let me take
care of the driving.

159
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

160
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,291
[MAN A] Whoa! This coffee
doesn't look very fresh to me.

161
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,666
[MAN B] Well, it's not!

162
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,541
It's older than
my mother-in-law!

163
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,250

Let's clear this out
and make more room.

[MAN A] Hey, pal!
Get away from there!

168
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,333
Right now!

Right. We're all set.

174
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,000
Now let's go find Goku.

175
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,958
Step on it. Come on, let's go!

[VEGETA growls]

183
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:53,791

and for all that I am

the strongest warrior in
the universe! It is my destiny!

you take a new outfit

210
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,791
from one of
these goons, 18?

211

No. Theere's nothing

[DEPUTY] Yes sir!

244
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,541
[SHERIFF] Let's round
up these hooligans!

[DEPUTY] It looks like the rest
of their gang got away, sir!

[SHERIFF] That's okay!

247

Y-Y-Yuh, uh...
You are under arrest!

00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,000
That's not good...

252
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,750
Sir! He broke my handcuffs!

253
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,375
Shall I take this one?

254
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,541
[ANDROID 17] Be my guest.

255
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,458
Now... Pay attention.

256
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,833
I'm only going
to do this once.

257
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,166
Hey! Hold it!

258
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,708

[SHERIFF] Stop in
the name of the... law?

263
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,875
Follow me! We're close
to Goku's house!

Hold it... Trunks...

265
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,375
Just one question.

266
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,875
Huh?

267
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:07,166
Uh... The androids...
Are they... Uh...

268
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,250
Really as terrible
as you say they are?

269
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,000
They're ruthless
and cold-blooded.

270
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,541
I've told you that
before, Krillin.

271
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,000
Why even ask?

272
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,541
[KRILLIN wail]

273
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,708
Hey! I was just hoping that we
wouldn't all have to fight!

274
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,625
Really, that's all, man!

275
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,750
[TRUNKS] Well, hoping doesn't
get us anywhere, I'm afraid.

276
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,250
[KRILLIN] I know that!
It's just that I... well...

277
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:30,916
Oh, nevermind.

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,375
[KRILLIN whimpers]

279
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,583
Good luck.

280
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,041
Oh, Gohan!

281
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,458
Oh, it's you, Krillin.

282
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,666
[KRILLIN] Nice to
see you too, ChiChi...

283
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,708
That hurt...

284
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,500
Well, say hello.

285
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,458
Oh! Hello there.

286
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,291
Oh! Krillin! Hey!

287
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,250
Alright! I'm glad you
made it here safe!

288
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,500
And Goku?

289
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,041
[YAMCHA] He's okay...
He's sleeping right now.

290
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey, welcome back, man!

291
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
So if you guys are here,

292
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,416
you must have defeated
the androids, right?

293
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,250
[BOTH gasp]

294
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,250
Not yet...

295
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,833
I can't explain now...

296
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,666
But we have to
evacuate this place

297
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,541
and transport Goku to
Master Roshi's right away!

298
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,791
Huh?

299
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,291
[KRILLIN] We're dealing
with a group of androids

300
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:22,041
that are a thousand times
more powerful than any of us!

301
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:22,958
[CHICHI gasps]

302
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,041
What? We can't stop them?!

303
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:36,291
[CHICHI] Be careful with him!

304
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,750
[YAMCHA] Boy, I think Goku
has packed on a few pounds.

305
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:43,333
Give him a break.
He hasn't been himself lately.

306
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,666
[KRILLIN] Hey, Yamcha,
where's Gohan?

307
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,125
[YAMCHA] He should be
getting home any time now.

308
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,250
Look! Gohan's back!

309
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,166
Here he comes!

310
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,416
[GOHAN] Hey, what's going on?

311
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,958
[CHICHI] You've come
home! Oh, my baby!

312
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,125
I'm so happy to see you!

313
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,208
Uh? Hey what are
you guys doing?

314
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,875
No time to talk.
On the plane, Gohan!

315
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,416
[thinking] Something's wrong...
Something I've missed...

316
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,166
[NARRATOR] Goku is on his way
to a safer hiding place

317
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,125
but his trail is warm and the
androids are in hot pursuit.

318
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:39,708
Krillin and the others can
only hide him for so long

319
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,833
before they are discovered!

320
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,416
And if that's not enough,

321
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,416
Bulma is about to
get a telephone call

322
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,708
that will add a whole new
dimension to this crisis.

323
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:53,833
On the next Dragonball Z!
