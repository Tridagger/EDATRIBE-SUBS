00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragonball Z,

2
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,708
Cell continued his
campaign of terror

3
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,416
carving a path of destruction
by draining the life force

4
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,833
from anyone who got in his way.

5
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:27,625
Krillin found out first hand
Cell's awesome power

6
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,291
when he went
head-to-head with him

7
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,208
and ended up
trapped and helpless.

8
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:34,208
Luckily, Piccolo and Tien showed
up just in the nick of time

9
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,458
to chase the android
creature away.

10
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,125
The whole experience left
Krillin a little drained,

11
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,916
but it could have
been a lot worse.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,666
[CHICHI] Goku? What?

13
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,666
[NARRATOR] ChiChi was surprised
to find Goku out of bed

14
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,250
and even more surprised

15
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,166
to see that he was back
to his old self again.

16
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,833
[GOKU yells]

17
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:55,958
[NARRATOR] That's right, Goku
has made a full recovery,

18
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,083
but there's no time
to celebrate.

19
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,125
[GOKU] Hey, I'm alright.
Just relax now...

20
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,916
It's time for me to start
my training once again.

21
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,833
There's a level beyond
that of a Super Saiyan.

22
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,750
Huh?

23
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,458
[NARRATOR] Is Goku
still running a fever?

24
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,333
What is he talking about?

25
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,500
[GOKU] And I will
rise to claim it!

26
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,375
[GOKU grunts]

27
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:32,708
[GOKU growls]

28
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,125
[GOKU chuckles]

29
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,458
Yeah, I plan on being
stronger than a Super Saiyan!

30
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:38,958
[ROSHI yelps]

31
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,541
What's that?! Did you say
stronger than a Super Saiyan?!

32
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,458
I don't think it
can be done!

33
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:47,916
[ROSHI grunts]

34
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,000
I can do it!

35
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:58,458
It's the only way to beat Cell.

36
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:02,000
And I won't know
if I don't try! Will I?

37
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,166
A year...

38
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,583
To know for sure,
a year's all I'll need.

39
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,750
[ROSHI squeals]

40
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,541
A year?
But that's a long time!

41
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,250
Sure it is! But we
both know a place

42
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,375
where it could
be done in a day!

43
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,375
[ROSHI] Hmm...?

44
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,833
[CHICHI growls]

45
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,708
Hey, ChiChi, I'd like
to take Gohan with me

46
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,000
if that's okay with you!

47
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:26,541
That's a joke, right? Right...?

48
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,750
[GOKU gasps]

49
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,208
Well... What do you
think I'll say, Goku?

50
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:33,666
[CHICHI growls]

51
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,458
Huh? Yeah! Go ahead.
I can't stop you.

52
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,000
But I want you to make sure

53
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,541
Gohan gets as
strong as possible.

54
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,458
...'Kay?

55
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,500
[GOKU] Sure!

56
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,583
Now, if I let Gohan

57
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,291
go and battle those
androids with you,

58
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:52,541
you have to promise to let him
study when he gets back alright?

59
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,208
[ROSHI thinking] Hmm...
Interesting.

60
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:56,416
ChiChi never lets Gohan
put down the books .

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,708
This must be some
kind of a trick.

62
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,000
--[CHICHI giggles]
--[ROSHI gasps]

63
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,291
I want you and Gohan
to give it all you've got!

64
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,958
Thanks, ChiChi...

65
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,208
[thinking] I could never deny
you anything, you big lug!

66
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,333
[CHICHI] Goku, I don't
what I'd do without you.

67
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,500
That's sweet...

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:19,958
[ROSHI stammers]

69
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,333
Well, see you!

70
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,208
[kissing sound]

71
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,958
[GOKU] I'll miss you, ChiChi...

72
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,708
[CHICHI] I'll miss you too...

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,875
[GOKU grunts]

74
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,125
[ROSHI gasps]

75
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,333
He disappeared!
How'd he do that?!

76
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,583
Come back... soon.

77
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,708
Are we there yet, Yamcha?

78
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:01,416
[YAMCHA] Soon.

79
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Well, hurry up!

80
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,375
We don't want Cell
to get away again!

81
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,375
We have to stop him...
And quickly!

82
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,000
[PICCOLO] But we have
to find him first.

83
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,375
Aww... We sure need Goku...

84
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,083
--Now!
--Wha--?!

85
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,625
--That'd be really nice...
--It's my... Dad!

86
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,083
Goku?!

87
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:24,958
Sure would be great
if he'd show up.

88
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,250
It's Daddy!

89
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,125
Goku? Huh?

90
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,583
Hey!

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,208
Yup, I must be losing it.

92
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,125
I'm starting to see things!

93
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,166
[KRILLIN gasps]

94
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,791
Goku?

95
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,541
Hi, Krillin!

96
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,750
Goku!

97
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,833
[KRILLIN laughs]

98
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:47,833
[GOKU] Whoa!

99
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,166
[laughing continues]

100
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,083
Goku! You came back!

101
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,708
[GOKU laughs]

102
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:57,416
[KRILLIN] Uh-oh...
There goes our ride.

103
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,791
[TIEN] Hey, Yamcha, swing her
around and grab those two!

104
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,791
[KRILLIN] I can't believe it!

105
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,083
[GOHAN sighs]

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,166
You're back!

107
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,333
Yeah. So when do we eat?

108
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,666
--Goku! You nut!
--[GOKU laughs]

109
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,583
You're back to
normal alright!

110
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,625
Well... A guy's
gotta eat, right?

111
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,833
[GOHAN whimpers]

112
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,625
[GOKU] Hmm?

113
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,833
[whimpering continues]

114
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,250
[GOKU] Hey, why
the long face, kiddo?

115
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,208
There...

116
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,250
[GOHAN chuckles]

117
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,208
[GOHAN] I missed you, Daddy!

118
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,166
Kamiccolo!

119
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,791
[PICCOLO gasps]

120
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:52,916
Huh?

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,041
[GOKU] What? Did I
say something wrong?

122
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,625
Listen, I've been
through some changes.

123
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,875
But my name is still Piccolo.

124
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,750
And don't forget that!

125
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,208
Sure thing.
No problem!

126
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:08,083
--Well, what?!
--[GOKU laughs]

127
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,833
Uh... Hey, Piccolo...

128
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:12,833
There's no way that we can
defeat a power like Cell

129
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,666
in fight right now.

130
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,583
That's why I decided
to start training again.

131
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,833
And I know a place

132
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,166
where I can get a year
of training in a day!

133
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,458
Where is that?

134
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,333
[GOKU] It's at Kami's place!

135
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,250
So it's back to the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

136
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,791
I see...

137
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,875
No one has ever been able to
stay there for more than a year.

138
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,125
No one. It might be way more
than you can handle, Goku.

139
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,958
Yeah. That's why I'm
taking Trunks and Vegeta.

140
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,500
Surely one of us
will be able to do it.

141
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,625
Then go, quickly!
Cell gets stronger everyday.

142
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,083
And time is in short supply.

143
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:53,833
If we let Cell absorb 17,
we're finished for sure!

144
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:57,625
True. Come on, Gohan!

145
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,833
[GOHAN] Huh?

146
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,833
[GOKU] Take my hand!

147
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:04,250
Right! Let's do it!

148
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:07,458
[GOKU grunts]

149
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,916
Wait. Before you go!

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,416
[GOKU] Hmm?

151
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,291
Hey! Is it true you guys will
be gone for just one day?

152
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:20,750
That's cool. Train
hard. We'll find Cell.

153
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,208
It's a deal.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,250
[PICCOLO thinking] One day
is more than we can afford.

155
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,375
It better be worth it!

156
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,541
Things are looking up! When
those guys are done training

157
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,166
I know we'll be
ready for Cell.

158
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,541
[KRILLIN] You bet!

159
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,333
We'll win. And the Earth
will be safe once again!

160
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:43,750
Man, I just can't wait
to get to Cell now!

161
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,833
His days of terrorizing people
will be over for good!

162
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,708
[thinking] Yes! I can feel it!
I know it can be done!

163
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,708
I can ascend beyond
a Super Saiyan!

164
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,625
The only question is--How?

165
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:33,416
[thinking] Father!
You're so proud and arrogant!

166
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,708
Well, I've got news for you:
I'm not going anywhere!

167
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,791
If you can raise your power to
the next level, then so can I!

168
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:45,166
I'm here to stay whether
you like it or not!

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,875
[TRUNKS gasps]

170
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,541
Go... ku?

171
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,833
[GOKU] Hey, how's the
training going, Trunks?

172
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,125
[TRUNKS grunts]

173
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,625
Not well...

174
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,125
I guess my father really doesn't
want me to train with him.

175
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,791
He thinks I'll slow him down

176
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:08,541
and every time I get close
he tells me to get lost!

177
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,041
Look at him! He's
not doing anything!

178
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,000
He's been standing
in the same spot,

179
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,958
staring into space for
the last three days!

180
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,291
He hasn't moved!

181
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,875
Yeah, that is strange...

182
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,083
Maybe he's just
waiting for a sign

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:24,083
or something to
show him the way. Right?

184
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,125
[TRUNKS] Huh?

185
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,750
[GOKU] I'll go have
a word with him.

186
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,750
Hey! Vegeta!

187
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,958
Kakarot,
leave me alone.

188
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,333
Hey, hold on.

189
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,500
I just want to
help you out, Vegeta!

190
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,083
I know what you're
trying to do!

191
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,708
There's a room at Kami's place

192
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,333
where you can get a year
of training in one day!

193
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
[VEGETA] Hmm...

194
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,666
I could ascend to the
next level very quickly...

195
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,083
Take me there.

196
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:01,041
[GOKU] Sure, but
here's theproblem:

197
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,666
Only two people can
go in the room at once.

198
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,750
I'm going in with Gohan, so
you'll have to go with Trunks.

199
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,958
[VEGETA] This better not be
another one of your tricks!

200
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,541
[GOKU] Hey, would I lie to you?

201
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,958
We're all in this
together now, remember?

202
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,416
This is on the level, I promise!

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,458
[VEGETA] Alright, I'll go!
As long as I get to go first!

204
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,916
Sure!

205
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,083
[GOKU] You know, this is a
great way for a father and son

206
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,583
to get to know each other.

207
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,666
[ANDROID 18] Hmm...
What do we have here?

208
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,958
Ugh! Rubbish!

209
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,083
Maybe this one?

210
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:58,500
Eww, no. I don't think so.

211
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,833
How 'bout this one?

212
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,833
Hmmmm...

213
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,166
Whoever owns these clothes

214
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,416
should have their optic
sensors adjusted.

215
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,041
They are obviously
malfunctioning.

216
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,125
No thanks.

217
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,625
Just look at this place...

218
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,250
What a dump.

219
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,708
I can't believe Goku
actually lives here.

220
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,333
[ANDROID 17] 18!
Any sign of Goku in there?

221
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,875
[ANDROID 18] No.
The house is empty.

222
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,875
Goku's friends must have
warned him that we were coming.

223
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,166
[ANDROID 17] Hmph.

224
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,958
He's gone.

225
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,666
[ANDROID 18] Great.

226
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,083
[ANDROID 17] Can you track him
and find his latest location?

227
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:53,166
It is difficult,
but I will try...

228
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,583
He has moved some
distance from this location.

229
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,708
My tracking mechanism has
not detected his movements

230
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,500
for the last two hours.

231
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:04,958
Okay. Tell us what you know.

232
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:11,000
Alright. Goku, was last detected
on a small island to the south.

233
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,875
[ANDROID 17] Then that's
where we will go.

234
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,583
You're the boss.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,333
[CELL chuckles]

236
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,958
[CELL laughs]

237
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,333
[COUPLE panting]

238
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:32,083
[WOMAN screams]

239
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,416
[COUPLE gasps]

240
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,166
[COUPLE screams]

241
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,833
[CELL growls]

242
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,875
[COUPLE whimpers]

243
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,000
[COUPLE screams]

244
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:11,041
[CELL laughs]

245
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,708
[PICCOLO thinking] They didn't
deserve such a horrible fate...

246
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,416
[YAMCHA sighs]

247
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,750
[YAMCHA] These poor people
never had a chance...

248
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,833
[TIEN whimpers]

249
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,541
[KRILLIN growls]

250
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,708
Darn it! We're always
just one little step behind!

251
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,625
[PICCOLO gasps]

252
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,833
It's Cell!

253
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,833
[CELL] Look at those insects...

254
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,208
I could squash them now,
but I will wait...

255
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,666
I find them very entertaining.

256
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,375
[CELL chuckles]

257
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,750
Please follow me.

258
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,958
You will find everything
you need here...

259
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,500
There's food, a bed, and bath.

260
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:26,125
It is not very luxurious,
I'm afraid.

261
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,166
I require nothing more
than the essentials.

262
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,083
This is not a vacation,
this is work!

263
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,333
[GOKU] Ignore him, Mr. Popo.
he's a little uptight today.

264
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,750
He's just eager to
complete his training.

265
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,625
Yes, so then I can
take care of you!

266
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:49,458
[VEGETA chuckles]

267
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,666
[MR. POPO] Here it is.

268
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:01,916
[GOHAN] Wow! So that's the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber, huh?

269
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,833
[MR. POPO] Alright.
Which group goes first?

270
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:08,000
Hey! You two, go on in.

271
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,375
Good. Right this way, please.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,541
[MR. POPO] Once you
cross the threshold,

273
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,708
you are to spend a
year in the room.

274
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,833
But when you leave, only
a day will have passed

275
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,916
in this dimension.

276
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,541
Good luck.

277
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,666
[TRUNKS] Hmm...

278
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,083
Thank you, Goku.  

279
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:29,833
[GOKU] Good luck, Trunks.
Take care of Vegeta, okay?

280
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,583
[VEGETA growls]

281
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,041
[GOKU chuckles]

282
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,916
I hope those
two get along...

283
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,333
[VEGETA] What's so
special about this place?

284
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,000
It's hot.
There's less air.

285
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:01,125
And the gravity is different.

286
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583
[VEGETA] Hmm...

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,083
What?! I don't believe it!

288
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:11,958
[VEGETA] Hm?

289
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,916
[TRUNKS] There's
nothing here!

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,625
We're surrounded
by total emptiness!

291
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,583
We're floating in a
gigantic void!

292
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,708
[TRUNKS] What kind
of a place is this?

293
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,541
[VEGETA] Too much for you?

294
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,583
Of course not. But...

295
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:40,458
Now, I know why few can stand a
whole year in this place.

296
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:43,916
It's overwhelming!

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,083
It is. It is...

298
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:51,500
[TRUNKS] I must not let my
Father see that I am afraid...

299
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:55,416
This is my chance to
prove myself to him!

300
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,625
But I don't know if I can spend
an entire year in this place...

301
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,208
It's too much for me...

302
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,250
It's too much!

303
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:10,083
[YAMCHA] If we can't sense Cell,
then where is he? He's hiding!

304
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,625
Right?

305
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:15,958
That's what he does. And the
world's a big place to hide in.

306
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,500
So what?! Then we'll just
get out there and find him!

307
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,000
And fast!

308
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,708
If we don't, Cell will take
total control of this world!

309
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,666
[PICCOLO growls]

310
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,916
[PICCOLO] We can
chase Cell all we want,

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,041
but we're going to need Goku,
Vegeta, Gohan and Trunks

312
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,041
to complete their training and
transform into Ascended Saiyans

313
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,208
if we're going to beat him!

314
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,500
[REPORTER ] If you're planning
on going outside today, don't!

315
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,833
The creature sightings
are at an all-time high.

316
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,291
It would be a good day to
stay in, and lock your doors.

317
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,791
These are dangerous times,
folks, and we can only hope

318
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,791
that somewhere there is someone

319
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,333
--who can stop this monster!
--[PICCOLO] I can't stand it!

320
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,500
Sitting here doing nothing

321
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,666
while Cell continues
his reign of terror!

322
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,166
[KRILLIN grunts]

323
00:19:59,250 --> 00:19:59,958
[PICCOLO growls]

324
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,541
[PICCOLO] Curse you, Cell!

325
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,583
[PICCOLO] Hn?!

326
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,083
[PICCOLO gasps]

327
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,916
[ANDROID 17] Hi...
Can Goku come out and play?

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,541
[thinking] Oh, this is perfect!

329
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:19,083
It's exactly what I
wanted for breakfast!

330
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:25,375
Goku is not here.

331
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,208
Not here?

332
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,708
[PICCOLO] Get up!
We have company!

333
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:34,125
[KRILLIN] Huh...? What...?
What's going on?

334
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,750
This better be good...

335
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,125
[PICCOLO] Stand your
ground! I'll handle this!

336
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,416
Goku's not here, but perhaps
I could take his place.

337
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,333
No thanks... But...

338
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,333
Tell us where he is and
I might change my mind!

339
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,958
[KRILLIN] Oh no!
I don't like the look of this!

340
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:55,458
Goku's gone now...
So, why don't you go get lost?

341
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,041
Now, now.

342
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,250
It's not very nice to talk to
your guests that way, you know.

343
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,625
Uh-oh! They look like
trouble with a capital T!

344
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,958
Alright. Have it your way.
There. That island.

345
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,500
You and me.

346
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,291
[ANDROID 17] Very well.
If you really want to.

347
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:22,458
You three stay here.
This is my fight now!

348
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,916
[KRILLIN] Huh?

349
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,000
[ANDROID 18 giggles]

350
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:36,291
Does Piccolo
have a chance?

351
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,500
No way! The odds
are against him!

352
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,291
No, he can do it!

353
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:44,000
He has to, at least
until Goku gets back!

354
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,666
Come on, Piccolo!
You can do it Piccolo!

355
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,208
[ANDROID 16] Hm?

356
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,000
[ANDROID 18] I think it's
my turn to sit this one out.

357
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,250
[ANDROID 18 sighs]

358
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,541
[ANDROID 17] If you cooperate.
I'll go easy on you.

359
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,333
[ANDROID 17 sighs]

360
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,375
[ANDROID 17] Last chance.
Tell me where Goku is.

361
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,375
No. Go find him yourself!

362
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,208
[NARRATOR] It looks like Piccolo
has thrown down the gauntlet.

363
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:43,041
Since uniting with Kami,
he's more powerful

364
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,583
than he's ever been.
But does he have the strength

365
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,791
to beat Android 17?

366
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,958
This could get messy, so don't
miss the next exciting episode

367
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,416
of DragonBall Z!
