00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,958
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,291
the mutating monster, Majin Buu,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
found himself totally outclassed

4
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,541
by Super Saiyan Vegito,

5
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:26,666
the radical warrior formed by
the fusion of Goku and Vegeta!

6
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:34,083
[VEGITO]
Still hungry, Buu?

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,208
Curse you!

8
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,500
Eat this!

9
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,708
[NARRATOR] It was a hard
pill to swallow for Buu,

10
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:46,166
who had dominated
every opponent thus far,

11
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,916
and decimated the entire
population of the Earth!

12
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,000
But to Vegito,

13
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:57,000
an amalgam of the two greatest
Saiyans that ever lived,

14
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,541
the universal giant of evil was
a mere plaything in his hands!

15
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,083
[NARRATOR] The simmering anger
at his own inferiority

16
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,041
worked itself up to a boil

17
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,041
and Majin Buu flew into a rage

18
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,375
that shook the very
foundations of the Universe!

19
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,875
[NARRATOR]
As the temporal boundaries

20
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,416
between dimensions began
to be compromised,

21
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,958
Vegito had to either stop
Buu's radical power surge,

22
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,916
or bear witness
to the destruction

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,458
of the entire physical cosmos!

24
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,333
[NARRATOR]
But in true Saiyan style,

25
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,791
Vegito pierced
Majin Buu's defenses,

26
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:51,833
and prevented the horrible
cataclysm from taking place!

27
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
[VEGITO]
Well, if you ask me,

28
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,500
that was a little too
close for comfort.

29
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,541
But have the decency
to learn your lesson!

30
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,291
There's no way you
can ever beat me!

31
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,375
Unless you'd like to try that
technique you've been saving!

32
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,375
[KING YEMMA]
Huh, huh, ho! This is great!

33
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,416
Pay per view! You can't beat it!

34
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,958
Can you believe that pink
galoot? I mean, that selfish oaf

35
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,833
almost destroyed the
entire physical universe!

36
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,375
[KING YEMMA chuckles]

37
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,458
Not with Vegito there!

38
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:56,375
If it were Goku by himself,
it would be all over by now!

39
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,875
Thank goodness he
has a little help!

40
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,458
Well, King Yemma, it sure
is a lucky coincidence

41
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,416
that you decided to preserve
Vegeta's body, isn't it?

42
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,125
[laughs]

43
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,458
Coincidence?

44
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,750
You're not suggesting
I didn't see this coming,

45
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,416
are you, Baba?

46
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,541
Oh, that's a good one!
You're a funny old witch!

47
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,791
Great King Yemma
didn't get this job

48
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,000
because of strange coincidences!

49
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,291

51
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,541
Well! Forgive me!

52
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:33,583
I guess I was just thinking
you were a brainless bouncer

53
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,375
who knew how to
use a rubber stamp!

Great power! Don't waste it!

60
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,125
What d'ya say that you
try it out on yours truly?

61

Sheesh! What's wrong?

85
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,125
Why is he tempting fate
by toying with Buu?

86
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,500
The fusion with Vegeta must
have skewed Goku's judgment!

87
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,708
He's just too darn arrogant!

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,458
[SUPER BUU groans]

180
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:58,958
--[VEGITO grunting]
--[SUPER BUU groaning]

181
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,375
Come on, Buu.

182
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,916
You're using your eyes
instead of feeling where I am!

183
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:07,541
There's no need to continue!
Why don't you give up?!

184
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,166
Never! Fool!

185
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,125
[SUPER BUU]
You're nothing!

186
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:16,041
Without the fusion, I could
rip both of you apart!

187
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,333
Oh, yeah? Well,
look who's talking!

188
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:22,083
You got your strength from
eating my sons and my friends!

189
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,666
[SUPER BUU]
I'm going to kill you!

190
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,625
[VEGITO] Or at least
make me use my hands!

191
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,166
Oh, that does it!

192
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,208
[SUPER BUU yells]

193
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,708
[DABURA]
Gohan! Gohan!

194
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,666
[BULMA]
Gohan! Come on out! It's us!

195
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:56,125
Gohan! Hey! Son! Where are you?

196
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,500
Gohan! Hello?

197
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,458
It doesn't seem like we're
ever going to find him!

198
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,375
Don't lose hope, dear one!

199
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,625
I, Dabura, will find
your son at all costs--

200
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,625
even if I have to give
up my own life to do it!

201
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,666
Hey, bud!

202
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,083
That's a very
noble of sentiment,

203
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,375
but you are already dead.

204
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,083
You can't give what
you don't have, ya know!

205
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:28,333
[VIDEL]
Gohan still has it! To give!

206
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,625
I really think Gohan
still has it to give!

207
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:38,708
I know! You guys must think I'm
losing it, but I have a feeling!

208
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:42,000
I just don't believe
that Gohan's dead!

209
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,583
Call me crazy! Go ahead!

210
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,875
But I feel like he's
very far away from here!

211
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,375
I can't sense
spirits like he can,

212
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,416
but for some reason,
I just know it's true!

213
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,333
Oh, Videl!

214
00:18:57,416 --> 00:19:00,291
I hope my heart's
not playing tricks on me!

215
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,375
No way! It couldn't be!

216
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,458
There's absolutly
nothing more powerful

217
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,791
than a woman's intuition,
I always say!

218
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:11,333
No harm can come from
wishing that it's true!

219
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,541
Besides, I think you and Gohan
have a special connection!

220
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,375
Gosh! Thank you!

221
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,666
You're deeply in love
with Gohan, aren't you?

222
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,333
Uh-- What? No way!

223
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:27,333
Yes! There's no hiding it!

224
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,291
I can see it written
all over your face, Videl!

225
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,750
So, this is love!
Beautiful, lovely love!

226
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:37,000
Ohhh! Now I've seen
it with my own eyes! Love!

227
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:40,458
The most powerful
force in the world!

228
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,791
[laughs nervously]

229
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,083
[SUPER BUU groans]

230
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,708
You can't even
lay a hand on me,

231
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,875
and yet you still
refuse to admit defeat!

232
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
Your pride is blinding you!

233
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:59,791
Can't you see the writing
that's on the wall!

234
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,458
You're done! Cooked!
It's all over!

235
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,875
Admit that you're
wrong and surrender!

236
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,208
[SUPER BUU thinking]
You wretch!

237
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:12,416
I'll find a way to kill you
if it's the last thing I do!

238
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,833
It's up to you! Do you
want to continue or not?

239
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:22,166
[SUPER BUU thinking] You fool!
I will never surrender to you!

240
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes! There is
still one chance!

241
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,041
Let's go, blondie!
You know you can't win!

242
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,541
That's why you want
me to surrender, right?

243
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:40,416
Ha! Come on! I'm calling
your bluff, coward!

244
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,208
Huh?

245
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,916
What's wrong? Are you chicken?

246
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,291
Yeah, that's it! Let's do it!

247
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,625
[SUPER BUU thinking]
A little closer...

248
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,333
[SUPER BUU]
You're just a paper tiger!

249
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:02,833
If you can finish me off,
let's see it! Come on! Do it!

250
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,208
Fine! Let's end this
thing right now!

251
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,041
I like your style! You're
going to make great candy!

252
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,083
Huh?

253
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:22,250
[screams]

254
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,333
[BOTH gasping]

255
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:28,625
Candy?!

256
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,750
No! Vegeta! Goku!

257
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:46,958
[cackling]

258
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,458
[cackling] Yes!

259
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:53,166
[chanting] Majin Buu!
Big fat Buu!

260
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,875
Take that, sucker!

261
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,750
Yes!

262
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,250
Aaaah! Candy?

263
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,500
You idiots!

264
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:06,958
Bigheaded, arrogant,
no good bums! I knew it!

265
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:12,291
What a lost generation!

266
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,250
They're too full of
themselves to see straight!

267
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,958
[laughing]

268
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,125
Coffee flavored candy!
That's my fave!

269
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:23,583
Should I chew you to bits
or lick you to death?

270
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:31,875
[laughs]

271
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,125
Candy?!

272
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:36,458
Yuk! Why coffee? That's gross!

273
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,458
[NARRATOR]
Through his evil stratagems,

274
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:41,875
Majin Buu has managed to
turn the tides once again!

275
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,375
Is there any hope
for the Earth

276
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,333
now that Vegito has been
turned into a coffee-flavored

277
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,333
Super Saiyan Sucker?

278
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:52,375

episode of Dragon Ball Z!
