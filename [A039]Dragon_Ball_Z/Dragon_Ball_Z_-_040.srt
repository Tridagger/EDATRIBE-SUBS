[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,958
Bulma, Krillin, and
Gohan set out on a quest

3
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,250
for the Dragon Balls
on Planet Namek.

4
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:24,583
But on the way, they ran into
some big trouble... Literally!

5
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:25,375
Oh no!

6
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,625
Bulma!

7
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,958
[NARRATOR] An in-flight
collision should have

8
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,291
spelled doom for the young
travelers, but instead

9
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:33,041
they found themselves
mysteriously transported

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,250
into the belly of
an alien vessel,

11
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,125
where danger lurked
at every turn!

Don't hurt her!

16
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:53,750
Just stay there!
I don't wanna get shot!

17
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,958
Easy now, everyone. We're
not trying to hurt anybody.

18
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,000
[NARRATOR] Now, our heroes
have been surrounded

19
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,791
by what appears to be a
well-equipped army of children!

20
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,125
Who will make the first move
in this bizarre standoff?

Huh?

26
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,708
[GOHAN] Please, listen!
We can explain.

27
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,750
You must have us confused
with someone else.

28
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,166
We're from the planet
Earth. We're friendly!

I don't want to hear your
bogus explanations any more!

31
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,375
Hey, guys c'mon
now... Wait a minute!

32
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,666
We have nothing
against you!

33
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,750
You attacked us so we
had to defend ourselves!

34
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,208
You gotta
believe me!

35
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,791

[KRILLIN shouting]

00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,458
[BULMA] Hey! Why don't you two
try being quiet for a change?!

38
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,000
You're gonna get
us all killed!

39
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,583
Easy now, kids... I'm not
trying to hurt anyone.

40
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,916
[KRILLIN] Gohan,
let's power up.

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,375

Or I'll shoot
you... I swear!

Zeshin, why don't you just
kill them all right now?!

51
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,458
We know they must be
allies with Frieza!

Uh, okay.

53
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,625

on those three!

anything strange,

to start training you

over a tiny needle!

when he
was born.

83
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,125

can fight in epic battles

We are in the middle
of an asteroid field!

leave them here like this!

here, we'll be dead!

is flying this thing?!

Who do you
think you are?!

I'm a pilot! Which means
I DO know what I'm doing.

I think she's a
dirty liar, Boon!

125

[BOON] I know how to
fly this ship!

If you want
to live,

then you're gonna let me
pilot this piece of junk!

Okay, so we've got the
fuel indicator,

and controls for
the lateral jets...

Where is the
speed control?

Look! Either you tell me,
or we're all history!

Nice! I save
your lives,

and what do I get in

143
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:08,250
Yeah, 'cause we still
don't trust you!

144
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,416
And how could we?

145
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,750
You and your friends
are responsible

146
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,083
for destroying
our home!

147
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,750
[BULMA] Look, I think
this is all a big mix-up!

148
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:35,166
So tell me... what friends
are you talking about?

149
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,833
Don't pretend
you don't know!

150
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,291
We're talking about your
homicidal buddy named Frieza!

151
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,541
Frieza?

152
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,000
Bulma!

153
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,375
[BULMA] Krillin, Gohan,
tell them.

154
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,500
These kids... They think we
know some guy named Frieza.

155
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:53,750
We don't think, lady!
We know who you are!

156
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,125
Just look at how strong
your two brothers are!

157
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,083
They think
we're brothers!

158
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,541
No way.

159
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,416
Listen, you've got
this all wrong.

160
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,000
Those two are not
my brothers!

161
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,125
And don't accuse us of
being friends with somebody

162
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,125
that we don't
even know!

163
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,458
[KRILLIN] Bulma, wait!

164
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,208
I say we throw these liars
out of the airlock! Now!

165
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,000
[ZESHIN]
I don't think so.

166
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,500
Zeshin?

167
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,416
It's all right, everyone.
You can put your weapons down.

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,791
Have you lost
your mind?!

169
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,875
These three are
allies with Frieza!

170
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,125
We have to treat them
like a serious threat

171
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,583
and eliminate them!

172
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:25,833
If they're allies
with Frieza,

173
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,416
explain to me why
they chose to help us.

174
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,375
They would have killed us just
like he killed our parents.

175
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,083
These people actually
care about us.

176
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,375
They aren't like
Frieza and his men!

177
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,666
They wouldn't
attack us

178
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,750
in the middle of the
night without warning us!

179
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,208
Get to safety!
Leave us behind!

180
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,000
I remember...

181
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,208
Run, Boon!

182
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,416
[remembering]
Mother! Father, no!

183
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,208
Hide before
they see you!

184
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,666
[screaming]

185
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,791
[evil laughter]

186
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,041
[yelling]

187
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:32,791
I... think we
can trust them.

188
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,541
Boon?

189
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,958
Well, I'm glad you
guys believe us now.

190
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,833
I wonder if the
people who attacked

191
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,125
with Frieza
were Saiyans?

192
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey, do you remember if
the people that conquered

193
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,791
your planet had tails that
came out about this far?

194
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,625
A tail? I didn't see
a tail on any of them.

195
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,625
Oh. Well, so much for that
brilliant theory, Krillin.

196
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,708
That means there's a group
of warriors out there

197
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,916
even more evil
than Saiyans.

198
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,375
What kind of a planet
did you live on?

199
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,583
I mean
before Frieza?

200
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
Our planet
was successful.

201
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:14,000
A truly wonderful and
peaceful place to live.

202
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,541
Until that
terrible night!

203
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,875
When they took
our innocence...

204
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,333
[screaming]

205
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,291
[ZESHIN] It was an ambush.
We never even saw them coming.

206
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,000
When they arrived they
said the planet

207
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,500
now belonged
to Frieza

208
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,583
and anyone who didn't name
him as ruler would be killed.

209
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,458
Most of the people gave in and
professed Frieza as their King,

210
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,083
but the invaders had no
intention of allowing us

211
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,458
to live in the
first place.

212
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,833
They murdered everyone who
came across their path.

213
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,291
Women, children... There was
no limit to the carnage.

214
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,583
It was terrible.

215
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,500
It must have been very
difficult for you to escape.

216
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,041
The few adults who realized
Frieza's true intentions

217
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,875
were able to
cover long enough

218
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,791
for their kids to
make an escape.

219
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,208
Those that were lucky enough to
make it to their ships in time

220
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,916
were eventually
destroyed in space.

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We only avoided
being destroyed

222
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:20,000
because of our
mirrored exterior.

223
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,958
This ship has mirrors
on the outside?

224
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,125
That explains why you
showed up on radar,

225
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,125
yet we couldn't actually
see you with our eyes.

226
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,291
Your people must have
brilliant scientific minds

227
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,041
to create
such a ship.

228
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,375
So, where in the galaxy
are you headed to now?

229
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,000
Anywhere specific?

230
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,375
That's right.
There is a planet

231
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,666
that my father
used to visit

232
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,791
from time to time for
trading purposes.

233
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,333
And I just know that
they will be willing

234
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,291
to accept us
without question.

235
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:51,875
Is this
planet far?

236
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,708
Yes it is. But we're willing,
even if it takes years.

237
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:56,708
Ha, ha!

238
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:59,208
[BOTH chuckling]

239
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,083
Well, good luck
to all of you.

240
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,291
Thanks, guys.
And same to you.

241
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,375
We'll see ya!

242
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,833
[CHILDREN laughing]

243
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,916
Let's go,
boys.

244
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,333
We have a lot of
time to make up,

245
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,083
thanks to this
little detour.

246
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,083
It's okay,
Bulma.

247
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,000
It's not like Namek
is gonna go anywhere.

248
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,375
Wait a minute...

249
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,958
You three are all trying
to get to the planet Namek?

250
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,291
Sure are.
You've heard of it?

251
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,875
I think we passed it
around 2 or 3 weeks ago.

252
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,666
If you head in the
direction of K-5162,

253
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,833
you'll find about a 10
day shortcut to Namek.

254
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:43,458
A shortcut?

255
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,041
U-Uh-huh.

256
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:50,666
So head towards K-5162,
huh? Thank you! Let's go!

257
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,958
[GOHAN chuckling]

258
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,875
Ah! If you take the
shortcut, don't forget--

259
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,958
[BOON] That was an
interesting visit.

260
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,458
Huh, Zeshin?

261
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,541
They turned out to be
nice people after all.

262
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah.

263
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,958
Well... We should
get going ourselves!

264
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:26,500
Sounds good!
You guys ready?

265
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,500
[cheering]

266
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,166
Navigate to planet Namek
through the K-5162 system.

267
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,250
I'm glad they
mentioned that shortcut.

268
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,500
What's the matter?

269
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,625
Oh, I was just wondering
who this Frieza guy is

270
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,041
they kept
talking about.

271
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,375
Well, they said the attackers
weren't Saiyans, right?

272
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:51,000
It just sounded like
something Saiyans would do.

273
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,000
Just forget about
it, Krillin!

274
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,208
Try to get
some sleep.

275
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:57,333
I'll see you guys... 
Whenever I wake up.

276
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,541
[SUBORDINATE 1]
Hey, look.

277
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:18,250
[siren beeping]

278
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,791
[SUBORDINATE 2]
Something's coming.

279
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,666
[beeping continues]

280
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,791
[SUBORDINATE 1] Is it Frieza?!

281
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,958
[SUBORDINATE 2] No! That's
impossible.

282
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:28,000
I think I recognize
that signal.

283
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,000
Of course!
It's Vegeta.

284
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,458
Well, that's
strange, isn't it?

285
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,833
Something must
have happened...

286
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,375
I never got an
arrival report.

287
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes... Control
tower, come in.

288
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:41,000
Vegeta is here.
Prepare for his arrival.

289
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,083
Look! Up there!

290
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,041
There's only one
pod! Where's Nappa?

291
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,208
What is he doing?
He should be out by now!

292
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,583
I'm receiving a very low
life-force reading on him.

293
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,041
What?!

294
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,541
[SUBORDINATE D] Why, he's using
his life support system!

295
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,000
[SUBORDINATE E] Quick! Let's get
him to the treatment center.

296
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,666
[rumbling]

297
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,166
What was that?!

298
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,333
Don't know!

299
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,958
[GOHAN and KRILLIN whimpering]

300
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,916
[KRILLIN] Bulma! Something's
happening to the ship!

301
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,375
[BULMA] Don't worry,
Krillin.

302
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,625
This shortcut takes us through
a recently exploded nebula.

303
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,750
It's just a storm in space.
Don't be a wimp.

304
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,666
I mean really,
how can she sleep

305
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,291
through all
this shaking?

306
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,708
[screaming]

307
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:39,666
[thunder]

308
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,416
[distant thunder]

309
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,541
I think
it stopped.

310
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,416
[BULMA] Huh?

311
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,208
Uh?

312
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,916
[KRILLIN] Uhh...

313
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,958
[bonk]

314
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:56,666
That was really
uncalled for, Bulma!

315
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,833
Don't you ever lay your hands
on me again while I'm sleeping!

316
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,791
No, Bulma! It looked a lot
worse than it really was.

317
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,083
I know what I saw!

318
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,250
And I'm sure I
didn't fall asleep

319
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,250
while lying
in Krillin's lap!

320
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,541
[BULMA gasps]

321
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,625
[BULMA laughing]

322
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:15,125
Woah, that looks
like it hurts a lot.

323
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,333
[BULMA] Guys!
Check this out!

324
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:20,625
Yes! It's Namek!
We finally made it!

325
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,708
That sure was a fast
trip, huh, guys?

326
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,958
If it weren't for
that shortcut,

327
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:29,583
we'd only be
halfway there.

328
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,583
Are you
sure that's...

329
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,083
Planet Namek?

330
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,375
Trust me, it's the
right planet!

331
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:38,041
Now, let's go and find
those Dragon Balls!

332
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,500
[NARRATOR] Bulma believes they
have arrived at planet Namek,

333
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,875
though Krillin and Gohan
have their doubts.

334
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,083
They're about to discover
whose hunch is correct

335
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:52,375
as they prepare for their
landing. What mysteries await?

336
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,333
Find out, on the
next Dragon Ball Z!
