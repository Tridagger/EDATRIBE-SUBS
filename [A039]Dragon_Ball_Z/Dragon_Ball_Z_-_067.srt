[NARRATOR Last time
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,375
Things looked bad
for Gohan and Krillin,

3
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,000
as they fell before the Ginyu
Force's first wave of attack.

4
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,125
But then, at their
darkest moment,

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:29,208
a light arrived to bring hope
to the young warriors...

6
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,375
A light that has traveled
across the galaxy from Earth,

7
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,041
bringing with it a warrior
determined to defend

8
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,166
his friends and
family at any cost.

9
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,375
A hero that has trained
himself in extreme conditions,

10
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,458
and overcome
impossible opposition

11
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,708
to bring himself
to this very place,

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,000
ready to face the most
difficult challenge

13
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,791
he has ever
encountered.

14

[NARRATOR} This Saiyan
fighter's strength and power

15
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,166
are matched only by his
determination and will

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,625
to stand up and
face the evil

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,958
that threatens to put an end
to everything he believes in.

18
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,500
The last line of defense
for his friends,

19
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,250
his family, and the
planet Earth...

20
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
[NARRATOR] A warrior
named... Goku.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,458
[NARRATOR] Armed with training
in one hundred times gravity

22
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,333
and a bag of
Senzu beans,

23
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,875
Goku would soon find
out whether or not

24
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,875
all of his efforts
had been in vain.

25
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,791
[KRILLIN chuckles]

26
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,208
[NARRATOR] The proud father
and friend took a few moments

27
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,625
to revive Gohan and Krillin,
before engaging in battle.

28
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,250
Whaa--?!

29
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,416
[GOKU] Your mom'd kill me if
she saw how dirty you are...

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,958
Hah! Yeah, right! You've
gotta be kidding me!

31
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,875
[BURTER] Don't sweat it!
His power level

32
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,375
is only five thousand!

33
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,708
[NARRATOR] Recoome stood ready
to defeat this unknown intruder,

34
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,958
but Goku was
not intimidated.

35
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:13,500
You'll never even
touch me. Not one finger.

36
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:18,625
[VEGETA] No... Is
he... C-Could he be?!

37
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,000
[RECOOME] 'Cause I'm about
to send all you little wimps

38
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,458
straight to hell!

39
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,500
Dodge this, punk!

40
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,833
Here it comes!
Full power!

41
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,000
Eraser Gun!

42
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,500
[RECOOME grunts]

43
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:44,166
[groaning]

44
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,625
[NARRATOR] One swift attack
was all Goku needed

45
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,958
to put an end to the
rampaging Recoome...

46
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,000
But the members of
the Ginyu Force

47
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,750
weren't the only
ones awestruck

48
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,416
by this unprecedented
show of strength!

49
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,541
Vegeta's worst fears
may be coming true!

50
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:02,791
Has Goku really become the
legendary Super Saiyan?

51
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:09,208
No... Is he... You do
not deceive my eyes!

52
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,583
[NARRATOR] The battle
continues today!

53
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:38,416
[RECOOME groans softly]

54
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,166
[GOKU] You two!
I'm warning you!

55
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,208
Leave this planet now
and don't ever come back!

56
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,625
I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.

57
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,000
And if it comes to
that, I promise you

58
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,083
that you'll both be joining
your friend here on the ground.

59
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:21,916
Understand me?

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,750
[JEICE chuckles]

61
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,916
Oy... Did you
hear that, Burter?

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,750
This guy gets in
one lucky punch

63
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,208
and he thinks he can
take on the Ginyu Force!

64
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,791
Yeah, Jeice! I think he
must have hit himself

65
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,458
in the head pretty hard
when he landed here.

66
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,000
He caught Recoome by
surprise, that's all.

67
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:43,000
That doesn't make him
tough, just lucky... Right?

68
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,208
Right... I'm surprised
he got a punch in at all.

69
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,875
This guy's power level
is way too pathetic

70
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,708
to be a challenge...

71
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,750
Man, I don't
like this at all!

72
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,416
We better get
ready, Gohan!

73
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,750
[GOHAN] Right!
C'mon, Dad...

74
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,666
[JEICE] Hmph.

75
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,125
[BURTER] Yeah-ha.

76
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,583
[BOTH grunt]

77
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,875
Now! Say hello to
the Ginyu Force!

78
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,208
Jeice!

79
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,333
I'm your
worst nightmare!

80
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,958
Prepare yourself
for... Burter!

81
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,250
You wanna dance,
or fight?

82
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,916
Do it,
Kakarot...

83
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,375
Ready?! Set! Go!

84
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,666
[BOTH shouting]

85
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,458
[BOTH shout]

86
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,000
[BURTER] Feel it!

87
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,458
[JEICE] Yaaah!

88
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,166
[JEICE gasps]

89
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,583
[JEICE] Burter!

90
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,583
[BURTER] What?!

91
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:36,666
What's the deal
with this guy?

92
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,875
He won't even
make a move!

93
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:38,833
I don't
know, Jeice!

94
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,458
I guess he's
scared stiff!

95
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:45,166
Gotcha! I'll bet the poor
guy is shaking in his boots!

96
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,125
Man! I don't
understand this!

97
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,791
Is Goku just gonna
stand there

98
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,291
and leave himself open
for their attack?

99
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,125
Hey! Yo, Jeice!
This guy's a sitting duck!

100
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,458
Go ahead and
put it to him!

101
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,708
Right! You take
the lead, Burter,

102
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,625
and I'll be right
behind you.

103
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,041
Haah!

104
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,208
[JEICE] Awh yeaah!
Ha, ha, ha! Yeah! Yeah!

105
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,291
Goku! No!

106
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,958
[thinking] Incredible!

107
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,041
If I wasn't seeing
this with my own eyes...

108
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,208
I've had
enough of this!

109
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,541
Think it's time to throw
some pain on the barbie!!

110
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:52,291
I'm sick of your little
games! We are the Ginyu--

111
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,041
[JEICE screams]

112
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,041
[BURTER gasps]

113
00:09:54,125 --> 00:10:02,791
[JEICE wailing]

114
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,375
How... dare you!

115
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,166
[JEICE whimpers]

116
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,166
Hmm? How dare I what?

117
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,166
Weren't the two of you
just trying to attack me?

118
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,291
Why, you! I'll...
I'll destroy you!!

119
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,333
Haaah!

120
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,833
[gasping]

121
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,541
He's...

122
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,000
...dead meat!

123
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,750
[GOKU yells]

124
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,375
[JEICE screams]

125
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,166
There's... no way!

126
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,250
Where did he get that power?!

127
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:14,916
He just channeled his power
into some sort of blast!

128
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
[FRIEZA laughs]

129
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,333
The audacity of
those foolish Namekians.

130
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,666
Do they truly think they can
outsmart the great Frieza?

131
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,208
Well, we'll just
see about that...

132
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,500
This little snag has only
postponed the inevitable.

133
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,291
Very soon...

134
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,541
I'll beat the secret to
using the Dragon Balls

135
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,833
out of one of
those Namekian pests.

136
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,916
And then nothing will stop
me from making my wish!

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,666
[FRIEZA cackles]

138
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:43,416
[GURU snores softly]

139
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,083
Oh, Guru...

140
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,375
[DENDE thinking] It's been
quite a while since Nail left.

141
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,333
I wonder what's going on?
I feel so helpless...

142
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,000
[thinking] Please, Nail...
They need our help. Hurry!

143
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,958
[GINYU] Gentlemen! You
can't make it as a Ginyu

144
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,375
on brute strength alone!

145
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,583
A Ginyu must be able to
showcase his grandeur

146
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,541
and fabulous strength
in a variety of poses!

147
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,791
Now! It's your turn!

148
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,041
I want to see you men
strike a pose! Watch!

149
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:19,041
Captain Ginyu!
Got it?!

150
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,833
You look like a bunch
of hood ornaments!

151
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,541
The purpose of
striking a pose

152
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,250
is not to become
like wallpaper!

153
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,291
That's why we chant
loudly when we pose!

154
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,041
To draw attention to
our magnificence!

155
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:34,416
Hmm... I know! I'll just have to
raise the stakes a little bit.

156
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,291
The best poser gets a
candy... Now do it! Let's go!

157
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,750
Ginyu!

158
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,666
[stammering]

159
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,166
Strock, here!

160
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,208
Captain Strong!

161
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,583
Goose!

162
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,750
Oggers!

163
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,000
Sound off!

164
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,458
[ALL] Now! Feel the power...

165
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,333
[GINYU] ...of The Ginyu Force!

166
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,166
Hrrgh...

167
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,250
So, you're a
captain, too?

168
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,708
[GINYU] There's only one
Captain of the Ginyu Force,

169
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,041
and that's me!

170
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,916
Idiot! You touched
a Dragon Ball!

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,583
[HENCHMAN whimpering]

172
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,791
[GINYU] Didn't I specifically
say before starting this try-out

173
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:28,208
not to touch any of the
Dragon Balls? Well? Didn't I?!

174
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,083
[whimpering]

175
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,000
Y-Yes!

176
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,125
And did you?

177
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,958
Well, uh... Y-Yes...

178
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,708
Okay...

179
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,166
[HENCHMAN screams]

180
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,833
Congratulations,
gentlemen.

181
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,291
You've managed to
survive the first cut.

182
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,458
[sighing]

183
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,916
[GINYU] But...

184
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm afraid
try-outs are over.

185
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,791
[ALL whimpering]

186
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,791
You're all tough
guys, that's true,

187
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:10,500
but, you lack the one thing
that sets all Ginyu's apart...

188
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,416
[GINYU chuckles]

189
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,750
Style!

190
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,500
[GINYU laughs]

191
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,125
[GINYU] Oh, oh, and
gentlemen, one more thing:

192
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,708
Run for your lives!

193
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,958
[ALL whimpering]

194
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:29,208
[blows landing,
screaming]

195
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
[GINYU] Don't feel
ashamed men!

196
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,458
I give the same farewell card
to everyone who tries out

197
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:38,208
for the Ginyu Force
and doesn't make it!

198
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,083
And remember...

199
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,625
[screaming]

200
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,208
[GINYU] Style!

201
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:42,833
[screaming]

202
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,958
[GINYU laughs]

203
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,791
[BURTER shouts]

204
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,791
[JEICE shouts]

205
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,833
[JEICE yells]

206
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,000
[thinking] What is
with this guy?

207
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,083
[thinking] Burter and I are
coming at him from every angle,

208
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,583
but he's not dodging!
He's not even lifting a finger!

209
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,375
[thinking] He's really
pissing me off!

210
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,250
You know, Krillin, I just
don't think these guys

211
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:04,291
are as powerful as we
thought they were.

212
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:08,000
My Dad hasn't
even fought back.

213
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,750
I'm not
so sure...

214
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:18,791
[thinking] No one ignores
me like that! No one!

215
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:24,375
[JEICE yells]

216
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,625
Haaah...

217
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,500
[VEGETA growls]

218
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,458
Hah! Urgh!

219
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,375
Hurgh! Hgh!

220
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,708
No way! They can't
even touch him!

221
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,000
His speed is incredible!
I hardly see him moving!

222
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,875
Those two guys are
about to find out

223
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,875
how powerful Goku
is the hard way.

224
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,666
I... I don't know...

225
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,041
It's two against one and
they're both so strong.

226
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,958
I don't understand!
His power level is only 5000!

227
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:08,458
I'm sure of it! But my
attacks don't even faze him!

228
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:09,916
It's obvious
that Kakarot

229
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,833
is raising his power
level so quickly

230
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,625
that they aren't
able to detect it!

231
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:15,458
He's not even
breaking a sweat!

232
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,916
It's unbelievable! How did he
become so strong so fast?

233
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,083
Those scouters
won't help them.

234
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,583
Even if they knew
his power level,

235
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,583
they still wouldn't
be able to stop him...

236
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,875
But where did
this power come from?!

237
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:34,041
I must know! If there is a way
to become a Super Saiyan,

238
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,666
I must
find it out!

239
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,750
Argh... That punk... No one
makes a fool of Burter

240
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:45,000
and lives to tell
about it. Hey, Jeice!

241
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,791
It's time for the
Purple Spiral Flash Attack!

242
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:53,416
The Purple Spiral Flash,
huh? Hmph. Good idea...

243
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,958
Right, Burter!
Let's do it! Now!

244
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,375
[BURTER] Right!

245
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:04,958
[BURTER growling]

246
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:10,375
[JEICE growling]

247
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,833
[BOTH shouting]

248
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,166
Haaaah!

249
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,666
Ah! What's happening?

250
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,958
I've had it!

251
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,208
[BULMA growls]

252
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,541
[BULMA] What do they
think they're doing,

253
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,541
leaving me here alone like
this?! It's inexcusable!

254
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,375
This is not how
to treat a lady!

255
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,958
This place is
ruining my complexion!

256
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,375
The first thing
they're gonna do

257
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,375
when they get back
is take me home!

258
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,541
Don't they have any idea how
weak and defenseless I am?

259
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,541
I'm too
delicate for this!

260
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,375
I miss Earth...

261
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,416
[BULMA screams]

262
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,958
Somebody get
me outta here!

263
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,416
[BURTER growls]

264
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,458
[JEICE] We didn't
even touch him!

265
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,833
[BURTER] Jeice, come in.
Jeice, do you hear me?

266
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,000
[JEICE] Yeah, Burter!
I got you!

267
00:20:57,083 --> 00:21:00,541
I've got a new plan... Use
the Fire Crusher Ball, right?

268
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,791
When you
fire it,

269
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,208
I'm sure he'll jump out
of the way to evade it.

270
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,958
[JEICE] That's your plan?!

271
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,166
[BURTER} I wasn't through!
When he jumps,

272
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,208
I'll sneak in and
crush him from behind.

273
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,416
He might
be fast,

274
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,625
but I'm the fastest
warrior in the universe!

275
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,125
Gotcha, mate...

276
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,416
This is what you get for
messing with the Ginyu.

277
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,416
[JEICE grunts]

278
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,333
Crusher!

279
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,916
Ball!

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,375
[grunts]

281
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,750
Dodge, you punk!

282
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,000
Jump, now!
What are you doing?!

283
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,041
[gasping]

284
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,000
He deflected it!

285
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,958
Damn you!

286
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:03,416
Huh?! Uhh... Hello?

287
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,625
[JEICE gasps]

288
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:20,250
Hey! Uh... Where did he go?

289
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,000
Look out!
Behind you!

290
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,458
[BURTER screams]

291
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,250
[BURTER] Be merciful...

292
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:39,750
Hi!

293
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,875
[NARRATOR] Goku certainly
seems to have the upper hand,

294
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,958
but the battle has
only just begun!

295
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,708
Could Vegeta
be right?

296
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,250
Has Goku, through
training and sheer will,

297
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,375
become a thing of legend?
A Super Saiyan?

298
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:55,333
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
