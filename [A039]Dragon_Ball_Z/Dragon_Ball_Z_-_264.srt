1
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,666
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,166
an incredible force
descended from the sky!

3
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,750
Piccolo and the boys
thought it was Goku,

4
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:24,791
but it was none other
than his son, Gohan!

5
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,291
[GOTEN]
Gohan!

6
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,583
[NARRATOR] And with the
confidence of his father,

7
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,250
Gohan arrived at the
scene to fight Majin Buu,

8
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,958
the seemingly invincible enemy

9
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,000
who had annihilated the entire
population of the Earth!

10
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:45,458
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

11
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,625
So, hot shot,
you want to fight Majin Buu?

12
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:52,083
[GOHAN] Fight you?
No, I wanna kill you!

13
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,416
[yells]

14
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
[SUPER BUU groans]

15
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,000
[GOHAN yells]

16
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,541
[NARRATOR] And without
even transforming into

17
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:09,791
a Super Saiyan, Gohan took
control of the battlefield

18
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,166
in commanding fashion!

19
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:17,541
[GOHAN]
Hi, nice day!

20
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,583
[NARRATOR] Yes, it was a nice
day to subdue the subduer,

21
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,041
to destroy the destroyer!

22
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:26,875
Majin Buu's evil deeds had
finally come back to haunt him!

23
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:29,958
But is the battle really over?

24
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,208
[gasping]

25
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,958
[GOHAN]
What's the matter, Booboo?

26
00:03:54,041 --> 00:04:01,000
Buu! Not Buu-buu! Fool!
I'll kill you all!

27
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,541
[GOTEN]
Did you hear that?

28
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,958
Yeah! I wish he
wouldn't have said that!

29
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:11,208
Be careful, boys! He looks
like he's about to blow!

30
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,500
[SUPER BUU growling]

31
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:20,208
You! You're dead!
No one mocks me!

32
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,333
[screams]

33
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,375
[chuckles]

34
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,750
[SUPER BUU screaming]

35
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,541
[TRUNKS, GOTEN, PICCOLO scream]

36
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,875
[grunting]

37
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,916
[GOHAN gasps]

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
[ALL gasp]

39
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,041
[growls]

40
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,208
[GOHAN grunts]

41
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,750
[SUPER BUU gags]

42
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,750
[screams]

43
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,083
[chuckles]

44
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,750
[groaning]

45
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,708
[ALL cheering]

46
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,166
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Oh, yeah!

47
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,625
Give it up, you can't win!

48
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,166
[SUPER BUU]
So, it's you.

49
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,375
Huh?

50
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:55,208
[SUPER BUU]
I've known about you all along.

51
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,833
[GOHAN] What? What are
you talking about?

52
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:03,166
[SUPER BUU chuckles]

53
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,541
I mean I've been expecting you,

54
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:09,250
ever since I started
fighting those little brats.

55
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,250
[SUPER BUU]
Even while I was fighting,

56
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:17,166
I could sense your power
in a far away place.

57
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,833
Could feel it growing!

58
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:25,416
I knew you'd be coming here.
Opposites attract one another.

59
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,916
[SUPER BUU laughs]
Yes! Yes!

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,375
I've been waiting
for you the whole time!

61
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:43,500
I can't let a power
greater than mine exist.

62
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,541
Oh, yeah? Well, I understand
your feelings are hurt,

63
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,791
but I don't think
you have much of a choice.

64
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:53,583
It would seem that the scales
are tipped in my favor.

65
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,458
[SUPER BUU grunts]

66
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,958
He's known about
Gohan all along.

67
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,916
He was merely using his fight
with Gotenks as a warm up.

68
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,541
Uh, oh! What if he's
hiding his real power?

69
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,750
Goodbye. Enough is enough!

70
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,250
[growls]

71
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:17,333
Now you'll see what
happens to those I hate!

72
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:20,708
Stupid boy, you will pay!

73
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,125
[screams]

74
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,916
Yes! You're going to pay
for everything you did to me!

75
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:34,750
[screaming]

76
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,666
[continues screaming]

77
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,166
Go ahead, make me pay,

78
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,041
but if that's all
the power you've got,

79
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,750
you're gonna have a lot
of trouble collecting.

80
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,958
You're missing the point.

81
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:01,875
Huh?

82
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:13,833
[SUPER BUU chuckling]

83
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,791
[laugthter continues]

84
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:32,250
Oh, no!

85
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,000
[ALL gasp]

86
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,458
[SUPER BUU yells]

87
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,041
[BEE whimpers]

88
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,750
Just hang in there, Bee!

89
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,875
Uh... Hm?!

90
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,083
Bee, look! A saloon that
hasn't been destroyed!

91
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:53,833
[BEE barks]

92
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,166
Yes! Whoohoo!

93
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,541
Ahhh! Pure gold!

94
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,000
[BEE whines]

95
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
That's right, boy!
We did it!

96
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,083
We found the old
oasis in the desert!

97
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,208
[MR. SATAN] Aw, you're next,
pup! Don't worry!

98
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:20,000
[sighs, yells]

99
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,083
Now what?!

100
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,083
[sighs]

101
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:57,291
[sobs]

102
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,041
[BOTH sigh]

103
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,000
[sputtering]

104
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:09,208
[MR. SATAN] He... He hasn't
stopped destroying things yet?!

105
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,500
[BEE barks]

106
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:25,750
Whoa, look at that hole.
Thanks, Gohan.

107
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,958
Sure.

108
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,541
Oh, wow, we would'a died!

109
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,125
No kidding! It's gigantic!

110
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,208
That was really awesome, Gohan!

111
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,250
How did you know that he
was gonna to blow himself up?

112
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,125
[GOHAN]
I'm not so sure he did.

113
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,041
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
What?!

114
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,291
[PICCOLO]
Quiet!

115
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,000
--[BOYS] But we thought--
--[PICCOLO] Quiet!

116
00:10:56,875 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, what do you think?
Is he dead?

117
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:00,791
No way.

118
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,333
[TRUNKS, GOTEN]
Huh?

119
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,916
But he blew himself up! He was
trying to take you with him.

120
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,666
Yeah, that's exactly what he
wanted us to believe all right,

121
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,583
but that freak is still
out there somewhere.

122
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,208
[PICCOLO]
Are you positive?

123
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,083
I can't sense him.
There's no signal.

124
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,750
That's true, but he
must be masking it.

125
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,583
Hey, that means
he might be ambushing us.

126
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:27,791
Could be. He's obviously
planning something.

127
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,791
Hey! It doesn't matter
if he's alive, Gohan's here!

128
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,000
What are we worried about?

129
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:47,291
--This here's the man!
--[GOTEN] Mm hm!

130
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,208
Even we were stronger than Buu
when we were Super Gotenks!

131
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,458
[TRUNKS laughs]

132
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,250
[GOTEN]
No, we were about the same.

133
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,208
Really? Yeah,
I guess you're right!

134
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,125
Well, at least
Gohan can beat him.

135
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,583
[GOTEN]
Yeah!

136
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:11,708
Oh, by the way, how did you
manage to get so strong?

137
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,541
[PICCOLO chuckles]

138
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,500
[PICCOLO]
So breaking the Z Sword

139
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,583
turned out to be a
blessing in disguise.

140
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,000
[GOHAN]
Exactly.

141
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,750
[PICCOLO] It's strange how
things work out sometimes.

142
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,208
[GOHAN]
Yeah.

143
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,666
Hey, I just realized,

144
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,833
we're gonna be needing
the Dragon Radar.

145
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:54,416
Oh, well I had it, but then
I gave it to Piccolo. Right?

146
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,541
Yes, that's right, but I think
it's in my other pants pocket.

147
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:03,583
Only it doesn't make a
bit of a difference, guys.

148
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,333
Dende's gone, remember?
The balls are inert.

149
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:10,833
Uh! Does that mean
that they don't work?

150
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,166
[PICCOLO]
Mmm!

151
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:17,958
Wait a second, I think
we're jumping the gun a bit.

152
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,791
Feel it? It's faint,
but it's still there.

153
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,125
What?

154
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:29,583
Ahh! You're right,
Gohan! I sense him.

155
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,666
Mm! I can, too!

156
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,500
--Yeah! Me, too!
--[BOTH laugh]

157
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,833
Great! Whatd'ya say
we go track down Dende,

158
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:41,083
before our friend
Majin Buu beats us to it?

159
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,958
Sounds good, let's go.

160
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,000
[TRUNKS] Did you get
a whiff of that? Ugh.

161
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,916
[GOTEN]
Smells like BO.

162
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,541
It's Piccolo!

163
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,416
We shouldn't have to fly at the
back just because we're younger.

164
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,375
It's not fair.

165
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,375
Hm?

166
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,041
What's up? Do you see something?

167
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:15,500
Yeah, there's a man, and a dog.

168
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,708
[grunting]

169
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,250
[panting]

170
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,625
This must be the punishment for
all the lies I told in my life,

171
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,875
of fame and fortune and women!

172
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:35,333
Sorry you have to
be here with me, Bee.

173
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:41,458
Oh, it's him, huh? We're not
gonna help that guy, are we?

174
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:45,291
He's a cheater,
and he lies a lot, too.

175
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,750
Yes, but I think that
he's paid his dues.

176
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,208
Deep down, he's a decent guy.

177
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,291
I've been keeping
tabs on the man lately.

178
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,750
I don't think I can
go on anymore, Bee!

179
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:01,375
I give up. Angels,
just take me away.

180
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,125
[screaming]

181
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,791
[groaning]

182
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,958
[MR. SATAN] No, angel of death,
I take it back!

183
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:20,125
[MR. SATAN sputters]

184
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,333
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?!

185
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:26,416
Hey! It's you, Videl's friend!

186
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,625
Hey there Mr. S!

187
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,583
[MR. SATAN]
Uh, hi. Uh, thanks for the lift.

188
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,541
There's still one thing
that I can't quite figure out.

189
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,541
[GOHAN]
What's that?

190
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:45,291
How Dende managed to survive.

191
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:48,375
Buu had ample time
to hunt him down.

192
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,458
Huh?

193
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,583
[PICCOLO]
When Buu gave us the slip,

194
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,791
it was quite some time

195
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,291
before we managed to
catch up with him again.

196
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,458
So, even if Dende got away,

197
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,875
it seems Buu would've found him.

198
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,083
I see, but you guys
were fighting

199
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,875
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber,
weren't you?

200
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,416
So to you, a good while
passed before you got out,

201
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,916
but on the outside,

202
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,250
that same amount of time would
equate to a couple minutes,

203
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,500
would it not?

204
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,375
[PICCOLO]
Yes, that's it!

205
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,500
It's obvious! Why didn't I think
of that myself? I'm such a fool!

206
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,875
I guess I let the stress
get to my head.

207
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,500
[MR. SATAN screaming]

208
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,291
Sorry, my friend
got carried away.

209
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,458
Whew! Thank you.

210
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,208
[TRUNKS] Don't worry about it,
it was nothing.

211
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,625
Huh?! Oh, wow! There he is!

212
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,083
[MR. SATAN screams]

213
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,916
[TRUNKS]
You guys, it's Dende!

214
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,541
[gasps]

215
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:48,583
[GOHAN]
Hey!

216
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,166
[DENDE]
Hi, everyone!

217
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,458
[PICCOLO]
Dende!

218
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,041
[DENDE]
Hi, Piccolo!

219
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,916
You're alive, I don't know how
you did it. You did well, kid!

220
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,708
--[GOHAN, TRUNKS laugh]
--[MR. SATAN groans]

221
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,291
Thanks, but if it
wasn't for Mr. Popo,

222
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:05,333
I never would've escaped.

223
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,500
Buu came out of the Time
Chamber through a small hole.

224
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,291
He was in liquid form.

225
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,000
--[BULMA whimpers]
-- Gross!

226
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,708
--Huh?!
--[DENDE gasps]

227
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,666
How 'bout chocolate?

228
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,583
[POPO]
Quickly!

229
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,875
No guardian, no Dragon Balls!

230
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:31,541
[DENDE]
Huh?! Ah!

231
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,375
Mm. Brave, Popo.

232
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:39,333
Let's just make sure that
his sacrifice wasn't in vain.

233
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,208
You two should be
proud of yourselves.

234
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,333
It was a very wise move.
You're a fine guardian, Dende.

235
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,500
--[GOTEN laughs]
--[DENDE] Thank you, Piccolo.

236
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,625
That scrawny, green elf-boy,

237
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,541
is he some kind of
bodyguard or somethin'?

238
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:59,041
You oaf! He's no bodyguard!
He's Guardian of the Earth.

239
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,583
Huh?! Really, I'll be darned!

240
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,791
So, where's the radar now?

241
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,208
Piccolo's other pants!

242
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,791
[GOHAN, GOTEN, TRUNKS laugh]

243
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,416
[inaudible]

244
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,750
Phew!

245
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,750
Goku! What do they
intend to do with the balls?

246
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,458
How will they
utilize the wishes?

247
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:23,750
[GOKU]
I'm not sure.

248
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:28,250
Hm. Doesn't this generation
know how to plan?

249
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:33,375
My goodness!
Do I have to do everything?

250
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,666
[MR. SATAN]
What?!

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,375
M-M-M-My sweet,
little Videl is dead?

252
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:43,958
[BEE whines]

253
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,625
[MR. SATAN]
My poor Videl!

254
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,500
How could Buu do that
to her? Darn him!

255
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,875
He was my friend!

256
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,291
[cries] Huh?!

257
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,583
What's wrong with you?

258
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,500
Why didn't you protect
my little girl, huh?

259
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,916
What kind of boyfriend
are you, huh, pal?

260
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,666
I wasn't there!

261
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,708
Hey, don't worry, Sir.
She'll come back to life.

262
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,083
Huh? What are you talkin' about?

263
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,583
She's dead, you little imp!

264
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,791
How you gonna bring
her back to life?

265
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,958
[laughing]

266
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:20,125
No joking around. This is my
daughter we're talking about!

267
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,583
[GOTEN]
I'm not joking!

268
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,291

Hmm?

[surprised grunts]

270
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,166
Buu! He's coming back!

271
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,750
[GOHAN]
That didn't take long.

272
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,916
What? Majin Buu's here?

273
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:42,375
It's him! But why? Surely he
doesn't want to fight Gohan.

274
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:45,916
Unless he's managed to
improve in the last hour.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,250
[ALL gasping]

276
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,541
Alright, I'm gonna go see
what he's up to.

277
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,458
Don't get sucked into
the fight, you guys. Stay here.

278
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,500
[GOHAN]
Why is he back so soon?

279
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,125
What could've changed?

280
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,583
[TRUNKS]
Come on!

281
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,083
[MR. SATAN]
Huh?!

282
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:31,041
Hey! Majin Buu!

283
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:35,541
How dare you hurt my daughter!
What's wrong with you?

284
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:39,041
You promised not to
kill anymore, remember?

285
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,250
[SUPER BUU laughing]

286
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:45,750
What? Don't you
know who I am, Buu?

287
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:49,541
Wake up! The Buu you made
friends with is gone.

288
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,166
Huh? Oh, hey! It's Bee!

289
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:58,208
You remember Bee, don't ya?
This is the puppy you saved.

[SUPER BUU chuckles]

291
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,583
All right, you gave it a try,

292
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,375
now back off. Let Gohan
handle it from here.

293
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,791
[growls] Huh?!

294
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:16,625
We'd better be quiet, Bee.

295

296
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,875
[GOHAN thinking]
I don't get it.

297
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,916
I'm not sensing any
difference from before.

298
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,333
What's he up to?

299
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,666
His power level's
still the same.

300
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,166
Hey, I'll bet he's
bluffing, guys.

301
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,083
Ten to one, he runs away again.

302
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:56,416
Come on then, little worms.
I want to fight you now!

303
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,916
No way!

00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,041
That is not gonna happen.

You're fighting me, Buu.
You got it?

00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:04,708
[SUPER BUU laughs]

308
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,291
I have a score to
settle with them first!

309
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,291
Then I'll take care of you,
stupid boy!

310
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,708
Sorry, pal,

311
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,250
but you're not the one
making the rules around here.

312
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,291
If you wanna fight someone,
then I'm your man.

313
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,666
What happened boys? Don't tell
me you're scared to fight Buu.

[TRUNKS, GOTEN growl]

315
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,541
You were raring to go before,

316
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:30,125
but now that your friend showed
up, you're acting like cowards.

317

Come on!

00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,916
[NARRATOR] Ignoring the
obvious rematch with Gohan,

Majin Buu has challenged
Goten and Trunks to do battle!

320
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:47,041
What tricks does the insidious
Buu have up his sleeve,

321
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,125
or rather, under his back?
