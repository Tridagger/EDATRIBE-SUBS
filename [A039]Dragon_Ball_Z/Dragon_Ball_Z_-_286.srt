00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,333
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,666
Vegeta decided to
stick to the fighting

3
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,958
and let Goku do the talking.

4
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,541
[GOKU]
We need your energy now!

5
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,166
Raise your hands up!
I beg of you!

6
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,500
[NARRATOR] Many old friends
offered up their energy

7
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,416
when they heard Goku's plea!

8
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
But the mass of
humanity didn't join in

9
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,708
until their beloved
champion, Mr. Satan,

10
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,958
asked them to lend a hand!

11
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:38,791
[CROWD]
Satan! Satan!

12
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,791
Satan! Satan!

13
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,041
[NARRATOR] At last the wall of
skepticism was knocked down

14
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:47,625
and mankind was freely offering
their collective energy

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,333
to help beat the Buu!

16
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,208
[NARRATOR]
Out it poured from the Earth,

17
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,416
arriving like a
flood in Goku's hands.

18
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,166
The Spirit Bomb swelled
to massive proportions!

19
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,416
[GOKU]
Here we go!

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
[NARRATOR] It was almost
too good to be believed!

21
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,666
Goku finally had what he
needed to defeat Majin Buu.

22
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Just when time
was about to run out,

23
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,208
the mighty Saiyan was
ready to aim and fire!

24
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,541

Vegeta! Now! Move away!

think I'm doing? I can't!

28

You've got to be kidding...

29
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,208
Vegeta! What are you saying?
You've got to get out of there!

30
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,750
Why are you waiting?!
Fool! Do it!

31
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,166

This is bad! Very, very bad!

42

He won't...
He won't fire the bomb!

43
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,708
But... he must!

44
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:50,666
[CELL] How preposterous! He
would lose just to save Vegeta?

[FRIEZA giggles]

46
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,958
That Saiyan is such a sucker!

you die, you spoiled brat!

Don't disgrace our efforts
with your sentimental rubbish!

50
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,666
Launch the bomb!

177
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,500
What? Oh no...

178
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,958
[DENDE] Vegeta! Our power
levels are too depleted.

179
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,583
We don't have enough
energy to make the jump.

180
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,500
Great! What are
we supposed to do?!

181
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,208
Hey! It's in your hands!

182
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,500
We need more energy from
the Earth! Talk to your people!

183
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,750
[VEGETA]
If we can't strengthen Kakarot,

184
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,500
then our only chance is to
strengthen the Spirit Bomb!

185
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,958
Now talk!

186
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,416
No! Wait! Vegeta! Don't do it!

187
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,125
[KING KAI] We've already taken
the maximum amount of energy

188
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,416
from the Earthlings!

189
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,666
They haven't had
time to recover yet!

190
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,250
[groaning]

191
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,083
Hey, Mr. Sandwich,
I'm Fa-Fa-Farmer!

192
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,208
[KING KAI]
If we take anymore

193
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,458
we'll be drawing on
their vital life force--

194
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,416
the energy that
they need to live on.

195
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:07,291
If they give more energy
right now, they'll all die!

196
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,166
You old fool! Quiet!
Just think of the alternative.

197
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,416
You know we don't
have any other choice!

198
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:24,708
Now talk! Tell them we
need more energy! More energy!

199
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,375
But, I-I-I-I...

200
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,500
I-I c-cant!

201
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:37,166
[VEGETA] Then the whole
Universe is going to die!

202
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,000
[growls]

203
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,875
Please! Not now!
Don't let me give out now!

204
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,375
Maybe you're right! Maybe it is
the right thing to do!

205
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,875
No way! Don't you give in!

206
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,583
Please forgive me, but I can't!

207
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:17,041
I can't! It would destroy me!

208
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,291
What do you mean?

209
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,250
I've been a shameless fake
my whole life!

210
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,416
But they believe me!
They love me!

211
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,708
So if I turn my back on them
now, what will it make me?

212
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,291
[MR. SATAN]
Not even I can sink that low!

213
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,833
I-It would be worse than
death to betray them like that!

214
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,583
[sobs]

215
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,583
Hey! Listen!

216
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm the one who had
Dende wish the Earthlings

217
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,875
and their planet back to life.

218
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,500
If it wasn't for me,

219
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,166
they'd still all
be dead right now!

220
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,416
[VEGETA]
Wait a second!

221
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,375
We still have
a wish, don't we?

222
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,041
[gasping]

223
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,875
Yes! Of course!

224
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,875
Porunga is still
with us, Vegeta!

225
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,583
And he's been very patient!

226
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,500
What is your wish! You have
kept me waiting long enough!

227
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:19,500
Uhh! Yes, Porunga! Can you
bring the power level of Goku,

228
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,666
the Saiyan who is fighting Majin
Buu on the Kai Planet right now,

229
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,208
back to normal?

230
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:30,833
Such a wish is well
within my power to grant!

231
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,083
Cool! Porunga...

232
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:37,750
[speaks in Namekian]

233
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,708
Okay!

234
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,375
[laughing, cheering]

235
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,500
It's no use! I can't...

236
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,125
[KID BUU cackles]

237
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,666
[KID BUU shrieks]

238
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,916
[DENDE]
Goku! We used the third wish

239
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,291
to restore your
power back to normal!

240
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,500
[GOKU] Hey! You're right!
Whoo-hoo! It's back!

241
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,208
Thank you!
Thank you, guys... Wow.

242
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,125
[GOKU yells]

243
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:35,291
[yells]

244
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:43,833
[KID BUU growls]

245
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,666
[DENDE]
He's doing it! All right!

246
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,416
[NAMEKIANS laughing, chattering]

247
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,750
I taught him that technique!

248
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:54,708
That a boy!

249
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,833
[laughs]

250
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,500
Hey guys, you feel that?

251
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,083
[GOTEN]
Is that my Dad?

252
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,708
Yes! He has his
old strength back!

253
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,166
[FRIEZA thinking]
Hmph! Why am I not surprised?

254
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,000
[BABIDI] This must be
what joy feels like!

255
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,000
[KID BUU grunts]

256
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,166
[growling]

257
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,916
[GOKU] It looks like it's
the end of the road, Buu!

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,375
It's a darn shame!

259
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,541
[GOKU] When I first met you,

260
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,500
I could sense that
there was good in you.

261
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,125
You were like a
naughty little child

262
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,750
that didn't know any better.

263
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:41,125
FIghting was more of a game
than anything else.

264
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,000
[GOKU] But then you seperated.
The evil was expelled--

265
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:52,166
The struggle taking place inside
of you was now on the outside

266
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,541
for all to see.

267
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,375
And the darkness
overpowered the light.

268
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,958
[GOKU] After that,
you were different.

269
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,875
You were ruthless.
You became a living nightmare

270
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,416
and you delighted
in every moment of it.

271
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Didn't even show a
shred of decency or mercy!

272
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,375
And that's why
it has to end like this.

273
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,375
You'll have to
learn the hard way,

274
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:18,125
and know what it feels like
to have YOUR life

275
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,166
taken away against YOUR will!

276
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,625
It's wrong!

277
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,125
Maybe you'll come back some day.

278
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,833
As... As a better person,
I hope. I'd like that.

279
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:37,250
Perhaps we'll have
a little one-on-one!

280
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,083
[KID BUU grunts]

281
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,375
Adios!

282
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,833
I'll be waiting
for you, Majin Buu!

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,625
[KID BUU squeals]

284
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,625
--[DENDE] Goku!
--Kakarot!

287
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:19,250
Haaaa!!

[screams]

290
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,166
It's over...

291
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,375
It's about time.

292
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,750
[whimpers]

293
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:34,458
[GOKU] We make a pretty good
team after all, don't we?

294
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,458
[GOKU chuckles]

295
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:40,125
[VEGETA chuckles]

296
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,291
[BOTH laugh]

297
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,333
[NARRATOR]
Two Saiyan rivals, now friends,

298
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,000
have prevailed
against all odds.

299
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,583
Majin Buu is gone.

300
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:52,000
But true victory
could not have been won

301
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,291
without the help from
every being on Earth.
