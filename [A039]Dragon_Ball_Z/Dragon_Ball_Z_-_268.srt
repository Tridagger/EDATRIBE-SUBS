00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,583
[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:19,250
the elder Kai gave Goku an
empowered set of earrings,

3
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:22,250
allowing him to perform
an instant, effortless fusion.

4
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,333
But, there was a catch.

5
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,083
Whoever wore the
matching earring

6
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,208
would fuse with him forever.

7
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,166
[SUPER BUU laughs]

8
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,000
[NARRATOR] Back on Earth,
the super-charged Majin Buu

9
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,083
tried to destroy the
remaining survivors

10
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,375
with one, terrifying blast.

11
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:40,375
But thanks to a timely arrival
by the revitalized Goku,

12
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,333
Buu's attempts were cut short.

13
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,000
[NARRATOR]
Down but far from out,

14
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,625
Majin Buu quickly
incapacitated Tien,

15
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,208
who had returned from seclusion
to play his small part.

16
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,958
[GOKU]
He was off guard!

17
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,291
[NARRATOR]
And pulling himself together,

18
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,083
Majin Buu readied to battle
Goku head to head,

19
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,750
with powers that not even the
great Saiyan hero could stop.

20
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,541
[GOKU]
Here! Catch!

21
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,708
[NARRATOR]
Aware of the desperate odds,

22
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,416
Goku threw the Kai's
earring to Gohan,

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
deciding to save the Earth

24
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:22,333
by merging permanently
with his son.

25
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:25,416
But Gotenks' fusion wore off
inside Buu's body,

26
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
causing a sharp drop
in the monster's power.

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,541
Goku chose at the last minute

28
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,541
not to go through
with the fusion.

29
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,500
And that's when
Buu made his move.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,458
[GOKU]
Gohan!

31
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,791
[NARRATOR] Just as he had done
with Piccolo and Gotenks,

32
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,708
Majin Buu absorbed
Gohan into his body,

33
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,375
and gained his incredible power.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,666
[SUPER BUU laughs]

35
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,625
[NARRATOR]
Now, Goku must convince

36
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,958
someone else to fuse with him.

37
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,041
A task that may prove
very, very difficult.

38
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:18,125
[laughs]

39
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:29,041
[GOKU grunting]

40
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,375
[SUPER BUU] So, what're
you going to do now?!

41
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,666
Think, Goku! Both of your
sons are a part of me now.

42
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,958
Maybe we should seek
family counseling?

43
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:40,083
[laughs]

44
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,083
[GOKU]
Poor Tien...

45
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,958
[GOKU] Man, I've got to
find some more power!

46
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,583
[SUPER BUU] You know they all
resent you for leaving, Goku.

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,916
They're telling me.

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,125
That won't work on me!

49
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:02,416
You're the monster who devoured
everyone we care about!

50
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,041
[laughs]

51
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:08,500
Yes, I suppose I did, but you
were supposed to stop me.

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,291
[growls]

53
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,666
Oh, don't take it
too personally, Goku.

54
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,041
Everybody fails.

55
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:19,375
Your failure just means
the end of the world!

56
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,875
Don't worry,

57
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:24,541
if I get a chance, I'll get
rid of that creep for good!

58
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,333
Well, only one problem.

59
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,125
I don't have any bullets left.

60
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,666
Pretty lucky for Buu, huh?!

61
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,083
Yes, lucky him.

62
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,083
Tell you what I'm going to do.

63
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:41,291
I'll give you a chance to
join bodies with someone.

64
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,833
[gasps]

65
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,000
You have until the count of five
to find a suitable partner,

66
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,875
so get moving!

67
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,166
One!

68
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:59,083
[gasps]

69
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,458
Two!

70
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:22,166
[GOKU thinking] No, Dende's
size would hurt more than help.

71
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,208
Besides, we need him
for the Dragon Balls!

72
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,250
[SUPER BUU]
Three!

73
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,083
[GOKU] Oh man, Mr. Satan's
not exactly a warrior.

74
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,000
His lack of understanding
about energy could hurt, too,

75
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,583
but, he does know
basic martial arts.

76
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,500
Four!

77
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,833
I've got no choice!

78
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,833
Hey, you!

79
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,416
Huh?!

80
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,458
[GOKU]
Put this on!

81
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,666
[GOKU thinking]
What's that?!

82
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,041
[GOKU thinking]
That energy...

83
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,083
[GOKU thinking]
He's here!

84
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,666
This is as far as I go.

85
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,166
I'm sorry we're not closer,

86
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,875
but I've got my health
to think about, you know!

87
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:48,000
Heh/ That's fine, we can
wait here for now.

88
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,500
I'm sure Buu will
find me soon enough.

89
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,500
[SUPER BUU]
And five!

90
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,833
Yeah, yeah!

91
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,750
[SUPER BUU]
What is that fool doing?

92
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,666
He hasn't even
tried to fuse yet!

93
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,291
Too bad!

94
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,916
[yells]

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,083
Yeah!

96
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,875
[grunts]

97
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,875
Coward, where are you hiding?!

98
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:18,333
[BABA]
I'm outta here!

99
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:20,916
[VEGETA]
Hm?!

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,916
[GOKU]
Vegeta?!

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,833
All right! It's you! I knew it!

102
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,416
[gasps] Kakarot!

103
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,833

104
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:29,833
Hi!

105
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:33,500
What happened to your halo?

106
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:36,000
[OLD KAI]
Very interesting development.

107
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,708
Yes, I should've
seen this coming.

108
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,208
Look! It's-It's Vegeta.

109
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,125
Ah, what good luck!

110
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,625
If those two join bodies,

111
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,541
they will be a force
to be reckoned with.

112
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,791
[SUPREME KAI]
But Vegeta, sometime earlier,

113
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:56,000
he destroyed his body in
an attempt to stop Majin Buu.

114
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,416
How is it he has returned
to the living world?

115
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,791
King Yemma must have seen
the situation and intervened.

116
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,958
Yemma may look like
a brainless bear,

117
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,708
but he does have his moments.

118
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,833
[OLD KAI laughs]

119
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,250
[SUPER BUU] Does he really
think he can escape me?

120
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,625
[SUPER BUU laughs]

121
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,791
I'll hunt him down,
no matter how far he goes.

122
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:27,000
After all, I don't
have anything else to do!

[DENDE]
That's it, he's gone.

125
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,875
Hey buddy, did you see what that
guy was trying to throw to me?

126
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,166
What a time to try
to get an autograph!

127
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,083
That was the strangest thing.

128
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,750
Sorry, I can't talk right now.

129
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,458
I've gotta find a way
to improve this situation.

130
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,500
Hey!

131
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,583
Wait, don't leave me here alone!

132
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,916

remember? You owe me!

134
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,041
Uh? What happened
to you, Goku?

135
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,708
The halo on your
head has disappeared.

136
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,250
You've come back to life!

137
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,958
Uh? Oh yeah! That's
kind of a long story,

138
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,791
but basically this Old Kai
gave me his own life, and um--

139
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,000
Ah! [growls]

140
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,666
Darn! Majin Buu's coming.

141
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,958
He must be getting very
anxious to fight with me!

142
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,333
Baba, you'd better get out
of here while you still can.

143
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,583
Uh, sure, yes. Good idea.

144
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,041
I'll be rooting for you two
boys from a safe distance!

145
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,958
Okay! Ah, good-bye!

146
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,083
I don't know if you're
gonna believe this,

147
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,458
but boy am I glad to see you.

148
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,125
I've got a plan
to beat Majin Buu,

149
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,708
and with your help, I know
we can make it work, Vegeta!

151
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,625
Put this on, right now.

I know it sounds strange, but ya
have to do it. Please, hurry.

153
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,125
What for?

154
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,333
'Cause, once you put this on,

155
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:04,208
you and I will be able
to combine bodies!

That's right, think about it!

158
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,791

Sorry, the offer's tempting,
but I decline.

Go on, try your precious fusion!

That won't save you
from me, not now!

166
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,833
Come on! This is no time for us
to argue! We have to do this!

167
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,208
Get away from me, Kakarot!

168
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,541

have anything to do with you!

Listen to me, Vegeta,
we've tried this!

Cool it, Vegeta!

00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,041
You've got to understand

202
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,625
that Buu's powers
have increased a lot

203
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,833
since you last fought.

What's wrong with those

Uh, yes!

me during our battle.

that I could beat you!

the least we could do

is put our old differences
aside, just this once,

right in front of us!
