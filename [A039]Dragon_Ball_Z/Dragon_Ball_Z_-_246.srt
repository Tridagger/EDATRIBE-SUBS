[NARRATOR]
Previously on Dragon Ball Z!

00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,250
Babidi and Majin Buu set their
wicked sights on West City,

3
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,541
and forced
Goku to put his

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,750
plans for fusion
training on hold!

5
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:24,041
[BULMA]
Listen, if we let Majin Buu

6
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,875
get to the West City
and destroy it,

7
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,583
then he'll destroy
the Dragon Radar, Goku!

00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,666
[gasps]

9
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,833
[GOKU]
Yeah, that does pose a problem.

10
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,208
Trunks, listen up. I need
you to go to Capsule Corp

11
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,666
and bring back the radar.

12
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:39,958
Huh?

13
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,125
[GOKU]
While you do that,

14
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,833
I'll get in front
of Babidi and Majin Buu

15
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,708
and try to slow them down.

16
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,500
Are you sure about that?

17
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,458
Those guys are
pretty tough, you know.

18
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,083
They're going
to wanna fight back.

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:55,166
Yeah, but you let me worry
about them. I'll be okay.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,166
Now, hurry up before
they get ahead of you.

21
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,583
[NARRATOR]
With not a moment to spare,

22
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,166
Trunks raced toward Capsule
Corp at Super Saiyan speed

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,125
while Goku put the brakes
on his adversary's advance.

24
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,375
[GOKU]
Hi.

25
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,541

Goku didn't waste any time.

quickly gathered his strength

29

to give Majin Buu and
Babidi a lesson in power

30
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,125
they would not soon forget.

31
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,458
[GOKU] And this is what is
known as a Super Saiyan

32
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,166
that has ascended
beyond a Super Saiyan.

33
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,708

demonstration didn't end there.

34

And this...

35
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,375
[NARRATOR]
With a deafening roar,

36
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,083
Goku concentrated his energy

37
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,208
for the transformation
of is life!

38
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,333
Tapping into hidden depths
of his Saiyan powers

39
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,041

[NARRATOR] The end result of
this spectacular transformation?

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,291
Goku had ascended once again,

45
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,333
achieving an unprecedented
new level of power--

46
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,750
Super Saiyan 3!

Buu!

49
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,625
[NARRATOR] With his newly
energized strength and speed,

50
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,708
Goku launched a dizzying attack

51
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,375
that reduced Majin Buu to
a pudgy pink punching bag.

52
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,291
But after every blow
the Saiyan delivered,

53
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,791
Buu bounced back for more!

54
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,416
How much longer
can Goku hold off

55
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,958
this seemingly
unstoppable monster?

If they keep this up,
they'll destroy our town!

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,541
The town? They'll
destroy the whole planet!

66
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,791
Keep it up, Goku!

00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:22,666
My dad's stronger than ever!

68
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,333
This is getting dangerous.

69
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,000
Goku may be more
powerful than ever before,

70
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,208
but the harder he fights,

71
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,416
the more Majin Buu's
strength increases!

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,041

Get outta there!

in tighter spots than this.

C'mon, Buu, finish him off!

Could it be somewhere else?!

100
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,250
[DR. BRIEF] Okay, now what
was I looking for again?

101
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,291
What do you two fellows say
we take a little snack break?

102
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,958
I could have pizza bagels
ready in only five minutes!

Don't you get it?!
We can't stop looking!

104
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,708
Majin Buu will destroy West City
along with the Dragon Radar

105
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,833
and without that we won't
be able to bring back

any of the people he's killed,

107
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,625

it in high gear!

just keep looking?

I can't go on fighting

What'd ya say, Bulma?

143
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,416
I'm saying that
Trunks is looking

144
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,291
in the wrong place
for the Dragon Radar!

145
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,666
[BULMA] Sorry, it must've
slipped my mind,

146
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,041
but after we all went to look
for the Dragon Balls earlier,

147
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,750
I left it in the airplane.

Does Trunks know?!

What'd I just say?

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,166
Oh yeah, I know,
but in situations like this

152
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,208
it's really hard for me.

Oh, I just crumble
under pressure!

154

a phone and call him.

I wouldn't know where to start.

I'd do without it.

00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,083
Amazing, fighting
at this intensity,

180
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:21,250
and he's still having
the time of his life.

[phone ringing]

182
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:30,375
Hi, Bulma! How is this beautiful
day treating you, dear?

183
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,083
Uh, great, Mother. Listen, I
need to speak with Trunks now.

184
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,166
He's a little busy,
let me see if I can get him.

185
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,500
Trunks, your
mother's on the phone.

186
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,625
[TRUNKS] Tell her I don't have
time for a pep talk right now!

187
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,083
He says he doesn't have
time for a pep talk.

188
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,333
And I don't have time
for his smart mouth!

189
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,083
You tell him to
get on the phone!

190
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,958
[TRUNKS] For real?
It's in the airplane?!

191
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,458
Oh, thanks a million, Mom!

192
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,708
She said she left
it in the airplane!

193
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,583
Wait, do we even have
an airplane around here?

194
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:02,291
Help! Help...

195
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,875
So, now you want an airplane.

196
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,500
This is an airplane.

197
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:19,208
[BUU giggles]

198
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,916

No, It can't be.

[thinking] Father, you must be
fighting one incredible battle.

228
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,375
I can sense it
all the way out here.

229
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:58,916
Gohan, this may be the one fight

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,541
your father
won't be able to win.

[GOHAN gasps]

00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,708
Majin Buu is just too powerful.

233

If you want to put
an end to Majin Buu,

234
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,208
you must learn how to
fight with that sword.

235
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,583
You must use it as
an extension of yourself.

236
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,125
That is the only way.

237
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,958
I'll keep trying.

I swear this thing's
getting heavier.

243
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,125
Visualize, Gohan. See the sword
and yourself as a single entity,

244
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,541
one not complete
without the other.

Buu, you bulbous moron!

250

Are you trying to kill me along
with rest of the planet?!

And as for you,
Mr. Would-Be-Super-Hero,

254
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,875
you've done a great job of
protecting this world so far.

255
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,375
Do you have any idea how much
of it you just destroyed?!

[giggles]

257
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,875
Buu, I'm a man of courtesy
as well as strength.

258
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,333
So, I've got to tell you
that I'm quite impressed

259
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,750
by your fighting techniques.

260
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,000
I've fought beings from
beyond nameless galaxies

261
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,333
and you by far are the best.

262
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,791
Thank you!

263
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,958
[DR. BRIEF] Actually,
it's inside this capsule.

264
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,041
Is that what she
was talking about?

265
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,333
Hey, here it is! I found it!

266
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,250
Well, that's
just wonderful, Trunks.

267
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:09,333
Now, we all have
time for a relaxing lunch.

268
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:12,541
What is it with you and food?
Gotta go, love ya!

269
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,833
Gosh, I can't believe
he came all this way

270
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,875
and left without
eating anything!

271
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,166
[GOKU thinking]
There he is. Good.

272
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,083
He's on his way back
to the Lookout.

273
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,416
He must've finally
found the Dragon Radar.

274
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,250
I guess it's time to
wrap up my business here

275
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,708
so I can head back, too.

276
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,833
[BOTH]
Huh...?

277
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,291
Hey! Why you go back to normal?

278
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,916
You and me not fight
no more? Buu have fun!

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,208
Well, I had a lot of fun, too.

280
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,500
But unfortunately
I have someplace to be

281
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,416
and time won't allow me play
with you all day, Majin Buu.

282
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,875
It's time for
me to say goodbye.

[laughs]

284
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,083
Not likely!
We've been over this!

285
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,875
We'll decide when you leave!

286
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:13,166
Majin Buu, don't
listen to a word he says!

287
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,166
Get over there and crush him!

288
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,208
[BUU laughs]

289
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:21,083
All you have to do is brush
this pest out of our way

290
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,166
and then I promise you'll get
your chance to level West City.

291
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,708
That should be more than enough
to lure those three other rats

292
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,083
we're looking for
out of the woodwork.

293
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,875
Hold it, Babidi. Those
three "rats" have names.

294
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,791
Goten, Piccolo, and Trunks.

295
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,083
And I promise,
give them two days

296
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,833
and they'll be ready to fight.

297
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,916
[GOKU] There's no need for
you to destroy West City

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,500
or kill anyone else.

299
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,750
They want to fight you.

300
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:55,625
I'm asking, have some
patience. They'll come to you.

301
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,041
Are they really strong?

302
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,500
Unbelievably.

303
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:04,083
[BABIDI laughs]

304
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:05,875
Like it really matters!

305
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,333
Even if we gave them two years
it wouldn't make a difference!

306
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:13,583
They will never be strong
enough to beat the two of us!

307
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,625
Well, for starters they're
only going to fight one of you

308
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,500
because the other seems to
do nothing but bark orders.

309
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:23,500
Oh, and Majin Buu I think you
are much too gifted a fighter

310
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,875
to be controlled by
a coward like Babidi!

311
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,625
Bah! Shove it!

312
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,083
See ya.

[whimpers]

316
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:42,375
Can... you see him?

317
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:50,291
Did he... Did he just
vanish into thin air?

318
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,416
Buu, you're incompetent!

319
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,000
Don't just stand there floating,

320
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,875
get your doughy pink body moving
and find him right now!

321
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,375
Do you have wax in
your ears, bonehead?!

322
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,791
I am giving you an order!

323
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,875
I am not going to
tell you again, okay!?

324
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,458
You start moving
and you find him!

325
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,583
[BABIDI] Fine, you want
to act like a child?!

326
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
Then I'll treat
you like a child!

327
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,416
You have until the
count of three! One, two...

328
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,333
Mister Babidi?

329
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:29,750
Wha... What is it?

330
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:32,458
Buu have a better idea.

331
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:35,333
You're actually
having an idea?

332
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,166
Doesn't that sound
like a great trick?

333
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,416
Okay, then.

334
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,166
Why don't you tell me
what you've come up with

335
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,166
in that walnut-sized
brain of yours?

336
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,625
Buu have a great idea.

337
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,166
You said that already!

338
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,916
Just cough it up so we can
get on with the serious stuff.

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,166
Ooohh...

[BABIDI grunts]

344
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,333
Now you no talk.

345
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:08,833
Now no more can say words
to seal Buu back up in ball.

346
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,041
No, no, no!

00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,208
[GOTEN] You're back!
You were great, Dad!

351
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,708
[PICCOLO]
How are you feeling, Goku?

352
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,166
Fine!

353
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,250
Trunks found the Dragon Radar
and is on his way back!

354
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,333
So we've avoided
one catastrophe, I guess.

355
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:44,625
Yes, I know. Now, even if Majin
Buu does destroy West City,

356
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,500
we'll be able to
undo all of his damage.

357
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,375
And not only that...

358
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,875
We'll be able to wish back
all of the innocent people

359
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:56,416
Buu and Babidi killed today.
Every single one of them.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,791
[BABIDI grunts]

361
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,458
You teach me lots
of good things

362
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,875
but Buu think it time
Babidi go bye-bye-bye.

363
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:15,541
[BABIDI whimpers]

364
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,291
[giggles]

365
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,041
Bye-bye!

366
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:30,666
[whimpers]

367
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,125
[BUU]
Aaahhh...

368
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:42,208
[NARRATOR] Now that Babidi is
permanently out of the picture,

369
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,625
Majin Buu is free
to do his own bidding.

370
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,250
But will he continue down
the destructive path

371
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,333
that Babidi has set for him?

372
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,000
And if he does,

373
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:55,083
is there anyone left
who can stop him?
