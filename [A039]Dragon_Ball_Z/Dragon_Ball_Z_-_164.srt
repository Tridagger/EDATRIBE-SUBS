00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,125
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,625
Trunks jumped into a
one-on-one brawl against Cell.

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,583
With Vegeta beaten
and Goku still in training,

4
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:24,250
it was clear that Trunks
was the planet's last hope.

5
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,916
[KRILLIN] Hang in there,
Trunks... You have to beat Cell!

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,125
You're the only
one who can do it now!

7
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,875
[NARRATOR] Kicking
into second gear,

8
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,250
Trunks struggled to keep
Cell at bay long enough

9
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,041
for Vegeta to be rescued.

10
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,041
Now, alone on the battlefield,

11
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,250
Trunks is pushing his
powers as far as he can.

12
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,250
[TRUNKS] ...Come and get me!

13
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:47,625
I will, but show me some of that
wonderful power of yours first.

14
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,625
[NARRATOR] Cell,
loaded with confidence

15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,208
after pummeling Vegeta,

16
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,000
is actually encouraging Trunks
to unleash his maximum power.

17
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,666
The evil android is
anxious for a good fight,

18
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,041
and by the looks of it, that's
exactly what he's going to get.

19
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,958
[NARRATOR] Get ready, it's
time for these two titans

20
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,916
to engage in the
fight for the future!

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,833
Today, on Dragon Ball Z!

22
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:30,791
[TRUNKS grunts]

23
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:36,083
[TRUNKS yells]

24
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:45,583
[yelling continues]

25
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:54,791
[TRUNKS yells]

26
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:02,250
[yelling continues]

27
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,875
[ANDROID 16 thinking] I see now
why the boy was not scared.

28
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:17,375
[TRUNKS yells]

29
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:26,166
[TRUNKS yelling in distance]

30
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,625
Huh?

31
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,375
What's happening back there?

32
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,291
Hey, that's not a storm
cloud... that's Trunks!

33
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:51,583
How can I feel his energy
from this far away?

34
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,875
Yikes! I'm glad I'm
not a lightning rod.

35
00:04:55,916 --> 00:05:00,875
[TRUNKS yells]

36
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,958
[ROSHI] Earthquake!
Run for your lives!

37
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:07,041
[YAMCHA whimpers]

38
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,375
That's no earthquake.

39
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,625
[ROSHI yelps]

40
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,291
[ROSHI] Hmm...?

41
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,833
That's quite a view!

42
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,375
[CHICHI gasps]

43
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,791
Watch the hands, old man!

44
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,125
[ROSHI] D'oh!

45
00:05:21,208 --> 00:05:26,166
[TRUNKS yells]

46
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,583
[BABY TRUNKS babbles]

47
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:37,916
I've never felt energy
that strong before.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,208
It can't be possible!

49
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,333
That's Trunks' energy.

50
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:49,916
He passed Vegeta? How can that
be? He'll beat Cell for sure!

51
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:56,833
[TRUNKS yells]

52
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,208
Nice light show, Trunks.

53
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,458
It's such a shame
Vegeta isn't here to see

54
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,791
that you have
surpassed his power.

55
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:06,458
As long as I have the
power to destroy you, Cell,

56
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,250
that's all that matters to me.

57
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,208
Your kind ruined my future,

58
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,625
and I'll sacrifice
everything to change it!

59
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,125
[WOMAN A shrieking]

60
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,416
[TRUNKS] The world
I grew up in

61
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,416
was devastated by
Dr. Gero's androids.

62
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,416
They took control of the planet
and terrorized the population.

63
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,416
Here they come again! Those
monsters are going to attack us!

64
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,958
What can we do?
There's no escape!

65
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:48,375
[MEN yelling]

66
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,375
[screaming]

67
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,583
I do enjoy destroying these
cities, and how about you?

68
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,583
Isn't it wonderful
that these humans

69
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:07,833
have so many buildings
for us to annihilate?

70
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,833
Yeah, but I think we
need to spice things up.

71
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:14,416
Mass destruction just
isn't fun anymore.

72
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,208
[TRUNKS] The androids
continued their path of terror,

73
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,208
and finally found the
excitement they were looking for

74
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,750
when they slaughtered my father!

75
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,166
[VEGETA yells]

76
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,166
[VEGETA groans]

77
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,625
No!

78
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,208
[VEGETA screams]

79
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,791
[TRUNKS] Thrilled by
the new challenge,

80
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:47,208
the androids tracked
down all of the Z Fighters.

81
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:50,458
Even Piccolo was
quickly overwhelmed.

82
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,500
[PICCOLO screams]

83
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,833
[TRUNKS] And Krillin
suffered a similar fate.

84
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:13,458
[KRILLIN screams]

85
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,666
[TRUNKS] Tien was
taken out next.

86
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,208
[TRUNKS] Then the Androids
went after Yamcha!

87
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,250
Poor Yajirobe never even
saw them coming...

88
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,708
[TRUNKS] One-by-one they
destroyed the greatest fighters

89
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,041
on the planet...

90
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,375
...until there was no one
left to challenge them.

91
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,583
No one except Gohan and me.

92
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:36,375
We were the last
fighters to survive.

93
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,375
Oh, look... it's Gohan.

94
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,916
You two are gonna pay for
what you've done to this planet!

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,291
[ANDROID 18 giggles]

96
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:48,875
Do you know Tien and Piccolo
said the same thing...

97
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,958
right before we destroyed them?

98
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,375
[GOHAN grunts]

99
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,500
Trunks! Stay back!

100
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,958
[TRUNKS] Right!

101
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,833
[GOHAN grunts]

102
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,916
[TRUNKS] Gohan!

104
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,916
You little brat! How dare
you do that to my hair!

Yaaah!

[GOHAN] Masenko-Ha!

113
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:16,083
[ANDROID 18] Curse those brats!
Where have they gone?!

114
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,208
Let's just bomb the whole area.

115
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,791
That will draw those
two out of hiding.

116
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,375
What should we do?

117
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,958
Stay here. We can't
let them find us!

118
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,458
I hate androids!

119
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,875
[GOHAN thinking] If my
father were still alive,

120
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,708
he'd know what to do...

121
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,916
[GOHAN] Oh, Dad, I always
thought you were invincible.

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,541
At least to a virus...

123
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,125
But I'll be brave for you,
Dad. I'll make you proud.

124
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,333
Well, Gohan?

125
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,791
What should we do?

126
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,291
[TRUNKS] Gohan fought
a long, hard battle

127
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,625
against the androids,

128
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:06,333
but he was too
overwhelmed by their power.

129
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,291
I survived and vowed to
find a way to break the grip

130
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,000
the androids had on the planet.

131
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,250
I helped my mother build a time
machine and traveled to the past

132
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,333
to alter the events that had
led to this disastrous future.

133
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,583
You see? That's why
I'm going to defeat you!

134
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,625
Cell... I will not let you
destroy the future again!

That's the way, Trunks, keep
it up! Show me your great power.

139
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,000
You've held back
for far too long.

140
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,833
Let's see what you can do!

[TRUNKS gasps]

142
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,791
[CELL] I have grown so
bored with challengers

143
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,166
who are not worthy of
being in my presence.

144
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,333
But now that I am complete, it
will be a pleasure to do battle

145
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,875
with a Super Saiyan
at your level.

00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,750
[CELL] There in my
development chamber...

151
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,125
I learned of my destiny

00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:57,333
through the voice of

You are my ultimate achievement!

00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,541
I have spent years
constructing you from the cells

of the greatest

158
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:16,791
And soon, your first
evolution will be completed.

00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
[DR. GERO] If you are
hearing this message,

160
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:23,250
it's because I have not
survived to see your completion.

161
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,958
And though that
saddens me greatly...

162
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:29,375
I know that my revenge will
be realized through you.

163

[DR. GERO] Cell,
you will need to absorb

00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,958
the bio extract of the living

00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,791
to move into your next
stage of development.

170
00:13:54,875 --> 00:14:00,750
You must feed to grow, but your
hunger will never be satisfied.

171
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,625
That is the beauty
of your design.

172
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:08,500
You will always have an
insatiable appetite for power,

173
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,000
much like my own.

174
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,375
My enemies will become yours.

175
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:18,750
Seek them out and
destroy all of them!

176
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:23,750
But never forget that your main
objective is to become complete.

177
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:28,250
The only way to do that is
to find the other androids

178
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,750
and absorb them.

179
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:35,500
Only then will you evolve
into your perfect form.

180
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,333
[CELL] And so it began.

181
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,583
My reign over this planet
was swift and relentless.

182
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:05,291
I set out to find
Android 17 and 18

183
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
by following the
trail of devastation

184
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,791
they left in their wake.

185
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,208
Along the way I absorbed
as much bio extract as I could.

186
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,333
At first there was resistance,

187
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,250
but I consumed all
who challenged me

188
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,333
and the rest fell in line.

189
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,041
There really is nothing better
than the cold taste of fear.

190
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,541
[WOMAN B screams]

191
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,125
[MAN C] The monster...
he's coming this way!

192
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,791
Don't be afraid...
stay together!

193
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,708
[MAN D] Let's get 'im!

194
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,166
[MAN D yells]

195
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,333
[MAN D squeals]

196
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,791
[MAN D screams]

197
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,250
Let's blast him!
Come on... FIRE!

198
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:01,333
[GROUP yelling]

199
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,291
[GROUP gasping]

200
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:19,333
[screaming]

201
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,916
Retreat!

202
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,958
[screaming]

203
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:36,791
[MAN F] Oh, please, no!

204
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:37,750
[MAN F grunts]

205
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:41,958
[screaming continues]

206
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,583
[MAN C rasps]

207
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,291
[MAN G groans]

208
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:51,125
[screaming]

209
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,166
[CELL chuckles]

210
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,916
[CELL] Dr. Gero was right.

211
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,458
No one stood in my way.

212
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,333
Every victim
gave me more strength.

213
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:06,000
I could feel the cells
in my body transforming.

214
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,000
As my power grew,
so did my hunger,

215
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,291
and I yearned to
become complete.

216
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:16,000
To do that, I needed to
absorb Androids 17 and 18,

217
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,166
but no matter how
fast I searched,

218
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,333
it seemed I was always
one step behind.

219
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:26,375
Finally, I learned why. The
androids had been deactivated.

220
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,958
I believe I have you
to thank for that, Trunks.

221
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:34,250
And really, I do thank you. For
it proved to work out perfectly.

222
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,000
By stealing your time machine...

223
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,500
I was able to absorb
the androids here

224
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:40,000
and become complete.

225
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,708
And now that I'm ready,

226
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:44,875
I have a world not yet
touched by the androids.

227
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,250
Which means, all the
more for me to devour.

228
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,875
I have achieved my perfect form.

229
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,166
Dr. Gero will have his revenge

230
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,541
and this pathetic
planet will be destroyed.

231
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,416
And you're responsible
for all of it!

232
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,875
[CELL giggles]

233
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,166
[CELL chuckles]

234
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,833
By traveling back in time,

235
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,708
you thought you could
change the events

236
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,166
of the future, didn't you?

237
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,708
Well, let me assure you
that you were successful,

238
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,000
though not quite
in the way you planned!

239
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:28,458
[TRUNKS growls]

240
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,291
[CELL] Rather than prevent
the world's destruction--

241
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,166
[CELL laughs]

242
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,625
[CELL] You've guaranteed it!

243
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:47,416
[CELL growls]

244
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,416
[CELL] Let me show you my
complete power.

245
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,125
Observe, my little friend.

246
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,291
[TRUNKS] Go on!
Show me what you've got!

247
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,125
And you'll be
the first to see the

248
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,500
true power of the Saiyan race!

249
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:10,000
[TRUNKS yells]

250
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:24,250
[yelling continues]

251
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,458
[TRUNKS yells]

252
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,958
[TRUNKS shouts]

253
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,041
[TRUNKS] Give it up, Cell!
It's over!

254
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:06,041
What?! He's gone! I know he
can withstand more than that!

255
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,208
[TRUNKS grunts]

256
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,250
[TRUNKS shouts]

257
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,625
[blows landing,
BOTH grunting]

258
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:29,500
They move so fast!
Their speed is incredible!

259
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,125
[CELL chuckles]

260
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,375
You cannot win, Cell!

261
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:38,250
I'm going to make sure that
all androids are gone for good!

262
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,125
[TRUNKS yells]

263
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:58,125
[TRUNKS grunts]

264
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,791
[TRUNKS grunting]

265
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,875
[yelling]

266
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,333
[CELL grunts]

267
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,833
Huh?!

268
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,125
[CELL groans]

269
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,375
Huh?

270
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,541
[CELL chuckles]

271
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:59,208
Impressive... I must admit
you have exceeded me, Trunks.

272
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,916
At least in the area
of brute strength.

273
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:12,416
And yet, you have absolutely
no chance of defeating me!

274
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,625
[TRUNKS growls]

275
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,041
[TRUNKS] Listen to yourself!
What kind of logic is that?!

276
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,750
Oh, you'll see.

277
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,583
[CELL chuckles]

278
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:36,708
[NARRATOR] The battle between

279
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,250
Trunks and Cell is
well underway.

280
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:42,208
And after a
bone-breaking first round,

281
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:45,708
the young Saiyan seems
to have a slight upperhand.

282
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:50,000
But what secret does Cell know?
Why is he so relaxed?

283
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:54,291
Find out next time,
on Dragon Ball Z!
