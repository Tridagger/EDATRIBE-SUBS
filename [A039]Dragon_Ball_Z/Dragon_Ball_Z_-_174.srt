00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,583
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:18,125
Goku journeyed into space
and brought back a friend.

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,500
Dende!

4
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,208
Taking over Kami's position
as guardian of Earth,

5
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,833
the young Namek
didn't waste any time!

6
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,583
His first task: a new
set of Dragon Balls!

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,000
[NARRATOR] By restoring
the dragon,

8
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,708
Goku hopes to bring
back all the people killed

9
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,041
during Cell's violent rampage.

10
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:41,791
Now all he has to do is
find the Dragon Balls!

11
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:45,875
And as history has shown,
that can be a painful task.

12
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:51,291
[GOKU] Only five more.

13
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,875
[NARRATOR] But he
better make it quick,

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,333
because the evil Cell
is growing impatient.

15
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:59,083
[CELL] How boring, I should
not have given them this long.

16
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:03,500
[NARRATOR] And the
tournament is coming soon.

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,416
Now, get ready for today's
episode of Dragon Ball Z!

18
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,583
[TRUNKS yells]

19
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,875
[grunting]

20
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,000
[TRUNKS yells]

21
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:40,791
Uh, are... you
really studying, Gohan?

22
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,541
Yeah! I've spent all this
time training with my dad,

23
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,000
so I kinda figured I should
study for a while

24
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,583
like my mom wants.

25
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,791
Yeah! I guess that'd be fair.

26
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,166
[DENDE] Hey, I brought
some notes with me too.

27
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,875
Here, we'll study
them together!

28
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:00,791
[KRILLIN] Whoa, gee! They give
you guys homework on Namek too?

29
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
[DENDE] Well, yeah!

30
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,833
It takes a lot of
hard work to learn

31
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,000
how to be a good
guardian, you know.

32
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:10,083
Huh. And here I thought
that all just came naturally.

33
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,041
All this homework!

34
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:19,375
This is giving me bad
flashbacks from algebra class.

35
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:23,083
[ALL laugh]

36
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,000
[TRUNKS grunts]

37
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,875
[laughing continues]

38
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,833
[KRILLIN] Well,
you guys give me a shout

39
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,083
if you need a study break.

40
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,541
I'm gonna go to Master Roshi's.

41
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,000
[GOHAN] Okay!

42
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,958
There are only
a few days remaining.

43
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:45,208
I wonder if Goku will be able
to find all the Dragon Balls?

44
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:53,333
[ANNOUNCER] Welcome everyone
to today's extravaganza!

45
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:58,000
Now let me ask you a question:
Who here loves Mr. Satan?!

46
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,000
'Cause I sure don't hear ya!

47
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:05,041
[CROWD roars]

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,208
[cheering continues]

49
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, here he is! The
man with the iron hands!

50
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,333
World-wide
Martial Arts Champion!

51
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:25,166
[drumroll]

52
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,958
[ANNOUNCER] Hercule Satan!

53
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:35,041
[MR. SATAN growls]

54
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:40,083
[CROWD roars]

55
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,958
[growling continues]

56
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,291
[ANNOUNCER] I-I simply
don't believe it!

57
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,541
Mr. Satan is not pulling one!

58
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,791
Not two! Not three!

59
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,166
But FOUR tour busses behind him!

60
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,583
--Oh my! Isn't that incredible!
--This guy's too much...

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,958
[CROWD cheering]

62
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,833
[MR. SATAN] Who do you love?!

63
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:10,416
[MR. SATAN yells]

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,375
[CROWD cheers]

65
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,291
What's this? He's pulling
something from his cape...

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,416
What do you suppose
our hero has got?!

67
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,833
Oh my!

68
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,958
He's got three
mega-sized phone books!

69
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,583
They're from West Town,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

70
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
and you all know
how big THOSE are!

71
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,583
[MR. SATAN growls]

72
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:35,041
Surely he's not
going to rip them all?!

73
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:40,583
[MR. SATAN yells]

74
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,458
[ANNOUNCER gasps]

75
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,291
[MR. SATAN laughs]

76
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,250
[CROWD murmurs]

77
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:51,125
He did! He really did it!

78
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:59,416
[CROWD roaring]

79
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,625
Mr. Satan, can you tell
us all about your ambitions

80
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,125
for the Cell Games?

81
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,583
So, you want to know
what I'm gonna do to Cell?!

82
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:14,958
Exactly the same thing
I'm gonna do to this bus!

83
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,416
[MR. SATAN yells]

84
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,541
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

85
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,625
[ANNOUNCER] Well,
that settles it, folks!

86
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,666
Cell's about to have
a big iron fist

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,333
where his stomach should be!

88
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:28,083
Let's have a cheer
for the man of the year!

89
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,500
[CROWD roars wildly]

90
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,041
[ANNOUNCER]
Seriously, Mr. Satan,

91
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:35,000
is there anything you can't do?

92
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,166
Hold on!

93
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,083
[MR. SATAN growls]

94
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,625
[laughing]

95
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,083
[ANNOUNCER] Now why
don't 'cha come over here

96
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,875
and sign some autographs?

97
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,666
[CROWD cheering]

98
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,000
That's just sad...

99
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,833
[ROSHI sips]

100
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,375
It sure is. Somebody
could have used that bus.

101
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,875
[GOKU] Alright! This makes four!

102
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,083
So... how'd it go?
Did you advance?

103
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,625
[VEGETA chuckles]

104
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,291
[PICCOLO] Not bad, Vegeta.

105
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,541
[PICCOLO] But it's not enough.

106
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,208
Oh, wow! How do you like that?

107
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,458
Two Dragon Balls
are moving at once!

108
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,958
Somebody must've beat me to 'em!

109
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:59,625
[chickens clucking]

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,375
[TAO grunts]

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,750
[INTERCOM] Who is it?

112
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,208
[TAO] It's me.

113
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:26,125
[INTERCOM] Oh, General Tao!
I've been waiting for you!

114
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:40,666
So Tao, I sure hope you brought
the goods that you promised me.

115
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,333
[TAO chuckles]

116
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,666
[TAO] But of course!

117
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,958
[VODKA gasps]

118
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,125
[TAO chuckles]

119
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,375
So these are the
famous Dragon Balls

120
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,625
that make any wish
come true, is that right?

121
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,041
A valuable buy at any price,

122
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,000
and a bargain at just
two hundred thousand each.

123
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,416
And even if that monster
destroys everyone on Earth

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,750
I can still survive with these?

125
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,583
I can sit as snug as a bug
in my fortress here

126
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,125
and wait for
Cell to go away, ah?

127
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,333
I accept gold only.

128
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:15,125
And then, after Cell
has done his dirty work,

129
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,708
I will step out from
the rubble and build an empire!

130
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,250
Think of it!
No rival gangsters!

131
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,250
No meddling police!

132
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,541
They will call me "Emperor!"

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,250
Now how long
will it take you

134
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,125
to find the rest of
the Dragon Balls?

135
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,166
[TAO] Don't you
worry about that,

136
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,708
notice how quickly
I found these two!

137
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,041
Yeah, that's right!
I trust you there, General!

138
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,833
[TAO chuckles]

139
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,583
[TAO] I probably won't
find the others

140
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,208
on the black market like these,

141
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,041
but he doesn't have to
know about that.

142
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,750
That's what I call a big door!

143
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:06,125
[sirens blaring]

144
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,583
Huh?!

145
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,291
Hey, I'm not expecting anyone.

146
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,625
Huh? That's funny!

147
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,875
What? A Dragon Ball?!

148
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,375
What the--?!

149
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,208
I'll bet they're
in here for sure!

150
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:29,291
Seems the chicken has
brought his own frying pan.

151
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:33,250
Huh? Chicken?

152
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,958
Where's a--?

153
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,708
[TAO] We should take
care of him at once!

154
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,833
[VODKA] Huh? Uh...

155
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,041
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure!
Let's get him!

156
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,500
[VODKA chuckles]

157
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,125
Chicken...?

158
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,541
Huh?

159
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:54,791
Hello? Is anybody home?

160
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,375
Well, I'm coming in now!

161
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,333
[VODKA chuckles]

162
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:07,375
[VODKA] Alright, Mister!
It's time to cook your chicken.

163
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,708
Huh?

164
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,875
[VODKA laughs]

165
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,000
[ALL cheer]

166
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,958
[VODKA] That's what
I'm talkin' about!

167
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,250
Wow! These things are sharp!

168
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,708
Someone could really get hurt!

169
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,750
[VODKA] Uhhh...

170
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,833
[VODKA] Uh, what just happened?

171
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,500
Could someone please explain?

172
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,000
Looks like your weapons haven't
been inspected very recently.

173
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,666
Well, have they been?!

174
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,208
[HENCHMEN] No, boss! We, uhh...

175
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,625
You idiots!

176
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,541
How many times have I told you
to inspect the weapons

177
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,708
so that they'll work
when we need them to?!

178
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,958
[HENCHMEN] You never said that!

179
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,958
Well then, we'll just
have to wait

180
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,000
'til he comes in here
with his Dragon Balls

181
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,250
and then we'll
threaten him in person!

182
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,791
Hey, I'm really close.

183
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,875
Well, stranger, why don't
you come in here and visit?

184

[VODKA chuckles]

185
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,291
[GOKU] Hello?

186
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,458
[VODKA] That's right, over here!

187
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,375
[VODKA] Don't just stand
there! Please, come in!

189
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,666
Yeah, now I've got 'em!

190
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,166
Wouldn't 'cha know!

191
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,708
I was about to
say the same thing.

192
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,208
Now just give up
the Dragon Balls

193
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,166
nice and slow
and then go away

194
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,375
or this is going
to get very ugly!

[VODKA whimpers]

196
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,166
Huh?

197
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,666
Hey, General Tao, is that you?

198
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,291
Pardon?

199
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:01,250
Remember me? My name's Goku!

200

[TAO] Go... ku?

201
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,791
We've had our differences,
but it's good to see you again!

202
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,958
Why me...? Why...?

[VODKA chuckles]

204
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:47,000
But first you'll tell me where
you've hidden your chicken!

205
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,583
That's right,
I know you have one!

206
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:50,500
Chicken?

207
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,125
Where?

208
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't play dumb!
The one with the fryin' pan!

209
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,500
Is this chicken
like a pet of yours?

210
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,458
[HENCHMAN A] Stop confusing him!
Just give us your Dragon Balls!

00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,833
I should really learn
not to use that much power.

Hmm?

do now, strong guy?

here! I double dare you!

Well, I'm feeling...
a bit... sick today!

I feel bad!

245
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,416
You guys spent all that time
finding those Dragon Balls

246
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,875
and I don't have anything to
give you in exchange for them.

247
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,208
I wish I could
make this a fair trade...

[TAO] Oh really?

249
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:06,375
How about this, Goku?
Let's play a little game.

If you can untangle all three
of these puzzle rings

252
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,250
by tomorrow at dawn,

253
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,000
then both of our
Dragon Balls will be yours!

254
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,583
But if you cannot,

255
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,791
then you will surrender
the ones you've collected!

256
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,958
Fair and square,
wouldn't you say?

257
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:30,250
Yeah, I guess.

258
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,416
Oh! Puzzle rings!

Tao, now that is a great idea!

260
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, yes! So, Goku, do we
have ourselves a deal or not?

261
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,250
You bet!

262
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,000
I've never tried it, but
I'm sure it can't be too bad!

263
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,000
Surely not!

264
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:56,166
Now let's say we get our
good friend here a comfy chair.

265
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,958
Yeah, sure!

266
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,916
Now, may I get
your jacket for you?

267

We want you to be comfortable.

you, so, we'll withdraw.

Sure, that's fine.

you in case you need anything.

And I'll just turn this off.
So distracting.

in the morning, Goku!

never gonna find us here!

frozen like a statue!

in this ultimate match?

Will it be the perfected Cell?
Will it be our hero Goku?

Or is the Earth's salvation
to be found in the hands
