00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,541
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,708
Goku and Gohan headed home
after completing their training

3
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,958
in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

4
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:22,500
Elsewhere, Cell was
doing his own training

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,541
to prepare for the approaching
Martial Arts Tournament.

6
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,000
As Vegeta quarreled
with the others over who

7
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,333
would get to train in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber,

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,041
Goku decided to take
a different approach!

9
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,833
[GOKU] Let's get your
Mom and go on home.

10
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,333
We'll have time to relax there.

11
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,833
I figure we'll have
three days of rest,

12
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:45,375
plus three days of training,

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,541
and then three more days of
rest before the tournament.

14
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,166
[GOHAN] Hey, Dad. Can
I ask you something?!

15
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,875
--[GOKU] Hm?
--Well, I just wanna know...

16
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,125
Do you think we have
a chance to beat Cell?

17
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,875
[GOKU] Hey, let's not worry
about all that right now!

18
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,541
We've got nine days!
Let's kick back for a while!

19
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:05,125
[NARRATOR] And so Goku's
unusual training program began!

20
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:07,541
[GOHAN] Gosh! How nice!

21
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,125
[NARRATOR] The Super Saiyans'
stomachs have been filled,

22
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,000
and now it's time for
Gohan to do his chores!

23
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,125
Today on Dragon Ball Z!

24
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,833
[GIRL] Ahh! I see you!

25
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,500
[GIRL] C'mon!
Just a little closer!

26
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,208
[GIRL] You little rascal!

27
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,625
[GIRL screams]

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,416
[coughing, gasping]

29
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,375
Are you okay?

30
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:17,750
[GIRL screams]

31
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,708
How dare you?! You fiend!

32
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,583
What? For saving you?

33
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,833
[GIRL growls]

34
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:23,458
You!

35
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,250
Neeh!

36
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,375
[GIRL] Go back where
you came from!

37
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,833
Uh?

38
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,583
[GOHAN] Huh?

39
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,500
Oh, wow! Cool!

40
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,666
I don't remember
that being there!

41
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,916
[GOHAN] Oh, man! Shoot!

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,041
Don't tell me this
village is deserted too!

43
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,291
Gosh!

44
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,416
At this rate, I'll never
get Mom's shopping done!

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
This is the fourth
village I've been to!

46
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:03,166
Cell has really put
a scare into people.

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,291
I wonder where
they've all gone?

48
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,125
[GOHAN] Oh!

49
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,208
Great! Someone's still here.

50
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,666
Now what do you need
money for, you fool?!

51
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,291
The world's ending!

52
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,000
Perhaps. But no one
knows that for sure.

53
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,541
Especially not you.

54
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:23,750
Ahh! Shut your face, old man!
We're just gonna take it!

55
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,875
Look! We'll trade ya for it!

56
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,625
You can have free lodging
in the shelter with us!

57
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,708
You dig?

58
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:32,875
--That shelter is a bad idea!
--Huh?!

59
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,250
I've said that from the start!

60
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,708
--[GOHAN] Excuse me?
--Huh?

61
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,500
[MAN 2] What do you think
you're doing, small fry?!

62
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,166
Well, just picking a few
things up for my mom.

63
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,458
Hey, leave him be, Birdwell!
He's just a young punk!

64
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,250
Buzz off, kid!
We're sold out!

65
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,791
[GOHAN] Huh?!
But what's all this!

66
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:51,125
The Bourbon family
bought it! For the shelter!

67
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,125
Stop your nonsense! Now!

68
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,666
Hey, young man! Just tell me
what you need, okay?

69
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,125
Sure!

70
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
Let's see... One bag of--

71
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,625
Listen! What's your
problem, old man?!

72
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,666
Are you deaf?!
We need this! To survive!

73
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,291
Not just us! Everyone!

74
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,916
All of the villagers
are counting on you!

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,791
Give us the food!

76
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,291
Why should I?!

77
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,750
So the Bourbon family can
make the villagers work for it?!

78
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,666
Kasdan! Hey! I don't
think he's getting it!

79
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,833
I think he needs a
little persuasion!

80
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,958
--[GOHAN growls]
--Hey! Stop that!

81
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,833
What are you doing?!

82
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,916
[BIRDWELL chuckles]

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,375
[BIRDWELL]
This oughta do the trick!

84
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:29,500
[BIRDWELL chuckles

85
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,916
[GIRL screams]

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,208
--[GIRL] Cell! It's Cell!
--What?! He came back?!

87
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,125
--He's back!
--What?! Cell's been here?!

88
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:37,041
[KASDAN] Darn right!
I knew he'd come back!

89
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,708
Let's get to
the shelter, Birdwell!

90
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:42,500
See?! You should have taken us
up on our offer, you old coot!

91
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,250
[BIRDWELL screams]

92
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,875
[thinking] What the heck
is Cell doing out here?!

93
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:51,083
[GIRL] Oh, my gosh! Run!
Run! It's Cell! Cell's here!

94
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:51,875
--Heh?!
--Huh?

95
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,291
[GIRL] Run everybody! Run!

96
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,708
Hey! I know you!

97
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,125
[GIRL gasps]

98
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,458
Well, Miss Lime! Where's Cell?!

99
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,333
[LIME screams]

100
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,916
[LIME giggles]

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,250
Now, Lime! How many times have
I told you never to lie again?!

102
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,958
Huh?

103
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,791
Cell's not here?

104
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:14,666
[GOHAN] So that's the shelter
they were talking about!

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,000
[grunting]

106
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,500
Yes. The villagers have
gone there for protection.

107
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,208
Just in case Cell comes back.

108
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:24,416
So... Cell was actually here
before in the village?

109
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,750
[grunting]

110
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,125
That's right.

111
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,500
There weren't a whole lot of
fireworks so to speak,

112
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:34,458
not in those days. He was still
stalking his victims for energy.

113
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,416
Oh... I see.

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,375
Oh yes. Mind you, he was
comparatively weak back then.

115
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,833
Still gathering lifeforce
to build up his strength.

116
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,291
[MAN screams]

117
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,666
[CELL] Hmmm...
What a waste of time.

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,166
Just a bunch of
weaklings! Pitiful!

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,083
[LIME sobs]

120
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:59,208
[growling]

121
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,750
[GOHAN sighs]

122
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,541
Yes, Lime lost her
parents that day.

123
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,541
My gosh!

124
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,791
[LIME sniffles]

125
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:11,375
If you've seen... seen the
Cell then you know that

126
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,041
there is no use in running
away or building a shelter!

127
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:18,125
I'm not sure why they're
deluding themselves.

128
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,750
Believing in the shelter
brings them comfort, I guess.

129
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,250
They're a bunch of
fools! That's all!

130
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:28,041
Anyway, we still
have eight days to live.

131
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,583
That's not bad!

132
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,166
So here we are!

133
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,458
Trying to make the most out
of these last peaceful days.

134
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,916
[groaning]

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,750
[LIME] Hm? Uh-oh, Gramps!
It's your back again!

136
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,125
Why can't I do it?!
I'm big enough!

137
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,875
You're still a little
young, child! Thanks!

138
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,458
Uh... Hey, I can help!

139
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,916
Ooohh...

140
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,583
[GOHAN] Uh... Hmm...

141
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,916
Hm?

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,041
Yes, I'd love your help!

143
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,250
[GOHAN] Okay, let's see here!

144
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,708
[GOHAN grunts]

145
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:06,125
[LIME] Hey, silly!

146
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:06,666
[GOHAN] Huh?!

147
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,250
[GOHAN grunting]

148
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,041
Aren't you
forgetting something?

149
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,000
Even I know that you can't
chop wood without an axe!

150
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,250
Here!

151
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:17,541
[GOHAN] Huh?!

152
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,125
Uhh... Yeah!

153
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,583
Gosh! Oops!

154
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,750
[GOHAN grunts]

155
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:28,125

157
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,500
Hmm...

[GOKU yawns]

159
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,291
H-Hey...

160
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,541
Is it possible we're
taking things too lightly?

161
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,083
Hm? What do you mean?

162
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,083
I mean the tournament!

163
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,791
We only have eight
days left, you know?

164
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,666
All this yawning is
making me lose my focus!

165
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,791
I'm getting too relaxed here!

166
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,291
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

You bum! You never worry,
do you? My gosh...

170
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:11,583
Hey! Come on, now! Move!

171
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,375
We only have eight
days left, you know?!

172
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,791
You wanna be
ready, or what?!

173
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:21,000
[BOURBON] That does it!
You idiots!

174
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,500
You need money?!
What in the world for?!

175

He's just an old man!

it? Now listen, dopes!

00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:44,041
Wow! You know that?
But how were you able to tell?

351
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,500
Hmmm...

352
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,833
[LAO yells]

353
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,791
[BOTH gasp]

354
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:57,000
[BOURBON] KO'd! Now
finish him off, General Tao!

355
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,750
That'll teach them to cross me!

356
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,750
Sure, that's what
I'm paid for!

357
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,208
I'm your friendly
neighborhood killer!

358
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,375
[LIME cries]

359
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,416
[GENERAL TAO] No hard feelings,
old man. It's just a job.

360
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,583
Dodonpa Wave, fire!

361
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,416
[LIME] Ahhh! No!

362
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,250
[BOTH chuckle]

363
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,375
--Say what?!
--What happened?!

364
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,875
I happened! That's what!

365
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,166
[LIME] Oh, my goodness!

366
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,458
Cocky little kid. No matter.
This will shut him up!

367
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:46,083
[thinking] Wait a second!
That face... It can't be!

368
00:19:46,166 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey, kid! What's your name?!

369
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,375
[GOHAN] It's Gohan!

370
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,250
[GENERAL TAO] Well!
Thank goodness!

371
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,750
I thought you were
someone named Goku!

372
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,041
Close enough! I'm his son!

373
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:56,875
What?!

374
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,375
[thinking] Not that kid!

375
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,791
[GOKU yells]

376
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:04,083
[blows landing,
GOKU yelling]

377
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,666
Here, kid!

378
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,875
[GENERAL TAO grunts]

379
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:07,958
Take that!

380
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,708
[GENERAL TAO chuckles]

381
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,875
[GOKU yells]

382
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,916
Hmm?!

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,916
[GENERAL TAO screams]

384
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,416
[GENERAL TAO whimpers]

385
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,666
Hey, what the heck's
wrong with you?!

386
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,458
You look like you've
just seen a ghost!

387
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,083
Oh, no! Not me!

388
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:29,458
You will soon though!
If you fight that kid!

389
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:33,416
As for me, I quit!

390
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,041
[GENERAL TAO yells]

391
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:38,250
[BOURBON] You can't quit!

392
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,416
[GENERAL TAO] I just did!

393
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,416
[BOURBON whimpers]

394
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
[CROWD]

395
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:43,458
[WOMAN] He was going to
lock us all out!

396
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,458
[MAN 1] He's a thief!

397
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,458
[BOURBON] No, no! I can explain!

398
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,958
[MAN 2] Let's beat
the tar out of him!

399
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,291
[BOURBON] You're super strong,
right! Please! Please!

400
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,125
Help me! They're mad!
Blood thirsty!

401
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,916
That's because
you cheated them!

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,833
[BOURBON] I know! I know!
But I can make up for it!

403
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,750
Please! I'll do anything!
Anything! Please!

404
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,166
[BOURBON whimpers]

405
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,291
[LIME gasps]

406
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,750
Yaaah!

407
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,875
[CROWD gasps, screams]

408
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,750
What have you done?!

409
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,166
Don't you see? If I can
do that to the shelter,

410
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,583
just think what
Cell could've done!

411
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,583
That thing can't protect
you against a guy like Cell!

412
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,500
[BOTH] Mm-hmm!

413
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,833
[GOHAN] Hi, everybody,
I'm Gohan!

414
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:31,166
I know that Cell's scary, but,
instead of expecting the worst,

415
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,041
I think we should
hope for the best!

416
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,708
Cell isn't invincible!

417
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,750
Haven't you ever heard
that the bigger they are,

418
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,083
the hard they fall?

419
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,708
[GOKU] Gohan! Hey! Up here!

420
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:45,041
[GOHAN] Dad! What
are you doing here?

421
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,708
Well, looking for you.

422
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,166
Aren't you supposed to be
getting stuff for your Mom?

423
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,708
Oops! I forgot!

424
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,958
Hey! No you didn't!

425
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,250
Thanks!

426
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,875
[LIME giggles]

427
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,500
[LAO] It's been a great pleasure
getting to know your son.

428
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,166
Gee, thanks.

429
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,875
His power is enormous.
Just like his Dad's.

430
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,875
[GOKU laughs]

431
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,333
Don't tell! Okay?

432
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,875
[LAO] Hm?

433
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,916
[GOHAN] Mister Lao?
Thanks a lot for everything.

434
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,708
Please come and visit us.

435
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,333
Sure!

436
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,000
Hey! Let's boogie.

437
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,541
Right!

438
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,583
Beat Cell. I know you can do it!

439
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,791
[BOTH] Huh?

440
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,958
I know you'll
both be there.

441
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,958
At the big tournament, right?

442
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,208
[LAO chuckles]

443
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:37,458
[LIME] Goodbye, Gohan!
Come back and see us soon!

444
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:40,541
[NARRATOR] With only 8 days left
until the tournament begins,

445
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,500
Cell is consumed
with the desire

446
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:44,625
to test his abilities in combat!

447
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:48,625
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile,
our pure-hearted heroes

448
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,583
are more worried
about what's for dinner,

449
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:52,750
and how best to enjoy
the precious time

450
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,208
that they have together.
