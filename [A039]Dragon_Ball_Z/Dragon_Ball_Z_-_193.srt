00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] On the last
episode of Dragon Ball Z...

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,625
Dende used the newly
remodeled Dragon Balls

3
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:21,041
to summon a new and
improved Eternal Dragon!

4
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,458
The scaley, green
titan now had the power

5
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,916
to grant two
wishes instead of one!

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,958
It was a bargain
for ball gatherers

7
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,583
that couldn't be refused!

8
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,125
And while Earth's Special
Forces were seeking

9
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:35,458
to restore life above,

10
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,333
a shameless opportunist
was taking all the credit

11
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,041
for their victory, down below!

12
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,458
What a bunch of suckers!
And what a turkey!

13
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,458
[MR. SATAN]
Who loves me?!

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,000
[NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the wish
to restore Cell's victims

15
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,625
back to life was granted

16
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,375
and the others realized
that a special trip

17
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,250
to see Porunga could
bring Goku back as well!

18
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,000
But he had other plans!

19
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,833
[GOKU]
Hey, don't I get a say in this?

20
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:01,208
As a Saiyan baby, I was
sent to Earth to destroy it.

21
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,875
And unfortunately,
it's kinda like

22
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,000
I've been fulfilling
that mission all along.

23
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,291
So I'm gonna stay here now.
I don't really mind.

24
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,166
King Kai says I can
get special treatment

25
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,541
'cause I saved
the Earth and all.

26
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,916
I'll be able to keep my body,
and from what I hear

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,625
there's lots of
interesting people to meet!

28
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,791
It'll be fun!

29
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,708
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

30
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,250
I appreciate your
feelings towards me,

31
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,791
but you'll have to find
something else to wish for.

32
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,458
This is my home now.

33
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,708
Dad!

34
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,875
[GOKU] You all better
take notes of everything

35
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,416
that happens in your life,

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,958
'cause when they're through,
I'll want to hear all about 'em!

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,541
Until then, bye!

38
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,666
Huh?

39
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,541
[NARRATOR]
And so their beloved Goku,

40
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,541
who had been both
savior and friend,

41
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,375
decided to continue his life

42
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,458
beyond the mysterious
frontier known as death!

43
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,750
But those who know Goku,
know that he will be watching!

44
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,541
Always and forever!

45
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,541
[DRAGON]
You have one wish remaining!

46
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,791
One wish!

47
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,625
Make it!

48
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,333
It is time!

49
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,416
[GOHAN]
Gosh! What d'ya say, guys?

50
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,208
Can anyone think of a good wish?

51
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,000
[MR. POPO] I can never
think of a good wish

52
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,625
when the Dragon is here!

53
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,791
[TIEN]
Me either!

54
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,625
[PICCOLO]
I'm kind of at a loss myself!

55
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,166
The wish!

56
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,583
[YAMCHA laughs]

57
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,500
If we can't think of a
good wish, what about a bad one?

58
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,375
I mean wouldn't it be cool
if we were all filthy rich?

59
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,500
Well, guys?

60
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,500
[PICCOLO growls]

61
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,500
[DRAGON]
I'll wait no longer!

62
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,791
Do you have a wish, or not?

63
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,916
Yes! I do!

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,625
I'd like you to change Androids
17 and 18 into human beings,

65
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,958
so that they can live
their lives in peace!

66
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,583
[GOHAN]
Gosh, Krillin!

67
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:14,958
That wish can not
be granted now!

68
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:19,875
[DRAGON]
It is beyond my power to do so!

69
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,708
[ANDROID 18]
What's he doing?!

70
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,583
[KRILLIN]
Sorry, guys! I had to try!

71
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,625
Hey, look! No prob!
The girl's cool!

72
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,208
But her boyfriend!
I'd never wish that guy back!

73
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,416
Would you guys?

74
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Sure! Haven't we already tried?

75
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,625
We wished all of
Cell's victims back, right?

76
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,083
And he was one of them!

77
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,625
Besides what would Goku do
if he were in our shoes?

78
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,208
[YAMCHA]
Right! I see what you mean!

79
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,625
Hey, you've got the floor, bro!

80
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,791
Great! I have one more wish!

81
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,791
Could you take the explosives
out of the Androids' bodies?

82
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,833
That shouldn't
be too hard, right?

83
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,625
Man! Krillin!

84
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,916
[YAMCHA] I hope you know
what you're doing!

85
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,166
I can!

86
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,333
Alright!

87
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,125
[GOHAN]
Krillin...

88
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:14,875
There! It has been done!

89
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,375
Thanks! Thanks very much!

90
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:25,541
You're welcome! I must go now!

91
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,041
[KRILLIN]
Wow! Beautiful!

92
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,583
Man! Listen to that!

93
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,000
What's the deal?

94
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:57,416
Why are you so bent
on helping those two?

95
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,750
Well, I guess,
I guess, it's that...

96
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,708
I guess, it's that
I like that girl, guys!

97
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,625
Gosh! You dog!
You really like her!

98
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,125
[KRILLIN] Doctor Gero's the one
that made her into an Android!

99
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,083
She hasn't done anything wrong!

100
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,166
Yamcha, sorry about earlier!

101
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,041
[YAMCHA]
Huh?

102
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,625
I didn't mean to hog the wish!

103
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,916
It wasn't fair! You had one too!

104
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,541
Oh my gosh!

105
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,625
You didn't know I was
just kidding about that?!

106
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,833
Hey! Come on, guys!
You didn't really think

107
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,958
I was gonna ask the
Dragon for money, did you?

108
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,916
Man! Gimme a break!

109
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,333
[YAMCHA]
What a buncha kooks!

110
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,583
Me, ask the Dragon for money!

111
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,500
That's a good one!

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,208
Gosh! They're nice!

113
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,833
[TIEN]
Hey! You like the girl, right?

114
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,541
So what's up? Why did you
wanna wish that guy back, too?

115
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:52,875
Well, I know it's strange!

116
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:55,458
But I want her
to be truly happy!

117
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,291
And those two make
such a good couple

118
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,416
that I thought she'd
be happier with him!

119
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,208
Well, that's why!

120
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,708
[YAMCHA]
Dude! You're hopeless!

121
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,208
[ALL laugh]

122
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,750
If that's what you humans
call love, count me out!

123
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,791
[ANDROID 18]
Hello?!

124
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,000
[GROUP]
Huh?

125
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,958
Oh, wow! There she is!
How'd she get here?

126
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,958
Hey! Bonehead! 17 is
my twin brother!

127
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,583
Oh, man!

128
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,791
No! This is excellent, you dope!

129
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:26,041
Didn't you hear her?
That guy's her twin brother!

130
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,250
I wouldn't celebrate
if I were you!

131
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,791
If you think you
won my heart

132
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,791
because of that lousy
wish, you're mistaken!

133
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,916
I didn't ask for your help!

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,458
[ANDROID 18]
But it was really nice of you.

135
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,000
It was? Y-You mean,
you're not mad at me?

136
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,208
[ANDROID 18]
Not really, no.

137
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,666
[KRILLIN] Well, then, would you
like to come over and join us?

138
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,708
No thanks!

139
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,875
[KRILLIN]
Aw, man!

140
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,000
Whoa! Krillin!
You are so in there!

141
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,625
That chick digs you,
man, I can tell!

142
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,708
Are you sure?

143
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes, I'm sure!
But she's a woman, dude!

144
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,833
Oh man!

145
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,000
Like I say, she's a girl
and there's no tellin',

146
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,958
but I think you have a chance!

147
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:23,083
[YAMCHA] Stick close to my
advice and you'll do just fine!

148
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,833
After all, Krillin!
It's my specialty!

149
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,791
Trust me! Goku may have taught
you how to be a great fighter,

150
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,416
but when it comes
to love, I'm the master!

[YAMCHA &amp; GOHAN laugh]

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,166
There's no comparison!

[YAMCHA]
I heard that!

154
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,750
At least you're man enough
to admit it, Piccolo!

155
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,250
Fighting's relatively easy!

157
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:48,708
Man! I really
wish Goku was here!

Nobody could let go
and laugh like he could!

[YAMCHA]
Yeah! No kidding!

160
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,541
Celebrating just isn't
the same without Goku!

00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,500
Let's not be sad!

162
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,208
That's not what
Goku was all about!

163
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,333
I guess you're right, Tien!

164
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:08,583
Of course! Well, look guys,
I need to be heading that way!

Hey, take care of yourself, bro!

00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,375
Goodbye, Tien!
Tell Chiaotzu I said hi!

168
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,166
Yeah, sure! And guess what?

169
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,791
You're the man
of the house now, Gohan!

170
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,291
So take good care
of your mom, alright?

171
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,416
Hey, Trunks!

172
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,625
Go show those two Androids what
you're really made of, alright?

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Thanks! You don't know how good
it makes me feel to hear that!

175
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,833
See ya!

176
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,958
Bye, Tien!

177
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,625
[YAMCHA] Well, guys,
I guess it's about that time!

178
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,541
[KRILLIN] Yeah, Yamcha, I guess
we oughta be going now!

179
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,333
What's your plan, Trunks?
Are you goin' back right away?

180
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,583
Nah! I'm gonna get a good rest!

181
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,458
I'll head out in the morning!

182
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,041
Great! We'll see you off, okay?

183
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,166
Cool!

184
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,083
What now, Piccolo? Are you
planning on living up here?

185
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,083
Yeah! I think so!

186
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,875
Then I'll come visit,
if it's alright with you!

187
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,000
You know it is!

188
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,791
I wouldn't miss
it for the world, kid!

189
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,166
[DENDE] Yeah, don't be
a stranger, Gohan!

190
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,666
I'm counting on you to visit!

191
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,000
[GOHAN]
Gosh, Dende!

192
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,583
It can be lonely at the top!

193
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,416
[GOHAN]
Aw! You're gonna love it here!

194
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,416
Mister Popo's the greatest!
Well, I guess this is it, guys!

195
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,166
Here we go!

196
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,125
This is the beginning
of the rest of our lives!

197
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,708
Bye, guys!

198
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,875
[POPO]
Goodbye, everyone!

199
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,750
[GOHAN]
There's Korin's place!

200
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,333
Hey!

201
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,791
Trunks, get some good
rest before your trip!

202
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,250
Well, we'll see
you guys tomorrow morning!

203
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,583
It's been great!

204
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,916
Bye!

205
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,583
[TRUNKS] My Father
did that? Are you sure?

206
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,750
Yeah! He went ballistic!

207
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,750
When he saw you get killed,
he went bonkers!

208
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,166
He attacked Cell like I've
never seen him attack before!

209
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,916
[TRUNKS]
You've gotta be kidding!

210
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,916
I'll be darned!

211
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,833
[YAMCHA]
See ya later, Trunks!

212
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:41,958
[TRUNKS]
Adios!

213
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,333
[GOHAN]
And that's the whole story, Mom!

214
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,708
[CHICHI sobbing]

215
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,625
I'm sorry, Mom!

216
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,416
So, he didn't wanna come back?

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,208
What an amazing man he is!

218
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:03,541
Isn't that just like him?

219
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,166
Please, Mom! Don't be sad!

220
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,791
This is the way
he really wanted it!

221
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,166
He told me so himself!

222
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,625
Besides, I can feel him,
Mom! He's there!

223
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,125
ChiChi, Gohan's right, honey.

224
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:21,416
Yeah! Since Goku
chose to stay there!

225
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm fine about it!

226
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:27,541
Goku's always known what's
best for everybody! Always!

227
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,625
[BULMA]
I'm really proud of you, Son!

228
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,416
[TRUNKS]
Thanks, Mom!

229
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,333
Be careful!

230
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,875
Right!

231
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,166
[TRUNKS]
Dad.

232
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,166
So long!

233
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,000
Love ya Trunks, goodbye!

234
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,000
[GOHAN] Bye, Trunks!
You're the greatest!

235
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,375
[TRUNKS]
Goodbye, Gohan!

236
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:13,375
Later, Dude!

237
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,583
Bye, Trunks!

238
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:16,083
[TRUNKS]
See ya, guys!

239
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,291
Huh?

240
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,125
Father!

241
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,083
[KRILLIN]
Hm?

242
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,166
[CHICHI] Gohan!
It's time to take a break!

243
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,791
Gohan? Hey!

244
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,708
Open up! I have
a snack for you!

245
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:45,791
Oh, no! What am I going
to do with that young man?

246
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,708
I'll bet my Father is in on
this little escapade as well!

247
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,875
[CHICHI] Honestly!
Escaping through the window!

248
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,583
How juvenile can they get?

249
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,041
It won't last!
They'll come crawling back

250
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,708
right around dinner time! Mm-hm!

251
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,166
[GOHAN]
Gosh, it's such a great day!

252
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,541
And I don't feel as guilty
sneaking out with you, Grandpa!

253
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,625
Yeah, it's nice to sneak
out with your Grandpa

254
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,916
because you don't
get in trouble!

255
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,166
At least you won't! I'm dead!

256
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,958
Poor, Grandpa!

257
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,791
[OX-KING] Ahh, well!
Somebody's gotta take the fall!

258
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,208
[GOHAN]
Thanks!

259
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:28,208
[OX-KING] Ahh! Fresh air,
sunshine-- this is the life!

260
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,250
[GOHAN]
Yeah!

261
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,375
[GOHAN] Have you ever
lived in the city, Grandpa?

262
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:38,000
[OX-KING] Me? Oh, no! I don't
think I could stand it!

263
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,166
It's too crowded in the city!

264
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,125
A guy my size
needs plenty of space!

265
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,125
Yeah!

266
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,166
Come on!

267
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,416
Where are you going?

268
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,625
I'll show ya, Grandpa.
It's right over here!

269
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,791
[OX-KING]
Gohan, it's almost dinner time!

270
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,250
Where are you going?

271
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,250
[GOHAN] To a place my dad
used to take me. Follow me!

272
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,875
[OX-KING] Oh, man. I'm gonna
be in so much trouble

273
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:03,791
and I'm hungry.

274
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,583
Gohan? Gohan?

275
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,916
Where'd he go?

276
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,000
Grandpa! See this?

277
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:16,166
[OX-KING]
That a boy! Bring him on up!

278
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,083
We'll take him home with us!

279
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,041
[OX-KING]
Huh?

280
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,000
Goodness! That's one
whopper of a fish!

281
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,083
Your dad would be proud
of you for that one!

282
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,708
Gohan! Look out!

283
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,916
You want this, don't you?

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,083
Well, you'll have to
fight me for it! I'm hungry!

285
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,083
You're serious! Aren't you?

286
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,000
Look, I'll share this with you,
but only if you behave!

287
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,708
Do we have a deal?

288
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,166
Man! What a feisty, old bird!

289
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,583
Yeah, what an unlucky bird!

290
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,541
First, he runs into the
strongest guy in the world

291
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,625
in the middle of nowhere,

292
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,291
and then he tries
to take his fish!

293
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,916
[BULMA] Look, Mom!
Look, Dad! He's doing it!

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,958
I can't believe it!

295
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,875
[MRS. BRIEF]
Oh, my goodness!

296
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,791
[MRS. BRIEF]
Yay! What a little champion!

297
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,083
[BULMA]
That's it!

298
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,958
[MRS. BRIEF] Come here,
you poor baby! Goodness! Uhh?

299
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,333
What a stubborn little guy!

300
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,583
I don't think he gets
that from our side!

301
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,166
You're a tough guy
like your daddy, aren't you?

302
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,333
Well, come on! Let's see it!

303
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,875
Get up! You can do it, Trunks!

304
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,583
Now turn into a Super Saiyan!

305
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,916
[MRS. BRIEF] Isn't it a little
too early for that, Dear?

306
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,166
Hello! Welcome, folks!

307
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,166
Without further delay,
it's time to begin our special!

308
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,625
Whoo! And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

309
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,958
the hosts of our show,

310
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,166
Burt and Lana Yakamoori!
Come on! Let's hear it!

311
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,291
Give it up! Give it up
for Burt and Lana!

312
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,708
[ANNOUNCER] Righty, right!
Welly, well! Bring them on!

313
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,166
Good evening, everyone!

314
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,500
[LANA] Tonight, we have
a very special guest!

315
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:33,541
The man who saved
the world! Mr. Satan!

316
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,583
[BURT] Or so he claims!
Some say he didn't do it!

317
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,125
[LANA]
But Mr. Satan has vowed

318
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,708
to silence his
skeptics tonight with

319
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:43,333
a demonstration of super-human
strength that can't be denied!

320
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:48,125
[BURT] So let's hear it, for the
one and only, Hercule Satan!

321
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,333
[MR. SATAN yells]

322
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,708
What a loud mouth, my gosh!

323
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,791
[OOLONG] Listen to those idiots!
They're eating it up!

324
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,166
[BURT] And now, for the moment
you've been waiting for, folks!

325
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,125
Mr. Satan is going
to attempt to break

326
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,791
twenty bricks with
a single blow!

327
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,708
Unbelievable!
Can we have quiet, please?

328
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,791
We need absolute quiet--

329
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah!

330
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:16,625
[BURT]
Maybe not!

331
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,791
Mister Satan! Twenty bricks!

332
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,375
My goodness! That's
quite an undertaking!

333
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,958
Whether you defeated Cell
or not, you're one powerful man!

334
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,166
I defeated Cell, Burt!
And that's that!

335
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,375
And if this doesn't prove it,
I don't know what will!

336
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,958
Alright! Alright!

337
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,583
You heard it right here!
Hercule Satan!

338
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,750
The man who saved the world is
here to set the record straight!

339
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,958
Quiet, please!

340
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,500
Haa! Gotcha!

341
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, all you
little punks at home!

342
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,125
Don't try this or you
might get hurt! You dig it?

343
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:53,375
The pass is complete and now
it's time for the touchdown!

344
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,583
Folks! This is what
you've been waiting for!

345
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,333
Mister Satan will
now try to break

346
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,791
twenty bricks with
a single blow!

347
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,791
[BURT]
Can we have quiet, please?

348
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,291
We need to have complete silence
for this incredible feat!

349
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:25,791
[MR. SATAN yells]

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,958
[BURT] Unbelievable!
Unbelievable! Nineteen bricks!

351
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,750
Mr. Satan has broken nineteen
bricks with a single blow!

352
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,583
A new world record, folks!

353
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's hear it for the
strongest man in the world!

354
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,333
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah! Oh yeah! Come on!

355
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:49,000
[MR. SATAN]
Yeah, Hercule, Mr. Satan--

356
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,791
Who cares what they
call me? I'm huge!

357
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,291
Being a celebrity
can be painful!

358
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,041
[KING KAI]
I can't believe that guy!

359
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,416
Taking all the credit
for your hard work!

360
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,958
It's despicable! Mmmm!

361
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,125
He's a cheat!

362
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,583
But, you know what?
He's a really good actor!

363
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,625
[KING KAI] Well, I'm not
amused! Imagine that face

364
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,166
on a cereal box!

365
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,958
Yeah! Man! I can see
it now, Hercule Puffs!

366
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:29,000
My! That is funny! Oh, Goku?

367
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,875
Hm? You rang?

368
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:34,250
Why, yes! Don't you think
it's time we built a house?

369
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,458
We need one!

370
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,375
Well, yeah! But that
takes some real skill!

371
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,166
Where can we find someone
who knows how to build?

372
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
Hm! Why, right here!

373
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,791
Oh! You mean Bubbles!

374
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,541
I didn't know
Bubbles was that smart!

375
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,125
You mean, Gregory?

376
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,125
I mean me, ya big dummy! M. E.

377
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,583
Oh! Why didn't you say so?

378
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,166
He did!

379
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,166
I never knew
you were that smart!

380
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,791
Gosh! A real builder, huh?

381
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,000
So, uh, how do we
get started, King Kai?

382
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:13,791
Well, I'm glad you asked that!

383
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:16,666
Oooh! Here we go! Come on!

384
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,375
Ah, yes! There we are!
Choice lumber!

385
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,291
Really?

386
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:30,791
[KING KAI] Well, let's
get started, shall we?

387
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,125
Come on! What are
you waiting for?

388
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,250
[NARRATOR] As Goku and King Kai
break ground on their new house,

389
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,208
Trunks heads downstream on
the mystical river of time,

390
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,458
thinking of the serious
tasks that await him

391
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:49,875
upon his arrival!

392
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:53,625
