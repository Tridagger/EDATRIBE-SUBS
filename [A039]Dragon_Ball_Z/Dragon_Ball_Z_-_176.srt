00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,583
the fighters began to gather for
the start of Cell's tournament.

3
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,541
And who better
to arrive first

4
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:23,125
but World Famous
Champion-Of-Show, Mr. Satan!

5
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,666
And he was quick
to announce his plans!

6
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,541
Cell was not amused.

7
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,791
[ANNOUNCER laughs]

8
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,958
[ANNOUNCER] Hey, Cell,
get a load of this one!

9
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,375
[NARRATOR] While Mr. Satan
and his announcer sidekick

10
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,500
continued their moronic taunts,
Vegeta appeared at ringside.

11
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,458
And judging from
his cold expression,

12
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,541
he was determined to
make up for his last defeat.

13
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,166
[NARRATOR] Next to land was
the newly rebuilt Android 16.

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,625
And the others
were soon to follow.

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,333
Flying in close formation,

16
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,375
It was an impressive entrance
that had even Cell reacting

17
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:00,750
as he saw for the first time

18
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,583
all the competition
he would be up against.

19
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,333
[NARRATOR] And as far
as Cell was concerned,

20
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,500
only one question remained:

21
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,916
who would fight him first?

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Goku seemed like a shoe-in,

23
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:19,916
but the hard-headed Mr. Satan
was quick to demonstrate

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
that he would start things off.

25
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,958
Goku and his friends
were baffled,

26
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,500
but a choice must
quickly be made...

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,250
Because, as Cell
has made it clear...

28
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,708
[CELL] It's time!

29
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,208
[NARRATOR]
The fight begins today!

30
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,208
Who will be the
first to challenge?

31
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,791
You're looking at him,
let's get it on!

32
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,500
There's no use in trying to stop
him, Goku. He just won't listen.

33
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:16,375
I've gotta try!

34
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,708
Listen, Mr. Satan,
if you fight Cell,

35
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,458
you're going to get killed!

36
00:04:25,708 --> 00:04:27,291
[MR. SATAN sighs,
ANNOUNCER chuckles]

37
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:31,291
Okay, Lionel, get a close-up
of the guy with the big hair.

38
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,500
[LIONEL] Right!

39
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,291
[ANNOUNCER] Are we on? Good...

40
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,791
Just moments ago this
long-haired guy

41
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:39,916
had the audacity to tell the
people's hero, Hercule Satan,

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,708
to back down
from the tournament!

43
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,750
Imagine, telling the Martial
Arts Champion of the World

44
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,375
he was going to be beaten!

45
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:49,000
Having followed Mr. Satan's
amazing career over the years,

46
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,916
I have one question to
ask this know-it-all brat...

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Who do you think you are?!

48
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,500
Sir, that blonde guy's quite
the dummy, wouldn't you say?

49
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:17,333
I know him.

50
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:21,250
Or someone who looked...
like him.

51
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,458
Many years ago, there was
a young lad who saved the Earth

52
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,125
from the Evil King Piccolo.

53
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,500
I've never forgotten
the innocent look

54
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,541
on that boy's face.

55
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,000
Hmm...

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,458
[KING FURRY] But his eyes,
his eyes were different,

57
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,916
and so was the
color of his hair.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, maybe I'm just
getting old

59
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,125
and my memory isn't
what it used to be.

60
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,875
And yet, somehow
I know it must be him.

61
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,833
Ahh, look at the green one.

62
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:57,833
I'm sure he looks
just like King Piccolo!

63
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:01,583
If that doofus wants to
fight Cell first, then let him!

64
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,375
If he packs it in
we can just revive him

65
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:04,833
with the Dragon Balls.

66
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:10,083
Well, there seems
to be no other choice...

67
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,208
[ANNOUNCER] They've finally
decided not to interfere!

68
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,541
And for those of you
watching this unfold,

69
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,541
you've got to be ecstatic!

70
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,458
It's time for our champ!

71
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,708
You're gonna LOVE this!

72
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,291
[ANNOUNCER] So let's
set the scene!

73
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,166
The first up will be Mr. Satan,
who, of course, will win,

74
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,166
and then the Earth will be
saved from total destruction!

75
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,833
[WOMAN] Hold on, everybody!

76
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,916
It's time to get happy!

77
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,625
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, could it be?

78
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:41,125
[WOMAN] That's right!
The fabulous duo is here!

79
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,583
One's got strength,
one's got grace,

80
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,625
and EVERYBODY'S got the love!

81
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,458
Love? For what?

82
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,875
[WOMAN giggles]

83
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:06,625
It looks like we have
new challengers to take on Cell!

84
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:09,708
But who are they
and where are they from?

85
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:13,083
Must be National Goofball Day!

86
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,083
[MAN A] We are the
students of Maestro Satan!

87
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,541
Yes...

88
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:25,291
Gaze upon me. I am Caroni.

[PIROZHKI] And I am the
stupendous power-man Pirozhki!

92
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,833
Could these
possibly be

93
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:46,833
the often talked-about
Satan's apprentices?

94
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,291
[WOMAN] That's right,
my friend!

95
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:51,083

disciples of Mr. Satan's

World-Renowned
Martial Arts Dojo!

97

So let's pave the way for our
raw man of muscle, Pirozhki.

And our dashing
speedster Caroni!

00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,416
That's great! And who are you?

00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,916
I am their spectacular

Maestro, please
let us take care of him.

103

There's no point in your
fighting this... sissy.

[PIROZHKI grunts]

105
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,041
[PIROZHKI] I will crush him up!

106
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:20,166
Hmm, you're right...

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,666
It could be a little
embarrassing for me

108
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,833
to take on such
an amateur as Cell!

109
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,250
He's all yours!

You heard it right here, folks!
We have some new challengers!

112
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,583
And this dynamic duo will
replace their mentor

113
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,291
in round one.
What a turn of events!

114
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is great news!

115
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,583
With the help of Mr. Satan's
devoted students,

00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,041
how can we fail?!

117
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,708
We can't lose!

118
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,375
I've seen those
two in a magazine!

119
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,000
From what I understand,

120
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,000
as a tag team, they've
never lost a match

121
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,166
in their whole career!

122
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,958

in the white spandex jump
suit, the lovely... Caroni!

we've had to fight or what not,

won't go more than one round!

from the ring, give up,

You're the best!

177
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,250
I agree!

178
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,750
[CARONI sobs]

179
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:52,750
[CROWD murmurs]

180
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
[ANNOUNCER] Caroni, the first
challenger in the Cell Games,

181
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,333
has lost by falling
out of the ring!

182
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,208
How terrible!

183
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,291
[PIROZHKI grunts]

184
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,500
[PIROZHKI] Now it is my turn!

185
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:13,500
[PIROZHKI yells]

186
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,208
Isn't he something?

187
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:18,083
Pirozhki has the strength
of twenty elephants,

188
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,166
and he absolutely
loves to crush things!

189
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,708
I'd say he came
to the right place!

190
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:29,208
[PIROZHKI growls]

191
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,375
[grunting, creaking]

192
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,208
[ANNOUNCER] Look at
his brute strength!

193
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,166
I've never seen
anything like that!

194
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,708
It looks like Cell's
met his match!

195
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,791
Get ready for round two!

196
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,000
There's no way Pirozhki will
mess things up like Caroni did.

197
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,041
I feel sorry for Cell.

198
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,000
[PIROZHKI yells]

199
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,875
[PIROZHKI yells]

200
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes!

201
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,750
It seems Pirozhki
can smell a victory!

202
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,625
And he's doing
his special attack,

203
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,708
called the "Megaton
Bull Crusher!"

204
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,416
And no one has
ever survived it before!

205
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,083
[PIROZHKI yelling]

206
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:46,875
Huh?!

207
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,166
[PIROZHKI grunts]

208
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,333
[ANNOUNCER] What's going on?!

209
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:03,125
It appears Pirozhki's feet
weigh fifty tons each!

210
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:08,166
[PIROZHKI grunting]

211
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,625
[grunting continues]

212
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,375
I give up!

213
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,583
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, great goodness!

214
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,583
[PIROZHKI whimpers]

215
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,250
[PIIZA gasps]

216
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,500
So how are we supposed
to explain this one?

217
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,958
Mr. Satan?

218
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,083
Another trick!

219
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,500
[BOTH] Huh?

220
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,708
You don't see the
forest for the trees!

221
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,875
It's obvious to me that he's
somehow rigged the ring.

222
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,625
Case in point!

223
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,708
Maybe Cell rubbed himself
down with jalepeno peppers,

224
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,375
which Pirozhki is allergic to!

225
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,833
Or maybe he planted
magnets underneath the ring!

226
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,875
But I am gonna find out
what sort of tricks he's up to!

227
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,875
Yes, I see, so it was Cell's
dirty tricks that beat them!

228
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,500
And I think Mr. Satan's
got a few tricks

229
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,375
of his own up his sleeve!

230
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,625
How thick can they really be?

231
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:18,083
Cell's energy flicked them
away, not some stupid trick!

232
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,208
It's like talking to a wall!

233
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,750
[ANNOUNCER] This is it, folks!

234
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,750
Mr. Satan has had enough!

235
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,083
He's stepping into the ring

236
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,958
and is about to
finish Cell off himself.

237
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:31,208
He's taking off his cape,

238
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:36,166
and he's holding up
his champion fighting belt!

239
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,583
Now it looks like the
real battle's about to begin!

240
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,291
In the next few minutes,

241
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,916
the fate of the entire Earth
will be decided between Cell,

242
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,708
and the undisputed Martial
Arts Champion of the World!

243
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,333
And I'm not too worried
because Mr. Satan promised

244
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:56,041
to give Cell a hand
through the stomach!

245
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,958
[ANNOUNCER] What's this?

246
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,000
Mr. Satan is reaching into his
robe and pulling something out!

247
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,666
It looks like a... a capsule!

248
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,291
[ANNOUNCER] Look! A travel bag!

249
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,833
What will those clever folks
at Capsule Corporation

250
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:17,958
think of next?

251
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,583
Well, here we go, everyone...

252
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,958
Mr. Satan is unzipping
the bag and reaching in.

253
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:23,833
A-ha!

254
00:17:23,916 --> 00:17:26,291
They look like ceramic tiles!

255
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,791
The champ is now carefully
piling up the tiles.

256
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,833
[KRILLIN sighs]

257
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,250
[KRILLIN] That guy's
a real moron.

258
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,125
This guys... an idiot.

259
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:39,291
[ANNOUNCER] He's now making
a stack fifteen tiles high!

260
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,083
[MR. SATAN yells]

261
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,666
[lauging]

262
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,416
You don't suppose he's going
to break all fifteen tiles

263
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,666
at once, do you?!

264
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,333
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

265
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,875
Oohhhmmm...

266
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:58,375
[ANNOUNCER] He's now gone
into a trance-like state...

267
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:02,708
I believe he is focusing his
energy for something incredible!

268
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,791
Let's see what happens...

269
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,750
[MR. SATAN] Oohhhmmm...

270
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,041
Mmmmm...

271
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:20,916
Oohhhmmm...

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,916
[MR. SATAN growls]

273
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,666
[yelling]

274
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,083
[ANNOUNCER]
Oh no! One tile is left!

275
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,208
But-But what a
mind-blowing power!

276
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,583
Fourteen tiles all at once!

277
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:43,666
I'm sure any other man would
struggle with two or three!

278
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,166
Incredible!

279
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,666
Phew!

280
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,333
[MR. SATAN yells]

281

282
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,833
[yelling continues]

283
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:13,333
[thinking]
His ignorance is painful.

284
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:17,916
Cell! You see these pieces of
busted tile on the ground?!

285
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,333
[MR. SATAN chuckles]

286
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,958
Well, that's...
what I'm gonna do...

287
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,625
to your face!

288
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,291
[CROWD cheers]

289
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,958
[chanting] Mr. Satan! Mr. Satan!

00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,791
[chanting &amp; cheering continues]

00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,416
[ANNOUNCER sobs]

292
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,583
There's no question!

293
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,916
Hercule Satan
is the undisputed

294
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,958
Martial Arts Champion
of the World!

295
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,000
[thinking] Yeah, I am that good!

296
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,750
I'm just glad I remembered
to set the VCR at home

297
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,416
to record this special moment!

298
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,375
[ANNOUNCER] Oh, it looks like
Cell is getting worried!

299
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,625
But, then again, who wouldn't

300
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,083
after seeing such
an amazing display of power?!

301
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,458
This is getting good!

302
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,500
It's payback time, folks!

303
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,375
Cell's made his ring and
now he's got to sleep in it!

304
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,083
Let's go!

305
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,416
It looks like our hero
is ready to fight!

306
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,833
It's hard to believe
that Mr. Satan's iron hands

307
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,291
are finally going to
have their revenge on Cell

308
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,208
for what he's done
to the people of Earth!

309
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,166
In mere moments
it will all be over

310
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,500
so don't you
dare blink an eye!

311
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:36,333
[CROWD cheers]

312
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,916
[ANNOUNCER] It's all
up to you, Mr. Satan!

313
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,583
We're counting on you!

314
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,666
[MR. SATAN yells]

315
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,625
[ANNOUNCER] Nice move!

316
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,083
I can't believe it!

317
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,041
It looked like the champ
went straight for

318
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,666
his tried and true
patented "Dynamite Kick!"

319
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,375
[MR. SATAN growls]

320
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:05,250
[MR. SATAN yells]

321
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,875
[ANNOUNCER] Mr. Satan
is absolutely amazing!

322
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,083
The man never rests!

323
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,958
He just keeps on attacking!

324
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,208
Look at his speed!

325
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,208
His agility!

326
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,291
It's a veritable
ballet of punches!

327
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:18,083
He's too fast for Cell
to even fight back!

328
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,708
This is amazing!

329
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,291
[MR. SATAN laughs]

330
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:29,333
Now for my finish!

331
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,208
[MR. SATAN screams]

332
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,083
Uhhh...

333
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,250
[KRILLIN chuckles]

334
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,083
To be honest, Gohan,

335
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,541
I was cheering for Cell
to win that little scrap.

336
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:52,208
[MR. SATAN groans]

337
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,958
[PICCOLO] Hmph. Look,
he survived...

338
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,583
I guess Cell didn't want
to waste any energy

339
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,125
on that weakling.

340
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,416
He... He landed
outside the ring...

341
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,041
That means... our hero...
has lost the battle...

342
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:25,041
So... let's get the
tournament underway.

343
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:31,125
Who will be first? Will it
be Goku to start things off?

344
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,625
Let's do it!

345
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:47,166
[NARRATOR] After all the talk,
all the training,

346
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,083
all the idle threats, the
hour has finally arrived.

347
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:55,291
It's Goku versus Cell next time.
