1
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:14,958
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,375
Vegeta summoned all of
his strength into one

3
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,375
ultimate energy blast

4
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:21,708
and fired it directly at Cell.

5
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:27,875
[NARRATOR] When the smoke
cleared, Vegeta saw that he had

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:34,583
indeed hit his mark and
disarmed Cell, literally!

7
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,666
[VEGETA laughs]

8
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,833
[NARRATOR] But Vegeta's
celebration was soon cut short,

9
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,000
as Cell demonstrated
his powers of regeneration.

10
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:49,458
Sprouting a new arm, Cell was
ready for battle once again,

11
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:53,458
and Vegeta found himself
in a very dangerous situation.

12
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:58,250
[VEGETA shouting]

13
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,708
[NARRATOR] Despite all of
his new Saiyan powers,

14
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,416
Vegeta could not make a dent
in Cell's monstrous armor.

15
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:10,625
[NARRATOR] But he
definitely made an impact.

16
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,625
[NARRATOR] With his father
knocked unconscious,

17
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,666
Trunks was ready at last
to unveil his hidden power

18
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,708
and take his turn at Cell.

19
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,083
[TRUNKS grunts]

20
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,750
[NARRATOR] But can
this young warrior

21
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,875
find the strength
to save Vegeta

22
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,916
and battle Cell
all by himself?

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,291
Find out today
on Dragon Ball Z!

24
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:03,333
[TRUNKS grunts]

25
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,958
[TRUNKS yells]

26
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:20,583
[TRUNKS growls]

27
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,708
[KRILLIN whimpers]

28
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,166
[CELL] Hmm...

29
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:38,833
[TRUNKS grunts]

30
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:56,916
[grunting continues]

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,375
What's this?!

32
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,791
[KRILLIN] Trunks...?
Is everything okay...?

33
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:18,750
Wow! Amazing! His strength
keeps growing and growing!

34
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,750
Trunks wasn't kidding! He really
is stronger than Vegeta now!

35
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,000
Hey, Trunks! Can you hear me?!

36
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,708
What's happening to you?!

37
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,875
Wow! These Saiyans
are incredible!

38
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,500
They just keep on growing!

39
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,916
Every enemy they face takes
them to a new level of power!

40
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,208
Now, it's Trunks' turn.

41
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,625
[KRILLIN gasps]

42
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,625
Hey, Krillin.

43
00:05:56,708 --> 00:06:00,041
I've got a plan... but
I need you to take my father to

44
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,291
Master Roshi's house
so he can recover.

45
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,958
[KRILLIN sighs]

46
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,083
You bet! Man, what a relief!

47
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:11,541
Trunks, I sure am glad you're
still one of the good guys!

48
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,416
For a minute there I thought you
were gonna pull a Gohan

49
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,333
and go ape!

50
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,458
Don't worry, I'm alright.

51
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,625
[TRUNKS] Just make sure
my father gets this.

52
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,291
It should be enough
to restore his strength

53
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,958
and get him back on his feet.

54
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,875
But, Trunks! What about you?

55
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,083
This is the last Senzu bean.
What if you need it?

56
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,500
I have no use for it, Krillin.

57
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,875
I don't plan on losing.

58
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:49,791
Well, I really hope you
don't either. Good luck, Trunks!

59
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:57,916
[thinking] Hmm... I wonder
what Trunks has to offer me?

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,750
His power level
has taken a sudden jump.

61
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,458
[thinking] Maybe I will
finally have a challenge.

62
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,083
[CELL] Hmph.

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
[CELL] Don't you think Vegeta
is right where he belongs?

64
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,166
With his face in the mud?

65
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,000
[CELL chuckles]

66
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,166
It's all over, Cell!

67
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,166
Well, I've heard
that one before.

68
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,791
[CELL chuckles]

69
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,750
[CELL] You Saiyans
are like cockroaches.

70
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,500
Squash one and another
crawls out from the wall!

71
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:29,958
[CELL] You know you'll face
the same fate as your father!

72
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,625
[TRUNKS] I don't think so.
Not this time.

73
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,541
[ANDROID 16] Did that boy not
see what happened to Vegeta?

74
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,583
[KRILLIN gulps]

75
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,333
[TRUNKS grunts]

76
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,208
What?!

77
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,000
They disappeared!
Where'd they go?!

78
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,750
I can't see them anywhere!

79
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,416
Huh--?!

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,375
[TRUNKS growls]

81
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,625
What was that?!

82
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,583
Wait! I don't see Cell and
Trunks is still standing!

83
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,458
There's no doubt about it.

84
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,625
All that training in the
Hyperbolic Time Chamber

85
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,958
really paid off!

86
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,500
Trunks must be the
strongest fighter

87
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,250
in the universe right now!

88
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,875
[GOKU] Ready to test
your new powers, Gohan?

89
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,708
[GOHAN] Yeah, I'm ready, Dad.

90
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:25,666
Alright... now catch me...
do whatever it takes.

91
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,500
[GOHAN growls]

92
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,666
[GOHAN]
There's no use hiding, Dad!

93
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,958
You know I can
sense where you are!

94
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,416
[GOHAN] Raaah!

95
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:04,083
That's the way! But you'll
have to do better than that!

96
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,708
[GOHAN growls]

97
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,333
Whew! Close one!

98
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,208
[GOKU gasps]

99
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,208
[GOHAN shouting]

100
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:30,666
[GOKU squeals]

101
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,125
[gasps]

102
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,458
[GOHAN] Gotcha!

103
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,791
[GOKU] Huh?

104
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,875
[GOHAN] How was that?

105
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,458
Not bad.

106
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,666
How about a quick break?

107
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,500
Yeah!

108
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,083
[GOKU laughs]

109
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,375
Well, at least
you missed the fridge.

110
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:12,833
Oops! Sorry about that.

111
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,416
[GOKU] We'd better
fix this place up

112
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,583
before Mr. Popo sees it.

113
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,541
[GOHAN laughs]

114
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,250
[GOHAN] Yeah, I guess so!

115
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,416
[KRILLIN laughs]

116
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,958
[KRILLIN] Alright!
Trunks did it!

117
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,791
That's great!
I never would have guessed

118
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,041
that he would
be the one to beat Cell!

119
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait 'til I tell
the other guys!

120
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,416
Way to go, Trunks!

121
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,916
[KRILLIN laughs]

122
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,083
Krillin, no! Look out!

123
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,875
[KRILLIN] Trun--!

124
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,333
Oh no!

125
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:05,500

126

[KRILLIN whimpers]

128
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,916
[CELL] I know what
you're thinking.

129
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,875
I'm just a nightmare
that won't go away!

130
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:50,041
Well, wake up, Trunks. I'm real.

131
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,250
[KRILLIN] This guy
is way too creepy!

132
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,750
I don't know what's worse.
Seeing him or hearing him!

133
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,666
[CELL] I said it before,
I'll say it again.

134
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,458
You Saiyans don't know
when to give up.

135
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,916
[CELL chuckles]

136
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,541
[CELL] You have a
strong fighting spirit.

137
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,750
I will enjoy draining you of it!

[KRILLIN] Oh man!

143
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:42,750
Cell will destroy him!

144
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,125
Huh?

145
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:59,833
[KRILLIN] Whoa... They're
really tearing it up!

[TRUNKS thinking] I must
keep Cell's attention

151
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,166
away from my father!

152
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,958
Well done, Trunks.

153
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,500
I see you've learned
all of Vegeta's moves.

154
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,416
[CELL] Now let me demonstrate
how to do them properly!

[KRILLIN] No, Trunks!
You can't let him win!

Trunks! Please! Get up!

[KRILLIN] Huh...?

164
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,875
[KRILLIN] Huh?

165
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:17,750
[thinking] What is he
trying to tell me?

166
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:23,583
[KRILLIN thinking] Oh...
Of course! Vegeta!

167
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,833
[thinking] Whoa,
he must be letting Cell

168
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,000
hit him as a distraction!

169
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,875

[KRILLIN] This is
for you, Trunks...

173
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,500
[KRILLIN] Vegeta, you helped
Cell become complete

174
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,125
just to satisfy your
own foolish pride...

175
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,583
And look what's happened to you!

176
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,666
Now, Trunks has to fight
that monster all by himself.

177
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,416

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,416
Trunks is giving Cell
everything he's got!

180
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,041
Go on, look!

181
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,541
No! You'll never see
because you've been

182
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,000
blinded by your
own selfish ambition.

183
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:43,083
I don't know why Trunks
cares so much about you.

184
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:46,416
But I'm going to keep my
word and get you out of here!

185
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:05,750
Trunks! I really hope
Vegeta is worth all of this!

186
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,208
Good luck.

187
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,083
[CELL] What's that saying?
"Like father like son?"

188
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:33,375
Yes! You are as
headstrong as Vegeta,

189
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,666
but soon you'll be wishing
your head was stronger,

190
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,625
when I'm crushing it.

191
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
[CELL laughs]

192
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,833
[KRILLIN] Trunks
alone with Cell?!

193
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,708
Aw, I don't like
those odds at all!

194
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,000
[TRUNKS chuckles]

195
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,291
[CELL chuckles]

196
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,416
Looks like you've
saved Vegeta for now!

197
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,750
Huh?!

198
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:19,500
What? Thought I didn't see, huh?

199
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,791
[TRUNKS growls]

200
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,333
Why'd you let me?

201
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:26,083
[CELL] Isn't it obvious? I'm
interested in you, not him.

202
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,333
I can kill him any time I want.

203
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,125
[TRUNKS] Not if I can help it!

204
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,375
[CELL] Your loyalty
to your father

205
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,791
is a sign of weakness, Trunks!

206
00:20:38,875 --> 00:20:41,458
It will be your downfall.

207
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,708
[CELL] But enough about
your weakling father.

208
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:57,666
I'd much rather address
my fight with you.

209
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,125
[TRUNKS growls]

210
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,625
You want me? Come and get me!

211
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:13,666
I will, but show me more of that
wonderful power of yours first.

212
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:19,375
[TRUNKS growls]

213
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,375
[CELL chuckles]

214
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,666
[CELL] That's it!
Take your time!

215
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,958
I want you to be at full
strength when I destroy you!

216
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,833
No! This can't be real!

217
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,958
Trunks is going through
an incredible transformation...

218
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:37,333
His power is now
far greater than Vegeta's!

219
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,083
It's true. I didn't want to
believe it, but I guess there

220
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,666
really is a level beyond
that of a Super Saiyan!

221
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:58,375
[TRUNKS growls]

222
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,583
[ANDROID 16 thinking]
So this is the boy's secret.

223
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,333
[TRUNKS growls]

224
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:12,333
[NARRATOR] Fueled by rage, and
ready to sacrifice it all,

225
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,791
Trunks has squared off against
Cell in one final bout.

226
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,666
WIth his energy continuing to
build, Trunks has surpassed

227
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,708
the fighting powers of all the
other heroes!

228
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,583
[TRUNKS growling]

229
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,375
[NARRATOR] Perhaps
his intensive training

230
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:31,541
in the Hyperbolic Time
Chamber was all he needed?

231
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,791
But Cell is definitely not
going to be defeated easily.

232
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,708
[NARRATOR] Two fighters
from the future throw down

233
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,083
to decide the planet's fate,

234
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:46,583
next time on Dragon Ball Z!

235
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:52,625
