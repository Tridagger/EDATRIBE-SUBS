00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:16,166
[NARRATOR] Last time
on Dragon Ball Z,

2
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,291
Supremely confident
in his power,

3
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,833
Frieza vowed to defeat Goku
without using his hands!

4
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,416
But, in issuing
himself this challenge,

5
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,541
it soon became clear that
Frieza had bitten off more

6
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,083
than he could chew!

7
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,541
[NARRATOR] Goku continued
to surprise the evil tyrant

8
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,541
with his incredible
strength and blinding speed...

9
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,000
until finally, hard-pressed by
the Saiyan's flurry of attacks,

10
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,375
Frieza was left
with one recourse...

11
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,833
So, I guess you had to
use your hands after all.

12
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:57,875
[FRIEZA growls]

13
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,958
[GOKU chuckles]

14
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,083
[FRIEZA giggles]

15
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:04,625
Okay, from now on,
the deal's off.

16
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,583
[GOKU] Yeah, well, I sort of
gathered that much already!

17
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,875
[FRIEZA] Oh, my! I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:13,833
Yeah, I'll bet! Well, don't
go losing any sleep over it.

19
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:18,000
Shoot! I'm sure that
it was an honest mistake!

20
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:20,375
Thanks, but no thanks.

21
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,458
[NARRATOR] Now, the time
for games at an end,

22
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,208
the two mighty
warriors square off,

23
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,416
ready to begin the battle anew!

24
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
The epic struggle for the fate
of the universe continues today,

25
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,458
on Dragon Ball Z!

26
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
[FRIEZA] I really hate
to break this to you,

27
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,625
but I've been holding
back the lion's share

28
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,375
of my power for the
sake of amusement.

29
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,541
But now I'm going
to end this fight.

30
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:07,250
But before I do, I'd
like to make you an offer:

31
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,458
[GOKU] I'm listening.

32
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,958
[FRIEZA] Join me.

33
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,458
You have so much potential,
it would be a pity

34
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,291
to see it snuffed out
and gone to waste.

35
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,208
What d'ya say?

36
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,291
I can't do it, sorry.

37
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,708
See, I have this nasty
habit of following my heart.

38
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,833
And what does
that get you?

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,125
With me you would
live like a god.

40
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,791
Yes, you could have anything.

41
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,625
Or not. You could
choose to suffer and die.

42
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,166
Your call...

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,500
No way.

44
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,458
I have everything
that a man could want.

45
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,083
[FRIEZA] Oh-ho-ho, my!

46
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,000
You are so naive.

47
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,666
You know nothing of the
pleasures of this Universe!

48
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,833
Any desire that you have
could be instantly fulfilled!

49
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,500
But have it your way.

50
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:00,791
Die if you must.

51
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,083
But allow me to let you
in on a little secret.

52
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,875
Hm? What's that?

53
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,250
Well... I haven't even begun
to use my real power yet.

54
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,583
[GOKU] Yeah, well I have
some reserves myself!

55
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:13,958
Yes, I know.

56
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,333
Five.

57
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,916
Five times what
you've displayed.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,375
Ten at the very most.

59
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,666
But I... I've only used
one percent of my power.

60
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,666
Huh? What? No way!

61
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,291
You're bluffing!

62
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,250
It's just not possible!

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,333
Don't be glum.

64
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,791
You should actually
be flattered.

65
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,250
I've never had to summon
this much of my power

66
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,291
to defeat someone.

67
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,916
Fifty percent
of my maximum.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,791
That's all that's
required for this.

69
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,708
[FRIEZA giggles]

70
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,375
[GOKU growls]

71
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,625
I guess when you
realize this could be

72
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:13,000
your last fight, there's
no hurry to start.

73
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:13,916
[GOHAN gasps]

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,125
[PICCOLO] No kidding.

75
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,791
We've all experienced
that feeling before.

76
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,208
It's not easy.

77
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,458
But Goku seems to have
a knack for handling

78
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,458
this type of situation.

79
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:28,541
Do you think my Dad
can pull this one off?

80
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,000
It's hard
to tell, Gohan.

81
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,125
At this point,
both their powers

82
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:41,000
have gone beyond
our imagination!

83
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,458
That is true...

84
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:54,750
[GINYU laughing]

85
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,791
[GINYU] Love it!

86
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,708
[laughing continues]

87
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,250
[GINYU grunts]

88
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,666
[GINYU laughs]

89
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,291
[BULMA] Ribbit... Ribbit...

90
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,041
[BULMA thinking]
Who is this monster?!

91
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,166
How could he do this to me?!

92
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,625
I'm going to get him back
if it's the last thing I do!

93
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,333
[GINYU] Well, look
what we have here!

94
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:16,958
A stow-away, huh?!

95
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,208
Hmm...

96
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:22,250
This oughta take care
of the toad problem!

97
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,250
[GINYU laughing]

98
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,500
[BULMA screaming]

99
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,208
[GINYU laughing]

100
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,083
[thinking] I hate her!
She's obnoxious!

101
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,583
Wicked body-snatcher!

102
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,666
What did I do to deserve this?!

103
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,916
[BULMA sobs]

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,750
[BULMA screams]

105
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,208
[GINYU] Whoo-hooo!

106
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,791
[GINYU laughs]

107
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,500
[BULMA thinking] That does it!

108
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,583
Forget this! I can't
take it anymore!

109
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,458
Geronimooo!

110
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,000
[GINYU laughing]

111
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,000
Huh?! Wait-- What're you doing?!

112
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,541
Are you crazy?! I can't see!

113
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,083
[GINYU] Let go of me!

114
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,583
I hate frogs!

115
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,208
What are you doing?!

116
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,125
[PICCOLO] What th--?!

117
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:13,833
[GINYU screams]

118
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,708
[GINYU] Get off of me!

119
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,375
Whoaaa! I'm too young to die!

120
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,625
[GINYU] Let go of me!
I'm going to kill you!

121
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,083
[PICCOLO] Look out!

122
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,875
[BULMA grunts]

123
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,541
I still got it!

124
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,625
She's still got what?

125
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,208
[KRILLIN] Uhh, hey, Bulma!

126
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,791
What's going on?

127
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,291
I know you're mad at us for
leaving you by yourself,

128
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,416
but it's really not safe
for you to be here.

129
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,708
[GINYU chuckles]

130
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,500
Bulma...?

131
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,208
Are you okay...?

132
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,041
Did you get hit on
the head or something?

133
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,791
[high-pitched GINYU]
Hey, what's that?

134
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,625
That's where Goku and
Frieza are fighting...

135
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:33,791
[high-pitched GINYU]
Really?! Wow! There they are!

136
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,666
[KRILLIN] Hey! Bulma, no! Wait!

137
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,833
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh, my!
This is fantastic!

138
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,291
[GINYU giggles]

139
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,916
Ooh, yes.
Now I'm stoked.

140
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,000
You're choosing
to die

141
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,250
instead of joining me?

142
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,500
It's a real shame.

143
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,708
[FRIEZA giggles]

144
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,541
Huh?

145
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,125
[FRIEZA] You Saiyans are
really something else.

146
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,458
So proud.

147
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:23,333
So obstinate.

148
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,750
You're just like Vegeta
and Vegeta's father.

149
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,625
And that radical, Bardock.

150
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,708
You're all alike.

151
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:32,666
Too stubborn to
recognize a good deal.

152
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,000
Just like moths, rushing
into a flame to die.

153
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,625
But what can I do?

154
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,750
You leave me no other choice.

155
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,500
[FRIEZA] We could have
been so good together...

156
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,250
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh, yeah!

157
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:05,000
This is going to be one
fabulous show! This is awesome!

158
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,708
[GINYU thinking]
This is strange!

159
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,458
In this body, I can clearly
sense the intensity level

160
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,833
of each of their powers!

161
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,666
Vegeta learned how to
read power levels like this!

162
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,166
[GINYU giggles]

163
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,583
[GINYU] This is great! Ahem..

164
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:18,000
[high-pitched GINYU]
This is great!

165
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,250
Say what?

166
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,125
[KRILLIN] Are you okay, Bulma?

167
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,041
--[BULMA] Ribbit...
--[GOHAN] Hm?

168
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,083
[BULMA thinking] Oh, please!

169
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:30,208
[BULMA] Ribbit... Ribbit-Ribbit?

170
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,375
[GOHAN] What's up?

171
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,583
[BULMA thinking]
Oh, Gohan, it's me, Bulma!

172
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,583
Somehow that fiend
managed to steal my body

173
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:36,625
and now look at me!

174
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,500
It's just awful!

175
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,000
You've got to
help me Gohan!

176
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,416
[high-pitched GINYU]
Enough already!

177
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,708
I want to see some action!

178
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,791
[BULMA thinking]
That's an imposter!

179
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,291
[GOHAN] Hmm...?

180
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,250
Oh, I get it! Yeah!

181
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,708
[BULMA thinking]
Oh, you precious boy!

182
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,625
You really do understand!

183
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,208
You're Captain
Ginyu, right?

184
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,583
[BULMA screams]

185
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,333
You know, it's
not a good idea to

186
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,833
be hanging around here.

187
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,125
Besides, you have a whole
new world to explore!

188
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,291
[BULMA sobs]

189
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,666
[BULMA thinking]
Why me?! This is horrible!

190
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:17,833
[FRIEZA] I am now at fifty
percent of my maximum.

191
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,541
[FRIEZA] With this
increase, your limitations

192
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,041
will soon become apparent.

193
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,166
Oh, my gosh...

194
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,833
He's not bluffing!

195
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,541
[FRIEZA growls]

196
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,750
Huh?!

[GOKU grunts]

198
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:00,625

[GOKU grunts]

200
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,041
[thinking] This isn't
looking too good.

201
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,541
How can I fight him,
if I can't see him?

202
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,416
[GOKU gasps]

203
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,291
[FRIEZA] My, you're edgy.

204
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,458
I was just scratching my nose.

205
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,041

[GOKU grunting]

208
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,875
[FRIEZA] Has it become
clear to you yet?

209
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,666
You never had a chance.

210
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,791
I only let you
think you did.

211
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,875
[PICCOLO] Goku!

212
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,833
[GOHAN] Dad, are you alright?

213
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,375
[GOHAN whimpers]

214
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,458
[high-pitched GINYU] Incredible!

215
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,041
Now that's what I call speed!

216
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,333
I can't believe that
I have the priviledge

217
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,833
of watching this fight!

218
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,500
This is monumental!
What a match-up!

219
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,500
Gosh!

220
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,333
This is his greatest
battle ever!

221
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,875
And here I am to witness it!

222
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,708
Bulma, I know the fight
is a big deal and all,

223
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,250
but it's really not a
time to celebrate!

224
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,083
Bulma?

225
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,666
Goku's not faring too
well at the moment.

226
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,250
--[high-pitched GINYU] Oopsie!
--[KRILLIN grunts]

227

Do me a favor...

228
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,333
After the fight's over
remind me to kill you guys!

229
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,791
[BOTH] Huh?!

230
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,875
[GINYU] Oh!

231
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,708
[high-pitched GINYU giggles]

232
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,833
Well, if she's
threatening us,

233
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,916
that means she's
back to normal.

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,333

[thinking] Man!

237
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,500
How can he be that fast?!

238
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,625
I should at least be
able to follow him!

239
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,916
You should strike. Now,
while my back's turned!

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,083
What's wrong?

241
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:20,958
Don't tell me that the
great Super Saiyan

242
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,083
is throwing in the
towel already?

243
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,625
What a disappointment.

00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,708
[GOKU growls]

245
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,958
[ROSHI] These things hurt
my toes, they're too small!

246
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,375
[YAJIROBE] Here we go!

247
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,625
I bet it's going to
be all up to me again!

248
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,458
[PUAR] Time to buckle down!

249
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,250
[DR. BRIEF] Lift-off
is in ten minutes.

250
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,541
I'm glad you all
could make it!

251
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,791
Yep! Big day! Wow.

[OOLONG grunts]

253
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,416
[OOLONG] Man! I feel like a
real stud in this spacesuit!

254
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,333
[CHICHI] Alright, guys!

255
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,291
Let's do it!

256
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,625
[DR. BRIEF] I'm cutting
the umbilical cord.

257
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,083
Stand back, everybody.

258
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:22,083
[DR. BRIEF] If you
have anything to say,

259
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,375
you'd better say it now!

260
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,250
[OX-KING] ChiChi!
You just get Gohan,

261
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,916
and let Goku handle
the fighting!

262
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,083
Do I make myself clear?

263
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:32,041
[CHICHI] But, Dad,
you don't drink beer!

264
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,833
Bon Voyage, everybody!

Bye-bye! We love you!

[OX-KING] I don't think
she understood me...

[MRS. BRIEF]
Oh, she'll be just fine!

268
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,375
[CHICHI] I've never flown
in outer space before...

269
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,791
My little Gohan is so brave!

270
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,000
Oh, man!

271
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:55,166
I'm feeling a little
claustrophobic. Oh, no!

272
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,416
[PUAR] Oh, Yamcha, we'll wish
you back somehow. I promise.

273
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,875
Come on! Blast-off!

disintegrates!

Alright. This is it.

totally stinks!

this one last time!

mean it this time!

What's wrong?

00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,375
You don't seem to
be having any fun.

307
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:05,416
Loosen up.

It won't be long
now, will it?

00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:45,125
But I commend you for
surviving this long.

[KING KAI] Oh, dear!

00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,916
I'm afraid this
could be it, guys!

316
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,041
He's just too strong!

317
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,083
Yeah, but I bet Goku
is still wearing

318
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,500
his weighted training
clothes, isn't he?

319
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,875
Hmm-mm...

320
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,333
I'm afraid
not, Yamcha.

321
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,500
Goku's giving it
everything he's got.

Wow! This IS serious!

chance, doesn't he, King Kai?

[KING KAI] Well, Chiaotzu...
It's not looking too good.

325
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,666
I can tell you that.

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Huh?!

00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,500
Goku...

331
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:45,250
[TIEN] I wouldn't worry too
much about Goku yet, Chiaotzu!

No sweat...

333
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,875
He's gonna be fine.

00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,416
[YAMCHA] What?

335
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,958
[TIEN] Don't forget, Goku
still has an ace up his sleeve.

336
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,333
Thanks to you.

337
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,166
Goku hasn't used the
Kaio-Ken Attack yet!

338
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,375
He'll set Frieza
straight when he does!

339
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,958
Right on!

343
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,166
[KING KAI] Knock it off!

344
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,208
You're all
being foolish!

345
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,083
[KING KAI] You don't know
what you're talking about!

346
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:19,875
Goku has been using the Kaio-Ken
Attack the entire time!

347
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,083
But now Frieza is
picking him apart,

348
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,333
even when he's fully
energized by the attack!

349
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,625
I don't know how
long he can last...

350
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:31,750
We may have to step in,
so stay on your toes!

351
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,291
Come on, Dad!

352
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,333
[high-pitched GINYU giggles]

353
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,416

This is great!

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
[ALL] Huh?

355
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,083
She's lost it.

356
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,125
[high-pitched GINYU] It looks
like Frieza's going to win

357
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,166
after all!

358
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,666
[high-pitched GINYU giggles]

359
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,083
I should have known!

360
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,166
[PICCOLO] Look!

361
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,750
Shut up or leave!
And that's final!

362
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:47,958
[high-pitched GINYU] Oh!

363
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,083
[KRILLIN] Are you sure
you're okay, Bulma?

364
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,583
[high-pitched GINYU] Yes!

365
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,958
I guess I got carried
away for a second there...

366
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,458
Sorry, guys!

367
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,666
[BULMA whines]

368
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,041
[KRILLIN &amp; GOHAN] Huh?

369
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,750
Hey!

370
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,583
[high-pitched GINYU]
What's the matter, guys...?

371
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,750
Why are you looking
at me so funny?

372
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:19,833
You wouldn't hurt a lady,
would you? Hmmmm?!

373
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,666
[GINYU laughs]

374
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,875
Hey! Look out!

375
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,583
It's Ginyu!

376
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:35,291
[NARRATOR] the situation has
become desperate for Goku!

377
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,416
With the Kaio-Ken Attack

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,666
rendered useless by
Frieza, where does

379
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,250
the mighty Saiyan from
Earth go from here?!

380
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,166
it seems that only
a miracle can save him!

381
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,041
And what does the
shameless body-snatcher

382
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:49,208
Captain Ginyu have in store
for Piccolo and the others?

383
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,541
