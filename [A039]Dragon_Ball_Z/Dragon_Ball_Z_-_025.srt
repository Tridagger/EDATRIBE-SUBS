00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,500
[NARRATOR] Previously,
on Dragon Ball Z!

2
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,125
The battle for the Earth
claimed its first casualty

3
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,333
as Yamcha fell at the hands
of the mindless Saibamen.

4
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:24,458
The two evil Saiyans,
Nappa and Vegeta,

5
00:02:24,541 --> 00:02:26,250
looked on with
cold amusement,

6
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:28,375
as our heroes mourned
the loss of their friend,

7
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,333
eager to see who the
Saibamen would take

8
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,333
as their next victim in the
gruesome game of life-and-death.

9
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,125
But our heroes
stood firm.

10
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,791
Banded together,
and fueled by rage,

11
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,125
they were able to eliminate
the Saibaman threat

12
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,041
and put an end to the
Saiyans' cruel contest.

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,583
And that's when the
horror truly began...

14
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,083
Nappa attacked!

15
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,958
Tien was the
first to receive

16
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,541
the Saiyan's
ruthless attention.

17
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,916
But before Nappa could
close in for the kill,

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,208
Chiaotzu took
drastic action!

19
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,458
[CHIAOTZU using ESP]
I'm not afraid.

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,333
And if I can save you...
that's worth dying for.

21
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,708
Chiaotzu! No!

22
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,000
[NARRATOR] Another of the
Earth's Special Forces

23
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,791
has given his life in
defense of the planet...

24
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,958
Meanwhile, the greatest
hope of all, Goku,

25
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,583
is still on his way
to the battlefield!

26
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:26,916
Hurry, Goku...
Time is running out!

27
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,166
[thinking] Darn it!
I've got a bad feeling...

28
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,208
Things aren't going so
good down on Earth...

29
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,333
But I'm almost there.
I've got to keep it up!

30
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,666

[GOHAN whimpering]

32
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,041
Why, you...
monster!

33
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,666
Guess your little friend
couldn't save you, three eyes!

34
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,125
Aw, man! This is crazy!
What do we do, Piccolo?

35
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:29,208
He's just too strong! There's
no way we can beat this guy!

36
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,666
Stand your ground, Krillin.
We're here for a reason!

37
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,000
[GOHAN trembling]

38
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,000
Chiaotzu!

39
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,625
Wagh!

40
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,375
Heh, heh, heh!
You miss him already, huh?

41
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,583
Well, don't worry.
You'll be joining him soon!

42
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,583
[NAPPA laughing]

43
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,750
'Kay... that's it.
This one's for you, Chiaotzu!

[blows landing, TIEN yelling]

46
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,500
Not bad...

47
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,541
Just look
at him go...

48
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,333
[blows landing, TIEN yelling]

49
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,541

[GOHAN whimpering]

51
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,291
[TIEN] Hyeegh!

52
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,416
[TIEN grunting]

53
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
[TIEN] Aaugh!

54
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,041
[TIEN] Haah!

55
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:44,625
[blows landing, TIEN yelling]

56
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,666
[BULMA] Ooh! C'mon, Tien!
Wow! He's on fire!

57
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,875
[OOLONG] You're not kidding!
He's tearing it up!

58
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,583
Maybe he'll win!

59
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,708
Yes, there's
no question

60
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,875
that Tien is full of
spirit at the moment...

61
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,875
But, I'm afraid he's
fighting on heart alone!

62
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:11,041
I just hope he can
keep this up.

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,166
There it
goes again!

64
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,708
And it's doing the same
thing on every channel!

65
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,000
[TECH MAN] Yeah, we're having
real problems in here, Chief!

66
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,708
We're not picking
up anything!

67
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,750
What's going on
out there, anyway?

68
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,750
[SOUND MAN] Hey! How're we
supposed to work in this storm?

69
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,375
[CAMERA MAN] I hope we're
getting overtime for this!

70

72

Heh, heh, heh!

73
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,916
So, did you wear
yourself out yet?

74
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,666
Or you wanna try a little
more before I stomp you?

75
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:49,583
Raagh!

76
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:53,583
[blows landing]

77
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,666
Amazing! How can he
get up after all of that?

78
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,458
That's it!
I'm going in!

79
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,916
[PICCOLO]
Krillin, wait!

80
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,541
He's going to start
attacking Tien

81
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,875
and when he does he'll
have an unguarded moment.

82
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,000
That's when
we strike.

83
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,125
Alright, good.
Did you get that, Gohan?

84
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,208
Uh-huh...

85
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,416
[VEGETA]
That's a good plan!

86
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,958
Nappa's too strong
to fight head-on!

87
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,541
Don't take your
eyes off them...

88
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:33,291
You'll miss
your opportunity...

89
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,000
Confident, huh?

90
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,500
Well, you just wait until
Goku makes it back.

91
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,083
We'll see if you're
still so cocky.

92
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:43,041
Oh? Interesting...
Who's Goku?

93
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,500
Is he really
that strong?

94
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,666
[PICCOLO chuckling]

95
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,500
You'll find
out soon.

96
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,000
Haah!

97
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,083
Augh!

98
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,208

[GOHAN whimpering]

100
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,166
[PICCOLO] Hold on, Krillin...
Just a few more seconds!

101
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,125
[thinking] This has
to be timed just right.

102
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,416
We've only got
one shot at this.

103
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,750
What's wrong? Oh, wait,
don't tell me!

104
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:18,208
I think I know
what you need!

105
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:22,958
A nice trip to the afterlife!
One way, of course! Heh, heh.

106
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,000
Ready?!

107
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:33,083

124
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,250
Now, Gohan!

00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,875
I'll give you some
credit for that one...

It was a
good move.

You two almost had me there
for a second... Almost.

Too bad for you, your
little trick didn't work.

Now you're
gonna die!

146
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:17,791
[KAMI] I sense the end of my
life is drawing near, Mr. Popo.

147
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,625
I'm afraid that I have little
time left in this world.

148
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:25,500
But Kami!
That means...

149
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,375
Piccolo is
going to die...

150
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:31,833
And I will fade from
existence along with him.

151
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:34,750
[MR. POPO] What about Goku?
He could still save you!

152
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,541
I can't sense
him approaching yet...

153
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:41,750
But you're right, my friend...
He's the only one who can.

154
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,666
No way! That's the
same guy! Hey, Buddy!

just keeps on getting smaller...

just the two of you now!

[NAPPA] All right. Whadda you
say we get down to business?

166
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,583
Who's next?

167
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,208
[VEGETA] Nappa!
We still need the Namek

168
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,500
to tell us about
the Dragon Balls!

169
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,041
Oh yeah, I
almost forgot.

Looks like you're up,
little man!

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,416
Heh. You hear that, Piccolo?
You're in luck.

172
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe I should
tell 'em I know

173
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,166
all about the
Dragon Balls, too...

174
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,791
Be my guest,
but I don't think

175
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
it'll make much
difference in the end.

176
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,625
[KRILLIN] Point taken...

177
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,958
Now, let's try
a direct attack!

178
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,625
Before he powers
up again!

179
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,083
Guh?!

180
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,083
[PICCOLO]
You're familiar with the

181
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,791
Multi-Form technique,
aren't you?

182
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,375
[KRILLIN] Yeah.

183
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,125
[PICCOLO] Well, let's do it!
Both of us.

184
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:39,166
[PICCOLO snarling]

185
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:49,916
[snarling continues]

186
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hnn?

187
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,458
Ngh!

188
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:58,708
Ha! Amateurs...

189
00:13:58,791 --> 00:13:59,791
Ready?!

190
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,708
[ALL] Yeah!

191
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,250
[shouting]

192
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,208
[ALL shouting]

193
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:10,250
[shouting, blows landing]

194
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,416
[fighting sounds continuing]

195
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,833
Raagh!

196
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:21,875
[NAPPA] Haah!

197
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:23,333
[NAPPA yelling, blows landing]

198
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:26,875
Huh?!

199
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,375
Hraagh!

200
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:32,791
[fighting sounds]

201
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,250
[GOHAN] Piccolo!

202
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,083
[GOHAN] Piccolo?

203
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,541
Uwagh! Ngh!

204
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,625
[GOHAN whimpering]

205
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,958
Piccolo, I'm--

206
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,916
[PICCOLO] I have no time
to baby-sit, Gohan.

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,958
If you can't help,
go home to your mother!

208
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,416
Krillin!

209
00:14:58,708 --> 00:14:59,541
[rocks falling]

210
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:00,541
Uh?

211
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,500
[TIEN grunting]

212
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,583
Hey, Mister Tien!
Please don't be dead...

213
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:11,625
[KRILLIN] Hey, uh, Piccolo, if
you've got some killer attack

214
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,375
up your sleeve, feel free
to use it any time now!

215
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,875
[PICCOLO] I wish I did...

216
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,916
C'mon, it's not
entirely hopeless.

217
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,500
We still have
a chance.

218
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,125
This guy's strong,
but he's not too smart.

219
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,916
He might
make a mistake.

220
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,041
Hey! Don't tell me you
guys are still trying

221
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,208
to come up with a plan?
Give it up! Hah!

222
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:30,916
Raah!

223
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,500
[NAPPA shouting]

224
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,708
[shouting continues]

225
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:44,416
Fwaah!

226
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:53,000
[GOHAN whimpering]

227
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,125
Huh?

228
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,125
[TIEN] Chiaotzu...

229
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,958
Tien! Thank goodness,
you're alive!

230
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,458
[CHIAOTZU]
Tien...

231
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,416
Chiaotzu...

232
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:12,250
I'm so sorry...
I wasn't strong enough.

233
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,541
I couldn't save
you. I failed.

234
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,541
[TIEN] No, Chiaotzu...

235
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,875
[TIEN crying]

236
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,083
A-Are you okay?

237
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,166
[GOHAN] Um, Mister Tien?

238
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,416
Please allow me to
introduce my two star pupils...

239
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,875
You... How dare you!

240
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,666
I swear you'll pay
for this, you monster!

241
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,791
[laughing]

242
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,791
Tien, are we
almost there?

243
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:00,000
Yeah... We'll
see Kami soon...

244
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,416
[CHIAOTZU laughing]

245
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm sorry, Tien... You're my
best friend... always.

246
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,125
Chiaotzu!

247
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,458
[NAPPA chuckling]

248
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:32,291
No, Chiaotzu. I'm sorry.
I'm the one who failed you...

249
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,958
I should have protected
you. But I promise...

250
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,041
I'm going to make it up
to you, right now...

251
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:42,791
[TIEN growling]

252
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:47,208
[GOHAN wailing]

253
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,666
I'll be... with you
again soon, Chiaotzu!

254
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,375
There!

255
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:00,666
Raagh!

256
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,416
What? How?

257
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,875
[whimpering]

258
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,833
Wow...
He did it!

259
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,708
Whew! That was
a close one...

260
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:41,958
There's no way!

261
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:44,583
I know...
This is insane!

262
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:48,375
[TIEN grunting]

263
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:52,208
No... I failed
again...

264
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:01,708
[GOHAN whimpering]

265
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,875
Too bad! It probably
would have worked

266
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,458
if Nappa hadn't seen it
coming at the last second!

267
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:13,875
Oh, no... Poor Tien!
He gave everything...

268
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,625
Everything he
had to help us!

269
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:27,416
Goku! Why aren't you
here? We need you! Goku!

270
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:38,541
[VEGETA] Who is this Goku?
Interesting...

271
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,583
Is it...?

272
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,583
[NAPPA laughing]

273
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:46,625
So much for ol' Three-Eyes!
Now then, where were we?

274
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:48,625
[PICCOLO] Krillin, it looks
like we're gonna have to

275
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,291
finish this
on the ground.

276
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,000
He seems to have a greater
advantage in the air.

277
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,083
[KRILLIN] Gotcha.

278
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,250
[NAPPA laughing]

279
00:19:56,333 --> 00:20:00,291
[NAPPA] Fools! It doesn't matter
where you go! I'll crush you!

280
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,708
Hraagh!

281
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,458
Heads up!

282
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,250
[whimpering]

283
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,333
Nappa! Stop
right there!

284
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,791
Rrgh!

285
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,875
[VEGETA] Hold on! I need
to ask them something.

286
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,083
If you say so...
You're the boss!

287
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,875
[VEGETA] I'm curious about this
"Goku" they keep talking about.

288
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,791
Because I'm starting
to think the person

289
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,291
they're referring to
is actually Kakarot!

290
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:27,000
[KRILLIN] Yeah! Whatever you
call him... That's right!

291
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,625
[VEGETA laughing]

292
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,416
[KRILLIN]
What's so funny?

293
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,583
That you two think
Kakarot can beat us!

294
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,416
He couldn't even beat
his brother Raditz,

295
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,625
and Raditz was a weakling
compared to Nappa and myself!

296
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,916
[KRILLIN] Shows how
much you know!

297
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,875
He's way stronger
than he was before!

298
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,291
Just wait! You'll
find your match in Goku.

299
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:49,208
[NAPPA laughing]

300
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,458
This planet's not that big,
so why isn't he here yet?

301
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,166
He's smart! He's not going to
show up here! He's hiding!

302
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,125
Hey, you jerk! My Dad
never ran from anybody!

303
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:02,000
He'll be here, and he'll
beat you! Just you wait!

304
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,416
[VEGETA] You've
caught my interest!

305
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,791
We're going to
wait for him...

306
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,416
Take a break, Nappa.
Cool off for a while.

307
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,583
C'mon, Vegeta!
That's ridiculous!

308
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,416
I was about to
finish 'em off here!

309
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,541
Just hold off for
three hours...

310
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
We'll give
them that.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,458
[NAPPA growling]

312
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,500
Forget it! I
say they die now!

313
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:22,000
Haah!

314
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,791
Nappa! Do you really
want to defy me?!

315
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,791
Rrgh!

316
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:30,750
I-I'm sorry... I guess
I got carried away...

317
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,000
The battle will resume
in three hours,

318
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,166
whether Kakarot
is here or not.

319
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,250
[KRILLIN] Aw, come on, Piccolo.
You can't really blame him.

320
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,666
This is the first time
Gohan's ever been

321
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,416
in an actual battle.
It's scary enough as it is.

322
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,875
Well, I'm more
angry at myself

323
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,791
for counting on him.
What a waste of time!

324
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,625
Just go home,
Gohan.

325
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,791
If you're not going to fight,
you'll only slow us down.

326
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:00,041
[thinking] Not that it
makes much difference.

327
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,708
Judging by the way that
big one takes orders,

328
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,750
the smaller Saiyan
must be even stronger!

329
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:06,500
If that's the case...

330
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:10,625
I'm not even sure if Goku will
be able to stand up to him...

331
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,875
[NAPPA] Please, Vegeta! I was
just starting to have fun!

332
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,875
Now I'm bored!

333
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,916
Calm down...
Use some will power...

334
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,791
There's going to be
a much better show

335
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:25,000
in three hours,
I promise!

336
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:28,416
[VEGETA chuckling]

337
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,958
[NARRATOR] The Saiyans have
granted our heroes

338
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,833
a brief
three-hour reprieve

339
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,791
while they await
Goku's arrival.

340
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,708
But with miles still
left to travel

341
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,333
down the winding
Snake Way,

342
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,666
can Goku make it back to Earth
before the fighting resumes?

343
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,750
Or will his friends
be forced to continue

344
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,375
their losing battle
against the Saiyans alone?

345
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,000
The clock is ticking!

346
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:49,833
And the time for the ultimate
showdown between good and evil

347
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,208
is drawing near...

348
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:55,791
On the next explosive
episode of Dragon Ball Z!
