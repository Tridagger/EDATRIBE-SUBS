1
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:13,000
I'd like to thank everyone
for gathering here.

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,250
All we had to do
was come downstairs.

3
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,750
I kinda figured that
you would've given up by now.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,291
Like I told you already,

5
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,166
we don't need
some know-it-all to tutor us.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,458
If you're so smart,
then prove it to me.

7
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,833
-Prove it to you?
-[FUTARO] Shouldn't be hard.

8
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:29,458
You just have to take this test!

9
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,875
Here's your golden opportunity.

10
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,375
Pass the test, and I swear
I'll never speak to you again.

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,083
[ALL gasp]

12
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:39,541
What? Is he serious?

13
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,083
What test?

14
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,291
I don't even care, so why would
I take your dumb test?

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:46,416
All right, fine. I'll take it.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,041
[NINO]
You can't be serious.

17
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,583
I just need to get
a passing grade.

18
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,208
And then I'll never have
to see your face again.

19
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,291
Aww, yeah! Let's do it!

20
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,625
Sounds pretty easy.

21
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,833
Define "passing grade."

22
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:06,666
Sixty-- no, wait.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,000
I'd say a score of fifty
is adequate.

24
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:10,416
[sighs]

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,791
[NINO]
There's no reason we should have

26
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,791
to prove ourselves to you,

27
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,958
but it's time you learned
not to underestimate us.

28
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,458
[clock ticking]

29
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,333
[FUTARO]
Finished grading your tests!

30
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,666
Wow, you all scored
a hundred points!

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,750
[groans]

32
00:01:35,916 --> 00:01:39,125
-Combined, that is.
-[YOTSUBA chuckles awkwardly]

33
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:40,791
[FUTARO]
This is abysmal.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,583
[NINO] Run for it!
[panting]

35
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:45,875
[YOTSUBA giggles]

36
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,458
This is worse than I thought.

37
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,625
All five of these girls
could flunk out!

38
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,458
[panting]

39
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,583
Damn it.

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,541
I had no idea...

41
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:34,291
tutoring and doing
my own homework...

42
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:38,333
would be this difficult.

43
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,583
-Barely made it.
-[tires screeching]

44
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,791
What the...

45
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,916
That's one swanky limo.

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,541
Bet this is worth
at least a million.

47
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,333
Um, hi? What's your deal?

48
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,666
Stop staring and move aside.

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,041
-[YOTSUBA] Good morning, Futaro!
-You again?

50
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,750
-[ICHIKA] Oh hey, Futaro!
-[MIKU] Mmm.

51
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,125
Stop running! Get back here!

52
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,250
Hey, check it out!

53
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,750
I'm book free now!
Perfectly safe!

54
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,583
-We're not falling for that!
-Don't trust him.

55
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,125
He'll find a way
to teach us something.

56
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,625
Just what kind of person
do you think I am?

57
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,541
[ITSUKI] I'll admit that
each of us has shortcomings.

58
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,041
But we can manage just fine
without any help from you.

59
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,750
We don't need a chaperone
while we study.

60
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,250
What she said.

61
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,875
[FUTARO]
I see.

62
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,625
Then I can assume you reviewed
the test by yourselves.

63
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,500
[ALL chuckle awkwardly]

64
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,083
Question one:

65
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,416
Name the warlord
defeated by Mori Motonari

66
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,166
at the Battle of Itsukushima.

67
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,208
[ITSUKI chuckles]

68
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,541
No answer?

69
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,500
-It's no mystery.
-[GIRLS chattering]

70
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,958
[FUTARO]
These five girls abhor studying.

71
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:03,875
But... it seems they hate me
just as much.

72
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:09,208
I need to find a way to earn
their trust individually.

73
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,125
Huh? Wait a minute.

74
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:14,166
Miku answered
that question right.

75
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,958
So then, why...

76
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,125
Miku?

77
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,625
[STUDENTS chattering]

78
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,041
[WOMAN] One barbecue beef combo,
hold the-- Uh!

79
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,916
-[FUTARO] Hey, Miku.
-Hmm?

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,208
[chuckles awkwardly]

81
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,916
What you eatin' for lunch?

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,291
Um, let's see here,
you have a sandwich

83
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,375
for 350 yen, and, uh...

84
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,333
What kind of drink is that?

85
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,000
[MIKU]
Matcha Soda.

86
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,750
[FUTARO] Matcha?
Hmm, interesting.

87
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,666
I'm curious what
that flavor tastes like.

88
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,916
Well, I would let you
try some of mine,

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,500
but you're a mean person.

90
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,208
Can I at least
ask you something?

91
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,916
About that test question...

92
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,625
[YOTSUBA]
Hey, Mr. Tutor!

93
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,166
Ah! Yotsuba!

94
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,916
Sorry we all ran away
this morning.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,291
It's nothing personal!

96
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,625
Eh, so, Miku--

97
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,916
Get a load of this!
My English homework!

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,083
I got every
single question wrong!

99
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,666
Come on. Let's give 'em
some privacy.

100
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,166
How come?

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,291
I was just gonna
ask him to help me.

102
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,333
You should, too.

103
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,208
Yeah.
That's a hard pass.

104
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,333
I mean, why bother?
We're all dumb.

105
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,500
[FUTARO]
All the more reason to study.

106
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,000
Studying sucks!

107
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,833
Do you really want to waste
your high school years

108
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,875
with your nose
stuck in a book?

109
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,750
We should be out there
enjoying our youth!

110
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,333
Falling in love!

111
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,666
[FUTARO]
Love.

112
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,333
There's no bigger waste of time

113
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:51,708
than ignoring scholastic
endeavors for romance.

114
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,833
Go ahead and fall in love
if you want.

115
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,666
You'll end up like
all the other fools in the world

116
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,916
who peak in high school

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,333
and do nothing else
with their lives.

118
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,750
That really struck a chord.
What's that about?

119
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not into anyone right now,
even if I wanted to date.

120
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,458
What about you, Miku?
Do you have a crush on anyone?

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,583
Ew. No way.

122
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,708
That was a weird reaction.

123
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,375
The look on her face.

124
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,791
As her sister, I know
what that look means!

125
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,041
No freaking way!

00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,875

Huh?

00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,125
Miku is in love?

129
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,583
I need to get these girls
studying one way or another.

130
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,625
Huh?

131
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,666

From Miku?

Hold on!

A love letter?
Miku's in love with me?

137
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,125
But we just met three days ago!

138
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,750
Okay, what's that look
on your face about?

139
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,625
I swear, you're so creepy.

Miku's pranking me.
Be cool, you got this.

You don't need to put up
with this nonsense,

143
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,750
and you don't need
to go to the roof.

Nuh-uh!

00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:17,583

I knew it was a juvenile prank
from the very beginning.

that she'd...

Hi. I'm glad you came.

I actually wanted to tell you
back in the cafeteria.

anybody hearing me.
