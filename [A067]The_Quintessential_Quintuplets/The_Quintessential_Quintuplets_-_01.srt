00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:18,483
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,650
[FUTARO]
I was having a dream...

3
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,150
[WOMAN]
Please wake up now, sir.

4
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:27,150
Your bride is ready
and waiting for you.

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:29,900
[FUTARO groans]

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,150
[FUTARO]
A dream about

7
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:34,150
the incredible day
that brought us together.

8
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,567
One barbecue combo.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,150
And hold the barbecue.

10
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:42,400
[LUNCH LADY]
Comin' up.

11
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:43,775
[FUTARO]
You'd think the cheapest thing

12
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,983
on the cafeteria menu
would be rice, but it's not.

13
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,150
You save 200 yen if you skip
the beef in the combo.

14
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:54,358
It's rice, soup, and veggies
for the same cost as just rice.

15
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,067
[FUTARO]
And the water's free!

16
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,817
I love this place.

17
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,942
Eating alone, as always. Heh.

18
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,317
That loser!

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,025
[FUTARO]
Hmph.

20
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,275
Uh.

21
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:12,858
Huh?

22
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:14,150
[gasps]

23
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:51,358
[STUDENT A]
Hey, who's that girl?

24
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,025
[STUDENT AA]
She's sitting with Uesugi?

25
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:54,317
[STUDENT B]
No one does that!

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,108
[FUTARO]
That's not our uniform.

27
00:02:57,192 --> 00:03:00,900
Wait, how did this happen?

28
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:03,108
[ITSUKI] I found this
spot before you did.

29
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,067
The next table is wide open.

30
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,567
I think you should move.

31
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,400
This is the table
that I sit at every day!

32
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,400
Why don't you move?

33
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:11,817
[ITSUKI gasps]

34
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,983
[STUDENT BB] Look, Uesugi's
eating lunch with a girl!

35
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,275
Is she stupid?

36
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,983
Tch. Seriously?

37
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,358
[FUTARO]
She's all red.

38
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,900
You could've switched seats.

39
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:29,817
[FUTARO gasps]

40
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,400
[FUTARO]
250 for udon.

41
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,692
Two shrimp tempura
would be 300.

42
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:36,192
The other varieties of tempura
cost a 100 yen each.

43
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,817
Add the pudding and that's--

44
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,025
Who just drops a
thousand yen on lunch?!

45
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,525
Well, you do you.

46
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:48,233
Time to eat.

47
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,275
Uh?

48
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,025
[ITSUKI] That's a little rude,
don't you think?

49
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,358
You're studying
in the middle of lunch?

50
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,942
I'm reviewing my exam.
Leave me alone, jeez.

51
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:07,858
Wow, you must have gotten
a pretty rotten grade, huh?

52
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:09,442
Can I take a look?

53
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:10,733
Ah! Hey!

54
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,942
Let's see, Mr. Futaro Uesugi.
You scored a--

55
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,400
[gasps]

56
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,442
[ITSUKI]
A... hundred?

57
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:20,442
Is this real?

58
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:23,233
Oh, no! I'm so embarrassed!

59
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:25,608
You wanted me to see it!

60
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,983
[ITSUKI] I hate to admit it, but
I'm not good at school stuff.

61
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,442
I envy you.

62
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:36,150
You know, it must've been fate
that brought us together!

63
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,025
Do you wanna help me study?

64
00:04:38,108 --> 00:04:39,608
Well, this has been great.

65
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,983
Uh! You're already done?

66
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,358
You didn't eat much.
Are you sure you got enough?

67
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,442
If you want more,
I'd be happy to share mine.

68
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,942
If anything, you ordered
way too much food.

69
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,275
Don't get fat.

70
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,817
What the--?!

71
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,692
I think you might be
the most insensitive person

72
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:00,275
--I've met in my entire life!
--[phone ringing]

73
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,525
I'm not sharing
anything with you!

74
00:05:04,858 --> 00:05:07,067
[FUTARO]
A chance to pay off our debt?

75
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,608
[RAIHA] Yeah, Dad found
a part-time job for you.

76
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:12,400
A super-rich family
just moved here.

77
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:15,858
They're looking to hire a tutor.
What do you think?

78
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:17,317
[FUTARO]
A tutor, huh?

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,858
You would get to work
in a nice fancy house.

80
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:22,608
And it pays five times
the going rate.

81
00:05:22,692 --> 00:05:24,442
[FUTARO]
That sounds like a sketchy deal

82
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,650
if I'm being honest.

83
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,525
Well, selling a kidney
is sketchy, too,

84
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,317
but you only need one to live.

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,525
Whoa, what are you suggesting?

86
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:31,733
[RAIHA laughs]

87
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,567
[RAIHA]
It's a joke.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,942
But if you do do it,

89
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,692
then you'll be able to afford
some actual meals.

90
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:39,858
It's worth a try.

91
00:05:39,942 --> 00:05:42,692
[stomach growls]

92
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,233
[FUTARO] So, do we know anything
about who I'm tutoring?

93
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,567
[RAIHA]
Hmm... High school age?

94
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,108
In fact, I'm pretty sure he said
you were gonna be classmates.

95
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,733
What was the name? Nakano?

96
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,108
Itsuki Nakano.

97
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,483
It's so nice to meet all of you.

98
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,150
[gasps]

99
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,983
[FUTARO]
This chick again?!

100
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,400
--A new girl!
--[STUDENT C] And she's cute!

101
00:06:05,483 --> 00:06:07,608
Hey, that's the Kurobara
uniform, isn't it?

102
00:06:07,692 --> 00:06:09,608
[STUDENT D]
Her folks must be loaded!

103
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:13,150
[FUTARO]
A rich transfer student?

104
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,692
Obviously, it's her.

105
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,942
Uh... Hey...

106
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,108
[ITSUKI]
Hmph.

107
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,775
You mind if I sit here?

108
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:25,942
[FUTARO]
Great... Just great.

109
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,400
[LUNCH LADY]
Here's that barbecue beef combo,

110
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,858
hold the beef.

111
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:32,442
[FUTURO]
Yesterday didn't go too well.

112
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,442
But if she rejects me again,

113
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:38,108
then I'll lose the job
of a lifetime!

114
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:41,025
I have to get back
on her good side.

115
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,567
[FUTARO]
Hello again.

116
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,483
Could I have the honor
of dining with you today?

117
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,525
And of course, I'd be happy
to help with your studies.

118
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:51,233
[ITSUKI]
Wow!

119
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,275
[FUTARO]
It's foolproof!

120
00:06:53,358 --> 00:06:54,275
[gasps]

121
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:55,858
Hey, sorry I'm late.

122
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:57,775
[FUTARO]
She's eating with... friends?!

123
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,733
[ITSUKI gasps]

124
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:03,275
Oops, it looks like we don't
have any room left for you.

125
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:05,983
[FUTARO]
Mm-hmm...

126
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:14,025
[ICHIKA]
Hey, wait! Don't just leave!

127
00:07:14,108 --> 00:07:15,483
Huh?

128
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,317
[ICHIKA] You're after Itsuki,
aren't you? Hmm?

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,858
Uh, I'm not after her.

130
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:23,192
Oh? So she is
the one that you like!

131
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,400
[ICHIKA giggles]

132
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,692
So what is it about her
you're attracted to?

133
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:29,775
Let me guess:
It's her serious side!

134
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:32,400
I know! I'll go tell
her to come over!

135
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,317
[FUTARO]
No.

136
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,233
[gasps]

137
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:37,233
I don't need anyone's help.

138
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:41,025
My problems are mine
alone to solve.

139
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:41,733
[ICHIKA giggles]

140
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:43,692
Wow, that was so manly!

141
00:07:43,775 --> 00:07:45,358
You know, for a nerd.

142
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,775
But if you ever do need help,

143
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:49,317
you can just ask
your Big Sis Ichika.

144
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,025
This is gonna be fun.

145
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,067
Hold on, "Big Sis"?

146
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,233
We're the same year, aren't we?

147
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,817
[FUTARO]
This is no good.

148
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,483
I'm supposed to meet
that bratty girl

149
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,983
as her tutor today after school.

150
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,983
--[YOTSUBA] Uesugi? 'Scuse me?
--[FUTARO] What now?

151
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:08,025
[YOTSUBA]
Hey, Uesugi!

152
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,233
[giggles]

153
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:11,525
You finally looked up.

154
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,567
[FUTARO]
Whoa! Who the heck are you?

155
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,025
And how do you know
what my name is?

156
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:19,525
[YOTSUBA laughs]

157
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,108
[YOTSUB] Those are both
excellent questions!

158
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,983
Did you lose an exam paper
with a perfect score?

159
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,525
Or perhaps one
with a zero score?

160
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,942
You have my exam? But how?

161
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:33,608
Well, it's a long story.

162
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:34,942
[YOTSUBA]
Earlier...

163
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,858
...that happened.

164
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:39,067
And then, I noticed it.

165
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,067
And now, here we are!

166
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,775
So, which one is yours?

167
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,650
[FUTARO]
This one.

168
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,942
Wow! You're such an honest guy!

169
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:50,317
I'll give you both as a reward!

170
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,067
[FUTARO]
That's okay.

171
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,108
What idiot got a zero?

172
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:55,608
You're lookin' right at her!

173
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:57,817
[FUTARO] And you're not
even embarrassed?!

174
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:01,942
[YOTSUBA] You know,
when I first saw you,

175
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,108
I thought you were nothin'
but a grumpy, boring old loner.

176
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:08,192
Now I know that you're all that
and a super-genius!

177
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,233
That was quick!

178
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:12,525
[BOYS]
Uh...

179
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:16,442
[grunting]

180
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,233
Are you still following me?!

181
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,650
Well, yeah, you haven't
said "thank you" yet.

182
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:21,858
What?!

183
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:22,983
[YOTSUBA] When someone
picks up your stuff,

184
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,650
you thank them.

185
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,400
You'd think a super-genius
would know something like that.

186
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,400
[FUTARO]
Here, I picked this up for you.

187
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:32,942
Now, we're even.

188
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:37,192
Yeah! Thanks so much
for your help!

189
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,317
[FUTARO]
Don't thank me for that!

190
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:43,817
[FUTARO]
I don't know why I thought

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,275
she'd walk home by herself.

192
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,983
[NINO]
Itsuki, aren't you eating a lot?

193
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,442
It's not that much.

194
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,733
This is only my second one.

195
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,275
[NINO]
Look out, it's the bun monster!

196
00:09:55,358 --> 00:09:57,900
Ah! Hey, get off of my case!

197
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,608
[NINO] You're gonna
scare the boys away!

198
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,608
[ITSUKI]
Mind your own business!

199
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,775
When am I gonna apologize?

200
00:10:03,858 --> 00:10:05,983
[MIKU]
Is it fun being alone?

201
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,483
Uh...

202
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:11,858
Uh, it's not bad.
This is my hobby.

203
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:12,942
[MIKU]
I see.

204
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,150
Staring at girls
is your hobby, huh?

205
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:17,900
Just a second.

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,150
Please don't
call the cops on me.

207
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,692
And please don't tell
your friend Itsuki about this.

208
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,442
Fine, I won't.

209
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:28,400
Also, that girl is
in no way my friend.

210
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:29,608
[FUTARO]
Huh?

211
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:34,567
[groans]

212
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,942
[FUTARO]
She lives here?

213
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,275
How rich can one person be?

214
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:43,483
But this is it.
At least, I think it is.

215
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:47,692
[crashing]

216
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:48,900
[grunts]

217
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:50,608
[NINO] What are you,
some kind of stalker?

218
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,733
State your name and
business, or get lost.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,608
My business has nothing
to do with you.

220
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,942
I'll decide that.

221
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,317
Listen, nobody likes you.

222
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,025
So go home already, scum!

223
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,608
[FUTARO]
I'd love to.

224
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,233
But this building is my home.

225
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,025
[ITSUKI]
Uh, really? I'm sorry!

226
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:14,400
One barbecue beef combo,
hold the barbecue.

227
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:15,275
Huh?!

228
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,608
[MIKU]
Are you on a diet?

229
00:11:16,692 --> 00:11:17,817
Huh?

230
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,817
Uh! Hey, you!

231
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,025
I knew it!

232
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:25,358
[FUTARO]
Found her!

233
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:28,108
This is my last
chance to fix it!

234
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:30,942
[FUTARO grunts]

235
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,275
[FUTARo]
Please don't close!

236
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,192
[FUTARO groans]

237
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:42,983
[yelling]

238
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,108
[FUTARO]
This whole thing is her fault!

239
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:47,775
I shouldn't have to apologize
for any of this crap!

240
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,942
It's her fault that I'm tired
and sweaty from running.

241
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:55,025
It's her fault that those
weirdos keep harassing me.

242
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,608
It's all...

243
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,108
[gasps]

244
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:04,483
[FUTARO]
...it's all her... fault.

245
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,567
Hey, you're that guy
from school.

246
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,733
What could be so important

247
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,317
that you would follow me
all the way home?

248
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
[FUTARO]
About yesterday...

249
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,983
Huh? Yesterday?

250
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,150
What are you even
doing here, anyway?

251
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:21,025
I told you. You see, I-I was--

252
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,608
Never mind, I don't care.

253
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,275
Wait, listen to me!

254
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:27,025
No, you listen! You're starting
to get on my nerves!

255
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:28,733
I have a meeting with my
tutor in a few minutes,

256
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:30,275
so if could you
please leave alre--

257
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,108
That'd be me.

258
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,025
What?!

259
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:37,733
[FUTARO]
Your new tutor. It's me.

260
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:39,233
Gah!

261
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:42,233
[ITSUKI gasps]

262
00:12:42,317 --> 00:12:44,233
No way, I refuse!

263
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:45,858
[FUTARO]
I hate it, too!

264
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,775
Much more than you do!

265
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:51,108
But... I'm still
not gonna give up.

266
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:56,067
Yesterday, I was totally in
the wrong, and I'm sorry.

267
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,442
But that changes now!

268
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:02,400
Starting today...
I'm your partner!

269
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,775
[ITSUKI]
This can't be right.

270
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:06,733
It's not fair!

271
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:10,483
Why does our tutor have
to be you, of all people?

272
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:12,650
[FUTARO]
Did you say "our"?

273
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,442
[ICHIKA] I can't believe
there was a creeper

274
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,608
hanging around
outside our condo!

275
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,025
--[YOTSUBA] Whoa!
--[NINO] Scary!

276
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,192
[gasps]

277
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:20,483
Huh?!

278
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,275
Hey there, Mr. Honor Roll!

279
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,358
That's him, he's the stalker!

280
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:28,567
Uesugi's a stalker?!

281
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,233
Don't assume things.

282
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:32,733
[FUTARO]
Why are you all here?!

283
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,358
[ITSUKI sighs]

284
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:39,192
'Cause this is where
we live, obviously.

285
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:41,108
[FUTARO]
Uh...

286
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:45,108
Oh, I see. You share a fancy
condo with all your girlfriends.

287
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,233
[FUTARO] My poor brain,
under heavy duress

288
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,858
and overclocked past
its manufacturer limit,

289
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,525
reached the only
logical conclusion

290
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:53,900
that it could possibly muster.

291
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:57,275
A dream. This is
definitely a dream.

292
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:00,400
[ITSUKI] We're not friends,
we're sisters.

293
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:02,483
[gulps]

294
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,442
In fact, we're quintuplets.

295
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,483
[FUTARO]
My name is Futaro Uesugi,

296
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,525
and I'll be your tutor
starting today.

297
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:12,692
Let's all make studying
fun, and, uh...

298
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,608
What the hell?!

299
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:18,775
Why is nobody in here?!

300
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,817
Hey, hey! Sorry I'm late!

301
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,275
Oh, uh...

302
00:14:23,358 --> 00:14:25,817
You're the one with
the zero. Yotsuba.

303
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,400
[YOTSUBA chuckles nervously]

304
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:31,233
Could you do me a quick
favor and scowl at me?

305
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:33,983
Uh... What, like this?

306
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,858
[FUTARO]
Yup, they're related.

307
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,983
[FUTARO]
So, why are you here?

308
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:42,983
Obviously, it's time to start
our first tutoring session.

309
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,983
Where else would I be?!

310
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:46,692
Thank you, Yotsuba.

311
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,442
Please, let me hug you.

312
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:52,483
Well! Let's go and round up
the other girls, shall we?

313
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,192
All of our bedrooms
are side-by-side, see?

314
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:57,650
Itsuki, me, that one's Miku,

315
00:14:57,733 --> 00:15:00,275
then Nino, and Ichika's
at the end.

316
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,192
Great. This is gonna
be such a pain.

317
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,025
Oh, no, it'll be easy!

318
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:07,233
Itsuki is a real
serious student!

319
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:10,983
She'll cooperate as long as
you don't make her too angry!

320
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:12,525
[ITSUKI]
Not a chance.

321
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,817
What's the point of a tutor
who's in the same class as I am?

322
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,317
There has to be someone
in this city

323
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,608
better qualified
for the position than you are.

324
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:20,733
What gives?

325
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,067
Yesterday, you wanted
me to help you!

326
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,567
Well, I was wrong.

327
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,608
It's not happening.

328
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,733
[YOTSUBA giggles nervously]

329
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,025
With five of us,

330
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,150
there's bound to be
at least one disagreement.

331
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:33,317
Miku's the smartest one here.

332
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,608
She'll come down.

333
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:38,692
I'm sure you'll get
along fine with her.

334
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,108
No.

335
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,650
Honestly, why does
it have to be you?

336
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,567
There has to be someone
in this city better--

337
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,483
[FUTARO]
Yup, I've heard that already.

338
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:51,775
Um, maybe we should move on?

339
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,983
Nino can hit it off with
anybody, so you'll be fine!

340
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,692
She's like a social butterfly!

341
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:01,608
Uh, but I guess
she stepped out?

342
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:03,650
Uh, you don't need
to worry, though!

343
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,692
We still gotta go see Ichika!

344
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:07,567
She's really...

345
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,733
Uh...

346
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:11,775
[FUTARO]
What's with the pause?

347
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,817
[YOTSUBA]
Don't freak out, okay?

348
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,192
[FUTARO gasps]

349
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:19,900
It's like some kind
of disaster area!

350
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:22,567
An actual human lives in here?

351
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,775
[ICHIKA]
Stop talking about my room

352
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:29,400
like it's this disgusting
wasteland full of toxic sludge.

353
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,233
[YOTSUBA]
Ugh, this place is a wreck!

354
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:35,567
[ICHIKA]
Wow, I wasn't expecting you

355
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,775
to be our mysterious new tutor.

356
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,650
That's why you
were after Itsuki.

357
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,275
Forget that. Come on,
let's go downstairs.

358
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:44,275
Whoa! That's a bad idea!

359
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:45,483
[gasps]

360
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,942
[ICHIKA giggles]

361
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,150
[ICHIKA]
I'm kinda naked here.

362
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:51,025
[FUTARO]
Wha--? But why?

363
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,483
[ICHIKA]
Yotsuba?

364
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,942
There should be some clothes
near your feet somewhere.

365
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,525
[YOTSUBA]
Uh, let's see.

366
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,983
[FUTARO]
Good grief.

367
00:16:59,067 --> 00:17:01,358
When was the last time you
used this desk for studying?

368
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:04,150
[ICHIKA] Ugh! Studying
this, studying that.

369
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,525
I hope you're not always this
concerned about your schoolwork

370
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,858
when you're in a bedroom
with a cute, naked girl.

371
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,525
--[FUTARO] Ugh...
--Here we go!

372
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:14,567
Just get dressed and come to the
living room when you're done.

373
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,233
Honestly...

374
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,650
What was your name again?
Futaro? I have a question.

375
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,233
[FUTARO]
Huh?

376
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:27,025
It seems I'm missing
part of my P.E. uniform.

377
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,233
A red track jacket.

378
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:32,525
That's too bad.
I haven't seen it.

379
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,817
[MIKU]
It was here before.

380
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,150
Right up until you came in.

381
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:40,358
Did you--?

382
00:17:40,442 --> 00:17:41,275
No!

383
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:42,775
[NINO]
Hey!

384
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:46,150
I made way too many
cookies. Want some?

385
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,900
[FUTARO] Good, at least
I've got four of you here.

386
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,150
Well! Time to hit the--

387
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,733
[ICHICKA]
Ooh, yum!

388
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:55,900
What flavor is this?

389
00:17:55,983 --> 00:17:57,942
[MIKU] Why are you wearing
my track jacket?

390
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:00,775
[NINO] I was baking and I didn't
wanna get my outfit dirty.

391
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,275
Take it off right now.

392
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:04,067
[NINO]
Hey, let go of me!

393
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,233
[MIKU]
Give it back!

394
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,400
[NINO] You can have it
later, calm down!

395
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,733
[YOTSUBA]
Uesugi!

396
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:13,608
Don't worry about me!
I'm already studying hard!

397
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,942
[FUTARO groans]

398
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,150
[NINO] It's Saturday, we should
go somewhere fun!

399
00:18:17,233 --> 00:18:18,442
Oh, did I get a package?

400
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,150
[FUTARO]
They're hopeless!

401
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,817
What am I supposed
to do with them?!

402
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,025
[NINO]
You don't like cookies?

403
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:28,525
Uh? No, I'm just
not in the mood.

404
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,317
You don't have
to be so nervous.

405
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,442
It's not like
I poisoned them, you know.

406
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:35,942
Have some and I'll study with
you, does that sound good?

407
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:37,775
[FUTARO grunts]

408
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,608
[NINO] Wow! You're really
scarfing them down!

409
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:45,483
You like them?

410
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,233
Yeah! They're awesome!

411
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:50,442
Aw, thanks!

412
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,525
Oh, there's something
I meant to tell you!

413
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:57,275
None of us need a tutor,
so you should probably go away.

414
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,817
[MIKU]
Uh.

415
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,733
I was just kidding!

416
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:06,150
Here, have some water.

417
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:08,317
Uh, good idea, thank you.

418
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,775
[FUTARO] Damn. I'm not surprised
that they're slacking off.

419
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:14,775
But they need to graduate!

420
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:17,983
For their sake... and mine.

421
00:19:19,983 --> 00:19:22,067
Well, goodbye!

422
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,400
Huh?

423
00:19:25,858 --> 00:19:29,608
[DRIVER] Sir? Pardon me,
but we've arrived, sir.

424
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:30,608
[groans]

425
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,483
Huh?

426
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,567
Huh?!

427
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,067
Wait, where--?

428
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,400
What's wrong?

429
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:38,233
This is your home, isn't it?

430
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:41,483
[FUTARO]
Well, it is, but how did I..."

431
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,358
--[NINO giggles]
--[FUTARO gasps]

432
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:43,483
[FUTARO]
It was her!

433
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:45,400
[DRIVER]
4800 yen, please.

434
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,483
Uh! That much?!

435
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:48,983
I don't have it!

436
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,317
[ITSUKI]
Here you go.

437
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,025
[DRIVER]
Ah. Thank you, miss.

438
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,442
[FUTARO gasps]

439
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,900
[FUTARO]
Itsuki!

440
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,900
[ITSUKI] I got your address
from your student handbook.

441
00:19:59,983 --> 00:20:01,567
[FUTARO]
Uh... Uh?

442
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,400
Did you look at the photo?

443
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,275
[ITSUKI]
What're you talking about?

444
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,858
Anyway, you can't
win against us.

445
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,358
You're a smart guy,

446
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,650
so I hope you're bright enough
to give up on tutoring us.

447
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,858
Sorry, but I can't.

448
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:15,692
[ITSUKI gasps]

449
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:16,525
Don't be stubborn!

450
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:17,608
[RAIHA giggles]

451
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,150
[RAIHA]
You're back, Big Brother!

452
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,442
Hey, Raiha.

453
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:24,358
I'm so glad you're home!
Let's eat dinner!

454
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:25,525
Huh?

455
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:26,983
Wow!

456
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:29,567
Wow, is she your new student?

457
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,108
[FUTARO]
Uh, she's nobody.

458
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:32,483
Just go back inside.

459
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,400
[RAIHA]
Don't lie to me!

460
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,733
Excuse me, miss!

461
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,858
Would you like to have
dinner at our house?

462
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:38,733
[ITSUKI gasps]

463
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,067
[FUTARO]
Raiha!

464
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,608
What'd I do?

465
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:45,400
You don't... want to?

466
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:46,942
[gasps]

467
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,733
[RAIHA]
Ta-da!

468
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:53,775
It’s the Uesugi special:
Curry and rolled egg!

469
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,025
I hope everything
turned out okay!

470
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:57,400
[ITSUKI]
It looks delicious!

471
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:59,275
Ahhh!

472
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,942
Sure you can stomach this
commoner food, princess?

473
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:03,817
[ITSUKI grunbles]

474
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,983
[FUTARO yelps]

475
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,275
--Hey!
--[RAIHA] Jeez!

476
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,858
[ISANARI laughs]

477
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,692
And that's why you'll never be
as popular as your old man is.

478
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:12,025
[FUTARO]
Dad.

479
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,275
[ISANARI]
I gotta say, I didn't think

480
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:15,192
I'd live to see the day
you brought a girl home!

481
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,733
So, Big Brother?

482
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,942
[FUTARO]
Huh?

483
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,858
[RAIHA] How was
your first day of tutoring?

484
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,400
[BOTH gasp]

485
00:21:22,442 --> 00:21:23,567
Well, actually, he--

486
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,025
Of course everything
went perfectly!

487
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:27,150
Why'd you say that?

488
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,483
Just lie. Don't make her sad.

489
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:30,442
What's wrong?

490
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,025
[FUTARO]
Huh?! Nothing!

491
00:21:32,108 --> 00:21:34,108
[ITSUKI]
Yeah! Everything's great!

492
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,233
Ah... I'm so happy to hear that.

493
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:39,192
Maybe now we can finally
take care of all our debt.

494
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,067
[FUTARO] Not in front
of the guest, Raiha.

495
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,025
[RAIHA]
Oh, sorry.

496
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,483
[ITSUKI]
Thanks for the meal.

497
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,358
[ISANARI]
Sure.

498
00:21:46,442 --> 00:21:50,400
You, too. It was lovely. Huh?

499
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,608
[RAIHA]
Itsuki?

500
00:21:51,692 --> 00:21:53,025
[ITSUKI]
Yes?

501
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:55,900
I know my big brother's
a stuck-up scumbag loser jerk

502
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:56,775
and everything...

503
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,650
Uh, hey...

504
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,483
[RAIHA]
...but he's good in some ways.

505
00:22:00,567 --> 00:22:01,608
[gasps]

506
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:03,567
What I wanna say is...

507
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,108
...will you come here
again sometime?

508
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,525
[chuckles]

509
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:10,525
[ITSUKI]
Of course I will!

510
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:12,942
Using my brain
makes me super hungry!

511
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,483
I'm looking forward
to the next time!

512
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:19,150
[ITSUKI]
Don't get the wrong idea.

513
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,650
I may know what
your situation is like now,

514
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:23,567
but I still can't help you.

515
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,650
[FUTARO]
Is that so?

516
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,650
I'll study hard whether
you tutor me or not.

517
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,608
I can accomplish my goals
with or without you.

518
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,108
It's your choice.

519
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:38,483
So if you want to be our tutor,
then you can go right ahead.

520
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,775
[gasps]

521
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,817
What did you say?

522
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,275
What? I just said
it's your choice.

523
00:22:44,358 --> 00:22:46,192
Wow, you really mean that?

524
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,775
I can keep the job?!
Thank you, Itsuki!

525
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:51,525
Uh, sure?

526
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,817
[FUTARO] I'll be there
tomorrow at noon sharp!

527
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,858
Tell your sisters to be ready!

528
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,858
[ITSUKI]
Uh-huh.

529
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,317
[FUTARO]
That's right,

530
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,233
my only job is to make sure
the five of them graduate.

531
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,942
That doesn't mean I actually
have to deal with all five

532
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:07,525
and their annoyink

533
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:12,442
I just need to teach the ones
who are at risk of failing.

534
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,608
Do you think Futaro knows?

535
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,525
I highly doubt he does.

536
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,192
[ICHIKA] It's not like anybody
would've told him

537
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:20,400
that we transferred here

538
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,233
because all five of us
almost flunked out.

539
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:28,983
[bells ringing]

540
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,567
Yeah, you're right.

541
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:41,442
[FUTARO]
All these years later,

542
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:45,192
I still relive that moment
in my dreams.

543
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,567
[FUTARO]
Or should I say...

544
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,442
...my nightmares...

545
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,525
[ITSUKI]
Quintuplets Trivia!

546
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,525
[NINO] Altogether, we weigh
about 250 kilograms!

547
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:08,358
[ITSUKI] Hey, that divides
evenly by five!

548
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:09,650
50 kilos each,

549
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,442
the average weight
for a healthy young girl!

550
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,608
Let's leave it at that!

551
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:13,525
[YOTSUBA]
Uh, but--

552
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,025
[ITSUKI]
I said leave it at that!

553
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:16,317
[MIKU, YOTSUBA]
Fine.
