1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,607
That's kind of
ridiculously overdone.

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,742
Jibril:
<i>Why would they ever need</i>
<i>to build something</i>

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,276
<i>so absurdly huge?</i>

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,878
<i>They couldn't possibly</i>
<i>be trying to compensate</i>

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,246
<i>for something,</i>
<i>could they?</i>

6
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,949
Okay, well, this was
a nice little vacation

7
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,251
but could you please take me
far away from this place now?

8
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,486
<i>Hey, wait, this embassy's</i>
<i>on foreign soil.</i>

9
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:23,557
Sora:
Yeah, yeah, but it was
originally our castle,

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,157
too, you know.

11
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,692
Steph:
But this is an invasion
of their territory.

12
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,762
Just relax, I made
an appointment already.

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,329
Hey there!

14
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,132
Greetings, Lord Sora
and Lady Shiro.

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,534
Welcome to our embassy.

16
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,137
I'm the assistant ambassador
to the Elkian embassy,

17
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,605
Ino Hatsuse.

18
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,206
A pleasure to meet you.

19
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,642
Wait, when did‐

20
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,543
This morning.

21
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>I could see the old dude</i>
<i>checking me out in the library,</i>

22
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,347
<i>so I signaled to him</i>
<i>I'd come over.</i>

23
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,950
<i>Man, just like they say,</i>
<i>those Warbeast senses</i>

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,384
<i>really are awesome.</i>

25
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,453
<i>It's like they've got</i>
<i>telescopic vision.</i>

26
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,388
You could've told me
about this, you know.

27
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,358
Undoubtedly the reason
for your visit is to meet

28
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,126
with Ambassador Izuna Hatsuse.

29
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,695
Is that correct?

30
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,798
Steph:
<i>It looks like the</i>
<i>rumors really were true.</i>

31
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,568
<i>The Warbeasts can</i>
<i>read people's minds.</i>

32
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,070
Glad to hear we're all
on the same page.

33
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,205
Right, let's get moving.

34
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,174
Very well.

35
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,442
This way, if you please.

36
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,813
Steph:
<i>Forget about the Warbeasts.</i>

37
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:24,050
<i>How did Sora see him</i>
<i>from way over there?</i>

38
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,720
Sora:
<i>In case you hadn't noticed...</i>

39
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,154
Sora:
Uh...

40
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,091
The game...

41
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,160
it's already begun,
hasn't it?

42
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,935
Sora:
<i>Hey, Jibril?</i>

43
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,036
Jibril:
<i>Yes?</i>

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,605
Sora:
What do you guys
call this?

45
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,207
Jibril:
It's an image
display device.

46
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,309
But wait, the Warbeasts
can't use magic,

47
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,777
so I don't know
how they're doing it.

48
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,847
My, but it is rather
fascinating! (giggles)

49
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,517
Cool.

50
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,186
( screams ) What's going on?
Why have the floor moving?

51
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,189
Pardon, but I beg you
follow proper procedures

52
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,592
when making an
appointment next time.

53
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,794
Due to an incident,
many Warbeasts

54
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,697
<i>harbor extreme animosity</i>
<i>toward Elkia.</i>

55
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,600
<i>Since you arrived so quickly,</i>
<i>most weren't informed</i>

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>and may not act</i>
<i>entirely... civil.</i>

57
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,904
Well, that makes sense,
I mean, a dog

58
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,574
that talks and walks
is still just a dog, right?

59
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:03,243
Hey, Steph, what incident?

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,679
Yeah, he's referring
to the Construction Wars.

61
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,748
<i>Having a foreign embassy</i>
<i>bigger than our palace</i>

62
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,482
<i>was really bad for our image,</i>

63
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:11,484
<i>so we ended up building</i>
<i>a new bigger one.</i>

64
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,954
Sora:
<i>That's the one</i>
<i>we live in now, right?</i>

65
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,255
Steph:
<i>No, 'cause after that,</i>

66
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,591
<i>the Eastern Federation built</i>
<i>their embassy even bigger,</i>

67
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,793
<i>so we had to keep competing.</i>

68
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,428
But when it comes
to construction technology,

69
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,065
Elkia lags way behind
the Eastern Federation, so‐

70
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:25,832
Isn't that ironic?

71
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,735
If I recall, the Warbeasts
are only ranked 14 themselves,

72
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,737
so looking down
on Imanity is... well,

73
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,338
I'm not sure how
your people say it,

74
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,408
but we say it's like a moron
laughing at an imbecile.

75
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,378
( laughs )
That may be true in a sense,

76
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,981
but it seems a bit petty
coming from someone

77
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,148
from the sixth order.

78
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,552
Speaking of which, as a weapon,
I fear you're defective

79
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:48,154
if you're serving
a bunch of shaved monkeys.

80
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,157
Sora:
Okay, guess relations in this
world are pretty strained, huh?

81
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,127
Steph:
The war dragged on forever,
and thanks to the ten pledges,

82
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,462
they can't get violent,
so they ended up letting out

83
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,965
their aggression
this way instead.

84
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,233
(elevator dings)

85
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,804
( laughter and groaning )

86
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,774
Ino:
<i>( clears throat )</i>
<i>My lords, please wait here.</i>

87
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:17,618
Steph:
<i>Each culture certainly</i>
<i>has its own style, huh?</i>

88
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,654
Master,
you never told us

89
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,656
how you make contact
with the Warbeasts.

90
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,458
Nobody's talking about it,
so just take the hint, okay?

91
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,894
I apologize for
prying, master.

92
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,564
But I can't read minds
like the beasts here

93
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,098
and I really,
really want to know.

94
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,768
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell
me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

95
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,038
Both: Hmm?

96
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,340
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>So even with your</i>
<i>little magic rectangle,</i>

97
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,708
<i>you still couldn't</i>
<i>see him clearly,</i>

98
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,610
<i>but you guessed</i>
<i>that he saw you</i>

99
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,847
<i>and gestured to him</i>
<i>accordingly, is that right?</i>

100
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,716
Steph:
Don't tell me you bluffed
someone who can read minds.

101
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,552
Ino:
<i>I apologize for the wait.</i>

102
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,787
<i>Presenting the</i>
<i>Eastern Federation's</i>

103
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,558
<i>ambassador to Elkia,</i>
<i>Miss Izuna Hatsuse.</i>

104
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,560
Sora and Shiro:
<i>Erase time!</i>

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,628
Pretty girl with animal ears,
want to come play with me?

106
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:04,898
I'm a little bit of a perv,
but I've got a clean record.

107
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,699
( panting laugh )

108
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,369
Why the hell are you assholes
touching me, please?

109
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,937
( stammers )

110
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:11,738
What?!

111
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,307
Minus 50 cuteness points
for sure.

112
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,577
Who said you shitheads
could stop? Thank you.

113
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:20,046
You popped out of nowhere
and surprised me is all, please.

114
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,949
Commence the petting,
peasants, thank you.

115
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,553
Both:
Uh...

116
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,655
Adding "please" and "thank you"
at the end of a sentence

117
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,991
doesn't automatically
make it polite, you know.

118
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,793
Of course it does,
you idiot, thanks.

119
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,361
I apologize
if she has offended you.

120
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,299
My granddaughter's still getting
a grasp of the Imanity language.

121
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,433
Oh, and by the way...

122
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,670
KEEP YOUR FILTHY MONKEY PAWS
OFF OF HER,

123
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,640
you hairless primates,
or I'll rip you a new asshole!

124
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,810
Or that's what I would say
if you weren't so charming.

125
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,012
So I guess she gets it
from the old fart, huh?

126
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,815
He's a bad accessory.
Minus 1,000 points.

127
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:57,951
But I just love her
conflicting personalities.

128
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,152
Plus 1,050 points.

129
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,655
You hairless monkeys do that
way better than grandpa.

130
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,056
( roars )
Please, keep going. Thank you.

131
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,959
Look, why don't we give
the whole monkeys thing a rest?

132
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,629
I'm Sora. That's my
little sister Shiro.

133
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,597
Nice to meet
you, Izuna.

134
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,900
Sora and Shiro, got it.
Please, thanks.

135
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,802
Ino:
<i>Well, then, let us hear</i>

136
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,438
<i>what you feces‐tossing apes</i>
<i>have to say.</i>

137
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,406
Sora:
I thought you could
read our minds.

138
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,308
Ino:
This is a place of diplomacy,

139
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,777
a place to exchange ideas.

140
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,647
Or is that too complicated for
you knuckle‐dragging gorillas?

141
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,583
Sora:
Don't get pissed.
She just likes us better, Pops.

142
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,717
He's so immature.

143
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,819
Master, I advise you
to be careful not to shatter

144
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,188
the Warbeast's fragile,
dainty heart.

145
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,122
He's so pathetic,

146
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,691
we wouldn't want
to hurt his little feelings.

147
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:41,962
( screams )
Didn't anyone teach
you people manners?

148
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:46,232
All right, gramps, I'll tell you
what we're here for.

149
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,634
How about we play a game,

150
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,803
and you bet your
granddaughter's panties?

151
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,005
And I'll put up
Steph's for my bet.

152
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,807
Hmm?

153
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,943
IF YOU WANTED ME TO ROLL YOU
IN A RUG AND BEAT TO DEATH,

154
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,979
You Should Have Just Said So,
You Damned Monkey!

155
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,815
What? You'd rather have
Jibril's than Steph's?

156
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,584
Certainly, as you wish,
my master.

157
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,686
Sora:
Don't tell me
you want Shiro's.

158
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,589
Come on, gramps, that's sick.
She's only 11 years old.

159
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,923
No, don't tell me.

160
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,859
You don't want mine, do you?

161
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,360
Sorry, but I don't
swing that way.

162
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,397
Shiro:
<i>It's okay, Sora,</i>
<i>I'll protect your chastity.</i>

163
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:19,099
Sora:
Too many choices or what?

164
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,868
Her panties are a pretty
good deal for you, old‐timer.

165
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,771
Please excuse me,
but if you refuse to tell us

166
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,907
why you're really here,
then maybe it's best‐

167
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,942
Drop the pathetic act already.

168
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,476
Hmm?

169
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,513
If you can read thoughts
like you say,

170
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,915
then I'd suggest you go
for the panty game.

171
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,751
Look, I know it's not
the panties you're after.

172
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,253
It's just a low stakes match,
and a good chance

173
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,823
to wipe away all my memories
about your games.

174
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,090
So let's shake on it.

175
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,661
Oh, second‐guessing, huh?
Looks like I was right.

176
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,463
Smells to me like cold reading,
cheap parlor tricks

177
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,466
<i>that don't even need the</i>
<i>amazing senses of a Warbeast,</i>

178
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>just some observational skills</i>
<i>and a bit of intuition.</i>

179
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,074
Coincidently,
that just so happens
to be a specialty of mine.

180
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,543
Ino: <i>Is he...</i>

181
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,549
So you done confirming
this isn't a bluff yet?

182
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,783
( chuckles )

183
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,252
Now then,
since we've established

184
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,287
<i>that your so‐called</i>
<i>mind‐reading ability</i>

185
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,658
is a bunch of crap,
let's get down to business.

186
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,894
Like why we really
paid you a visit.

187
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,167
We, Sora and Shiro,
designated representatives

188
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:31,204
of the 16th order of Imanity
in the kingdom of Elkia...

189
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,274
Shiro:
Have blessed the
Eastern Federation

190
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,911
with the opportunity to become
the first honorable sacrifice

191
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,981
on our path
to world domination.

192
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,817
<i>Therefore, we hereby</i>
<i>challenge you</i>

193
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,219
<i>to a game between nations.</i>

194
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,756
Both:
And we demand everything

195
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,826
the Eastern Federation
has on this continent.

196
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,029
Steph:
A game between nations?

197
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,066
So you mean we're
officially attacking
the Eastern Federation?

198
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,736
<i>Did I really just</i>
<i>hear you correctly?</i>

199
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,338
Yep, and by the way,
we're not changing our bet.

200
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,707
It's still for Steph's panties.

201
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,574
(screams)

202
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,711
Should have just bet
Izuna's panties while
you had the chance.

203
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,913
Sorry, Gramps,
them's the breaks.

204
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,849
And that's a check.

205
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:18,919
Master, could you please explain
the madness going on here?

206
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,155
What's wrong, Jibril?
You still don't understand?

207
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,425
Basically, we've got the
Federation backed into a corner.

208
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,627
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Over the last 50 years,</i>

209
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,328
<i>their technology evolved</i>
<i>pretty rapidly,</i>

210
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,196
<i>and they grew more</i>
<i>and more powerful,</i>

211
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,166
<i>but despite being so advanced,</i>
<i>they're still an island nation</i>

212
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,802
<i>that needs resources</i>
<i>from the mainland.</i>

213
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,138
<i>Before they could even set foot</i>
<i>on the main continent,</i>

214
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,542
<i>Elven Gard attacked,</i>
<i>or perhaps they were lured in.</i>

215
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,077
<i>Either way, no other country</i>
<i>would agree to play</i>

216
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,814
<i>an unknown game that even the</i>
<i>strongest nation kept losing.</i>

217
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,950
<i>The Federation couldn't</i>
<i>get onto the continent.</i>

218
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,284
<i>They should have just lost</i>

219
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:53,019
<i>so more countries</i>
<i>would challenge them,</i>

220
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,121
<i>but for some reason,</i>
<i>they didn't.</i>

221
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,858
Let's solve these mysteries
in order, shall we?

222
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,325
Question one!

223
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,828
Why do they wipe all
memories of the game?

224
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,497
If they don't, they won't
be able to win every time.

225
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,368
Correct! It defeats the goal
of luring others into play.

226
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,804
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it's not entirely logical,</i>

227
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,172
<i>they wipe memories</i>
<i>because there's something</i>

228
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,107
<i>they're trying</i>
<i>to keep secret.</i>

229
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,643
<i>But still, you can erase</i>
<i>people's memories</i>

230
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,179
<i>but not the fact</i>
<i>that they lost.</i>

231
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,346
Question two!

232
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,049
Why'd Elven Gard challenge
them four times?

233
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,217
They knew
that they might lose,

234
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,820
but they wanted to figure out
what the game was.

235
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,222
Unlike Elkia, Elven Gard
is a really big country.

236
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,257
They were prepared
to suffer some losses

237
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:32,559
to do their research.

238
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,228
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>After their first loss,</i>
<i>they figured it must have been</i>

239
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,197
<i>a game where you</i>
<i>couldn't use magic.</i>

240
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,432
<i>An Elf would think</i>
<i>that was the most likely reason</i>

241
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,001
<i>they'd lose a game.</i>

242
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,003
<i>So they came up with</i>
<i>some kind of countermove</i>

243
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,939
<i>and challenged a second time</i>
<i>and lost again.</i>

244
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,141
Then they played a third time.

245
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,844
I'm not sure how,
but they figured something out.

246
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,946
So they went back to using
their official cheats

247
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:56,817
they call magic and made their
fourth and final challenge,

248
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,785
and they lost again.

249
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,021
That's quite
an imagination you have.

250
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,556
Sora:
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>I'm not too concerned</i>

251
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,658
<i>with the way</i>
<i>they lost.</i>

252
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:07,761
What I want to know is why
they stopped after four games.

253
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:11,464
<i>If you think all that's just</i>
<i>my imagination, that's cool.</i>

254
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,367
I mean, you're old
and kind of grumpy. I get it.

255
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,236
I see two options.

256
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,973
<i>The first‐ they realized</i>
<i>the game was impossible to win.</i>

257
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,944
And then the Elves could've
exposed the cheating and won.

258
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,613
Or second, they learned
the tricks of the game

259
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,015
<i>but could never figure out</i>
<i>why they kept losing.</i>

260
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,285
So that's why the Elves
stopped challenging them.

261
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,388
But still.

262
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,892
Now that's odd.
So what do we have here?

263
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,827
You were able
to figure out the game,

264
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:43,296
but you have no idea
why you kept losing.

265
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,532
Starting to get good,
party people!

266
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,267
Time for question three!

267
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,671
What works equally well
on these very different races?

268
00:12:50,671 --> 00:12:52,506
What game would be
a guaranteed win

269
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,408
made by technology only
the Federation would have?

270
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,211
And the answer is?!

271
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,114
They made a video game where
you can cheat all you want.

272
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,149
Both:
They made a video game?

273
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,785
What the hell is a video game?

274
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,853
I doubt that you'd know,
Steph, but, Jibril,

275
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,922
you challenged the Eastern
Federation once already,

276
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:10,591
so how come you'd never seen

277
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,258
that thing at the
entrance before?

278
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,628
Jibril:
<i>Uh, well,</i>
<i>I guess that's because‐</i>

279
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,296
Sora:
Because you'd forgotten it.

280
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,332
It's a memory
associated with the game.

281
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,135
Still, despite all that,
if a Flugel like Jibril

282
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,904
doesn't know anything
about them,

283
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,405
it's pretty safe to say
the Federation

284
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,608
is the only country
in the world with video games.

285
00:13:27,608 --> 00:13:31,144
You erased the memories to keep
the games a secret because‐

286
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,913
guess what everyone‐
in a video game

287
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,114
where you're the game master,

288
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,482
you can keep cheating your
ass off till the cows come home.

289
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,252
And your opponent,
who's busy running in circles,

290
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:39,920
stays clueless.

291
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,422
Plus, if you don't even know
what cyberspace is,

292
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,456
then magic's pointless.

293
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,859
All that mind‐reading garbage
is just a cover story

294
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,360
so your opponents
won't look closer

295
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,696
and find out
you're cheating, right?

296
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:52,032
Hang on,
we're almost done here.

297
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,034
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>So you can tell</i>
<i>when someone's lying,</i>

298
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,103
<i>but there's no way</i>
<i>you can read their mind.</i>

299
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,807
And the final question is?

300
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,307
Golly!

301
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,544
How in the world were they able
to figure all this out?

302
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:08,481
The answer's on the house, pops.
Do you care to take a guess?

303
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,951
Ino:
Don't tell me
it was the former king.

304
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,486
We made him swear by the pledges
to tell no one,

305
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,790
but even he didn't realize
we couldn't read minds.

306
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,491
No, that's not
the problem here.

307
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:22,262
Sora:
Right, that's not
the real problem.

308
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,497
<i>You made the former king</i>
<i>promise not to speak</i>

309
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,499
<i>about the games to anyone,</i>
<i>but since he did,</i>

310
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,469
<i>it proves you couldn't</i>
<i>read his mind. How?</i>

311
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,606
<i>'Cause he pledged to tell</i>
<i>no one so long as he lived.</i>

312
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:37,110
<i>That doesn't mean he couldn't</i>
<i>tell anyone after he died.</i>

313
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,379
So now that we know all about
your devious game,

314
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,882
are you starting to get
a little worried, Old Man?

315
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:42,816
<i>'Cause if you're not, Gramps,</i>

316
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,217
<i>we'd be happy</i>
<i>to go to the Elves</i>

317
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,019
<i>and tell them</i>
<i>all about your tactics,</i>

318
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,421
<i>and you'd be forced</i>
<i>to play them all over again,</i>

319
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,724
and you'd lose.

320
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,127
At this point, it's in your best
interest to erase our memories.

321
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:56,129
But if you're prepared
to bet your territory

322
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,364
just for Steph's panties,
then I guess that means

323
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,667
my imagination
must be correct.

324
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,268
Damn it.

325
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,403
Ino and Sora:
<i>Then that means...</i>

326
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,238
Your only other option
is to claim my theory

327
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,040
is just a load of crap
and run away

328
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,510
from our challenge,
right, Old Man?

329
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,278
Both:
But you said
you could run away?

330
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,347
I'll make it worth your while.

331
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,416
I'll throw in all of Imanity.

332
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,417
Huh?

333
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,585
Huh?

334
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,587
<i>( Steph screams )</i>

335
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,756
And Imanity's race piece!

336
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,424
( all gasp )

337
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,893
K‐Kurami?
Why is‐

338
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,228
Listen, Fiel.

339
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,763
Do you know of any games
in the past

340
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,932
where someone bet
a race piece?

341
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,367
Of... of course not, never.

342
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,102
If you bet your
race piece and lose,

343
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,705
then you also lose
all your rights as an Exceed.

344
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,405
That means...

345
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,508
That the ten pledges
no longer apply.

346
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,344
In other words,
we're no better than animals.

347
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,614
It's like a death sentence
for all of Imanity.

348
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,784
That son of a bitch!

349
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,519
Sora, are you insane?

350
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,855
I've bet our entire territory
and put the lives

351
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:56,790
of all Imanity on the line.

352
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,025
If you try to back out now,
that's like telling

353
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,929
the entire world
that my imagination was correct.

354
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,831
Bet you didn't see
that coming, did you,

355
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,133
Mr. Freakin' Mind Reader?

356
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,137
Check and mate.

357
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,808
Ino:
<i>Are you sure you</i>
<i>want to do this?</i>

358
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,643
Even if you're correct,
keep in mind

359
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,246
Elven Gard still lost
this game four times.

360
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,950
Plus you dare bet
your precious race piece?

361
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:27,020
<i>Do you want your people</i>
<i>to go extinct?</i>

362
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,288
Say, Old Fart,

363
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,324
remember when I flagged
you down from the library?

364
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,660
<i>Maybe if you'd thought</i>
<i>about how we could do that,</i>

365
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,598
you'd have realized that the two
of us are not from this world.

366
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,434
When it comes to video games,
you can use as many cheats

367
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,970
or assists
as your heart desires.

368
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,205
None of that will help you.

369
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,208
Blank will never lose
to anything like that.

370
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,644
Sora:
<i>When we showed up here...</i>

371
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,846
Shiro:
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>we would just roll over</i>

372
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,516
<i>like easy prey?</i>

373
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:59,586
Now it's your turn to be
the hunted, Warbeast friend.

374
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,023
Who the hell do these two
think they are?

375
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,325
( chuckles )
Well, guess
you can't agree

376
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,761
to a game of this scale
on your own, right?

377
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,229
We can do this another day.

378
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,564
We're betting our race piece,

379
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,666
so all of Imanity
has the right to watch.

380
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,835
The four of us are ready,
and we're not gonna

381
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:15,902
let you squirm
out of this.

382
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:16,436
But wait‐

383
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,371
I don't really get
any of this, thanks.

384
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,308
But, Sora, and Shiro,
sounds like you buttwads

385
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:24,745
challenged me to
a fight, so thanks.

386
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:26,613
A fight? No way.

387
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,249
Izuna, let's play a game
next time, okay?

388
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,918
I won't lose to losers,
thank you.

389
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,754
Sorry to disappoint,
but you will.

390
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,357
Everyone knows,
Blank never loses a game.

391
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:45,198
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>See you soon,</i>
<i>Little Izuna.</i>

392
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,739
Steph:
<i>You idiots, what the hell</i>
<i>were you thinking?!</i>

393
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,141
Do you realize what you've done?
And what if you lose?

394
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,777
What the heck
are you gonna do?

395
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:57,377
I don't know.

396
00:17:57,377 --> 00:18:00,581
If we lose, we're pretty much
done for, so what else is there?

397
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,716
I know if we lose,
it's game over

398
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,350
for us and three million people,
but if we win,

399
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,654
we get the animal girls
and their land.

400
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,789
Not too shabby, eh?

401
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:10,891
Isn't it so
exciting, Shiro?!

402
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,058
It's so exciting.

403
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,294
What... What's
wrong with you two?

404
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:18,198
Sora:
Just relax, Steph.
It's just a game, right?

405
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:18,832
Steph:
<i>I knew it.</i>

406
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,467
<i>It was stupid and naive of me</i>
<i>to entrust these people</i>

407
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,103
<i>with my</i>
<i>grandfather's hopes.</i>

408
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,772
If it bothers you, Dolly,
then consider this‐

409
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,341
if the Masters win,
every Warbeast on the planet

410
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,844
will be stripped of their land
and also their rights

411
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,345
and possibly face death.

412
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:36,016
<i>Who do you think should take</i>
<i>responsibility for that?</i>

413
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:38,519
<i>Jibril:</i>
<i>We rule each other</i>
<i>and kill each other</i>

414
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,320
<i>through games</i>
<i>instead of violence.</i>

415
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,224
<i>The losers are exploited,</i>
<i>enslaved, and killed.</i>

416
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,227
<i>That's the essence</i>
<i>of the ten pledges,</i>

417
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,495
being daring enough
not just to risk your own life

418
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,665
but also the lives
of all your people

419
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,368
just for the tiniest opportunity
to defeat your enemy.

420
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,939
Those are the qualities
we need in a ruler.

421
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,306
Sora and Shiro:
Huh? Say what now?

422
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,342
Steph and Jibril:
What?

423
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:05,111
Don't tell me you guys haven't
figured it all out yet.

424
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,614
The way to win,
the way to beat this world.

425
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,516
Steph and Jibril:
The way to win
and beat this world?

426
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,252
Well, now I see why God
gets so bored of this place.

427
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,020
Poor Tet.
I feel sorry for him.

428
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,022
Sora:
<i>Don't worry, guys,</i>
<i>we'll conquer the hell</i>

429
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,626
<i>out of this world as promised,</i>
<i>the whole damn thing.</i>

430
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,661
We won't lose.

431
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,228
There's no point
in even planning

432
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,697
for that sort of outcome.

433
00:19:23,697 --> 00:19:26,867
No chance of us losing,
you got me?

434
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,435
And that's checkmate.

435
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:32,038
Man:
<i>Come out here, you stupid kids!</i>

436
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,341
( <i>indistinct conversations</i>
<i>and angry shouting</i> )

437
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,052
Jibril:
My, how quickly their attitudes
have changed almost overnight.

438
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,387
Steph:
How do you think
you'd feel

439
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,322
if you were suddenly given
a death sentence?

440
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,124
I think it's actually
pretty strange

441
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,326
that they're acting
this calm.

442
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,529
Are you going to do anything
to quiet them down?

443
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:57,598
Shiro:
<i>If they were that mad,</i>
<i>they could try</i>

444
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,265
<i>and take the throne</i>
<i>back from us.</i>

445
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,067
Sora:
It's just a bunch of whining,

446
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,704
and I doubt any of them
have the guts to challenge us.

447
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,405
<i>More importantly,</i>
<i>what's the hold‐up?</i>

448
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,707
<i>It's been a week already.</i>

449
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:08,942
You mean why the Federation
hasn't picked

450
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:10,243
a date for the game yet?

451
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,446
With their whole country
at stake, I'm sure it
will take some time.

452
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,949
Yeah, I figured
as much.

453
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:19,219
I'll just wait for someone with
more of a backbone to show up.

454
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,622
All:
Uh, huh?

455
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:24,691
Sora:
<i>Looks like they're</i>
<i>finally here.</i>

456
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,327
<i>Kept me waiting long enough.</i>

457
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,931
Yeah, of course
I know what you guys want.

458
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:33,233
I'm ready when you are.

459
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,769
Shiro, listen up, 'kay?

460
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,742
You know
that I believe in you.

461
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,846
Yeah, I know.
I believe in you too, Sora.

462
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:49,883
Shiro, never forget
the two of us are always one.

463
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:50,350
( gasps )

464
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,153
<i>The two of us</i>
<i>are bound by a promise.</i>

465
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:57,991
Shiro, we're not the heroes
of some stupid kid's manga.

466
00:20:57,991 --> 00:21:02,829
<i>Shiro, we've always won the</i>
<i>game before it's even started.</i>

467
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,097
Sora?

468
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:08,802
I'll get the last piece to beat
the Federation, okay, Sis?

469
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,072
Sora?

470
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,007
No! W‐wait!

471
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:20,346
Sora:
<i>( echoing )</i>
<i>Let's get this game</i>
<i>started, shall we?</i>

472
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:55,776
( moaning softly )

473
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,080
Sora?

474
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,716
Shiro, rise and shine.

475
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,385
What's the matter?
Hey, what's wrong, Shiro?

476
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:08,955
Sora? Where are you?

477
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,392
Come help, please!
You can't leave me here alone!

478
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,095
Shiro, who are
you talking to?

479
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:16,029
Who's this Sora guy?

480
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,999
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to go find him for you?</i>

481
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,970
No way.

482
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,373
No way!

483
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:30,443
Shiro, is everything okay?

484
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:34,147
Steph?

485
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,482
Where's Sora?

486
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,652
Where is he?

487
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,486
My brother?

488
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,523
Brother?

489
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:45,926
You have a brother?

490
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,663
<i>And his name's...</i>
<i>what again?</i>

491
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:51,932
Shiro:
<i>I won't let go</i>
<i>of your hand, Sora.</i>

492
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,835
<i>It would feel like</i>
<i>my soul was leaving me.</i>
