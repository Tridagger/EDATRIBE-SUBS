to have given up,

361
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,518
but, the whole time,
she was actually

362
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,553
giving instructions
to everyone.

363
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,655

They’re training the others

365
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:44,891

367
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,561

00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:26,267
Nat and I will climb up first.

376
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,369
We’ll help you guys
once we’re at the top.

377
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:31,772
Don: Hear that? Just do it like
we trained, and you’ll be fine!

378
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:34,174

gonna escape safely!

Isabella: Everything is burning,

382
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,561
all of it.

383
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,563
But...

384
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:01,202
( Laughing )

385
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,745
Ray and Emma,
they’re still alive!

My darlings, I will never
let you escape from here!

388
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,388
