their grades of meat,

were all between 6 and 12,

and if six years old
is ranked as normal,

61
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,758
then the highest quality
must be...

62

63
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,660

we’re harvested in order
from lowest test scores up,

71

the age of 12,

still don’t get it.

dictate the order?

being between 6 and 12
is what matters?

79
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:50,497
Is it the size of our bodies?

80
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,000

weight would be a factor.

( Emma gasps ) That means...

85

must taste the best,

86
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,779
and the more developed it is,
the better.

87
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,214

spend a lot for them,

the next shipment should be
at least two months from now,

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,002
which means you and I
need to come up with a way

97

for all of us to escape
from here before then.

a rudimentary map of the site.

101

The house is in the middle,
lined up with the gate,

102
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,753
and the forest encircles
the rest of the property.

103
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,390
so which exit
do we choose for our escape,

104
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:52,026
the gate or the forest?

105
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,928

110

112
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,806
when we’re able to get
out of the house freely,

113
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,174
or during shipping, when mom’s--

114
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,242
Emma: We can’t wait
to do it during shipping!

115
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,411
That plan means
someone we love dies!

116
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,647
Norman: You’re right.
And i’m also worried

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,383
the younger ones won’t be able
to stay awake during the night.

118

119

through the forest,

exactly where naila was.

184

Emma: Well, actually,
now that you mention it,

185
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,281
mom’s always been really good
at finding us.

186
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:04,285
She found us quickly,
no matter where we hid.

187
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:07,054
Norman: Wait.
That’s not a watch.

188
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,222
- It’s a tracker.

Norman: Then that probably means
we have a chip inside us.

190
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,763
She did that on purpose,
pulled out her "watch"

191
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,698
so we’d see and figure it out.

192
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,101
That must be mom’s way
of telling us,

193
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:24,270
"no matter who you are,
I won’t let you escape."

where to look.

201
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,361
we’ll meet up
in the hallway at 10:00.

203
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,832
if they have
tracking devices on us,

204
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,302
then what if there are cameras
or listening devices also?

205

215

When we tried to deliver
little bunny,

216

219

mom doesn’t know where we are
at any given time.

220
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,336
She can only tell our location
when she checks.

221
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:32,439
What she does know is that
someone other than conny

222

brought little bunny
to the gate that night.

223

However, I don’t think
she’s figured out who yet.

224
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,915
Otherwise, she wouldn’t have
warned us so indirectly.

aren’t even six years old yet.

342

homing beacons.

take a bad situation

Emma: What do you mean by that?

356
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,660
Ray: We don’t know
what’s waiting outside

357
00:16:33,694 --> 00:16:35,296
beyond this wall,

358
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,665
but there’s a place
we’re getting shipped to.

359
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:40,167
The fact that there’s
a farm and a buyer

360
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,035
should give you an idea.

361
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,538
What waits outside
is a demon’s world.

362
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,606
There is no place
for humans to live.

363
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,175
It was never meant for our kind.

364
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,177
( Emma gasps )

365
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,212
Ray: So it’s impossible.

366
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:55,015
if we take everyone,
then we’ll all die out there.

367
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,484
We leave them behind.

368
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,020
That’s the best option.

369
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,088
Emma: No way.

370
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,723
( Ray gasps )

371
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,459
Emma: Even if it’s impossible,
they’re all coming!

372
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,627
- We can figure it out!
- ray: What?!

373
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,429
Emma: I don’t know
what’s on the outside,

374
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,032
but leaving part of our family
behind isn’t an option!

375
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,635
I want conny to be
the last one they take.

376
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:20,140
Never again. I won’t
lose anyone else like that.

377
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:22,643
If there isn’t a place
out there for humans to live,

378
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,578
we’ll carve one out
for ourselves!

379
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,546
together,
we’ll change the world!

380
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,415
- ( Ray gasps )
- Emma: Thank you, ray,

381
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,083
for helping me to understand.

382
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,353
We’re planning an escape
where we get everyone out.

383
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:34,855
I’m not bending on this.

384
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,790
- I’ve decided.
- ( Ray gasps )

385
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,392
Emma: You have to come to grips
with my plan, ray,

386
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,795
so stop jabbering, and help us!

387
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,730
- ( Ray grunts )
- ( Norman laughing )

388
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,602
Ray: How can you just laugh?
Her plan is suicide!

389
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,604
emma: We’re escaping
with everyone, and that’s it!

390
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,806
I won’t agree to anything else!
I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!

391
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,608
Ray: Someone should
knock some sense into her!

392
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,143
She’s unreasonable!

393
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,444
Norman: Yeah, totally!

394
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,579
i’m glad she’s
her old cheerful self.

395
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:01,381
Ray: You’re missing
my point, Norman!

396
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,883
Stop her, or you’ll both die!

397
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,885
Of course, you knew all that

398
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,754
from the very start,
didn’t you?

399
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:09,923
Norman: You didn’t see
the way she cried.

400
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,926
- ( Ray gasps )
- Norman: That night,

401
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,929
I thought she was crying
because she was terrified.

402
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,832
I know now that I was wrong.

403
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:20,735
what I saw there
made me afraid of dying.

404
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,736
Emma was scared,
but it was the thought

405
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,538
of her family dying
that horrified her.

406
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:29,476
She’s so amazing,
to be in that situation

407
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,245
and worried
about protecting others.

408
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,913
Ray: But it’s a lost cause!

409
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,749
The three of us could make it,
but trying to take everyone,

410
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,218
it’s like making
a boat out of mud!

411
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,253
( Norman sighs )

412
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,821
Ray: You should be scared.

413
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,689
There’s nothing
to be ashamed of.

414
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,559
don’t let feelings
cloud your vision! We’ll die!

415
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,427
Norman: I do see clearly.

416
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,596
i want to build
a boat out of mud as well!

417
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,299
Ray: Huh? Don’t be a fool!

418
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,334
You’re supposed
to be different!

419
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,603

422
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,575
- Norman: Because of Emma...
- ( Ray gasps )

423
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:03,443
Norman: And how i’d do anything

424
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:05,312
to always put a smile
on her face.

425
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,548
Ray: You’ve gone crazy.

426
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,717
And what if Emma dies
because of it?

427
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,721
Norman: That won’t happen.

428
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:18,459
I will make sure of it,
and i’ll do whatever it takes.

429
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,428
Look on the bright side.
I’ve always been able

430
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,930
to accomplish
whatever I set out to do.

431
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,800
If you bake mud,
you can make a vessel,

432
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:30,338
so a boat that’s made out of mud
wouldn’t necessarily sink.

433
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,838
Ray: You’ve lost your mind.

434
00:19:31,872 --> 00:19:33,073
Norman: You think?

435
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,709
Perhaps Emma and I
are both insane.

436
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,011
We’ve completely lost it,

437
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:40,581
so you can’t
let us do it alone.
