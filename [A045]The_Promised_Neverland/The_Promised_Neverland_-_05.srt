it was behind my bed,

to guarantee our safety.

to execute the plan,

we wouldn’t have gone.

for us to find out the truth
about this house for ourselves.

You set this up for the three
of us to escape, didn’t you?

Norman: If you were
completely on mom’s side,

110
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:28,028
then it wouldn’t make sense
to reveal the truth to us.

111
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,632
You’ve been controlling
our actions,

112
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,601
about the trackers,
the timing of our escape,

113
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,404
and how quickly
the plan moved forward.

114
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,407
That’s why you didn’t want us
leaving ten days from now.

115
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:45,913
But, at the same time, you were
also keeping mom under control.

not our enemy, are you?

Ray: If you’re going to learn
more about the enemy,

124
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,469
it’s best to do so
from the inside,

125
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,105
which is why I ended up
offering a deal to mom.

126
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,306
Norman: That’s risky.

127
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,975
Ray: Not really.

128
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,645
I’m one of the finest products
she’s raised here.

129
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,446
She cared a lot for me.

130
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,981
She wouldn’t throw me away.

131
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,183
That’s how I saw it.

132
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,386
She’s someone who cares more
about profit than rules.

133
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,989
i made sure
to ask for two things.

134
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:33,160
First was not to be shipped out
if I cooperated.

135
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:36,397
The second was rewards
in exchange for results.

136
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:37,898
Norman: What kind of rewards?

137
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,301
Ray: Various junk.

138
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:43,470
If it isn’t in the house,
she secures it for me.

139
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,539
- Norman: Huh?
- ( Ray grunts )

140
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,408
My reason for doing it

141
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,010
was to check what I
could and couldn’t get,

142
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,313
but also to research
the outside.

143
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,182
turns out,
as long as it was safe,

144
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,418
she could get me lots of things,

145
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:00,053
but everything
she brings back is dated.

146
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,889
norman: So, then,
when you said you had an idea

147
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,157
for breaking the trackers...

148
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,427
Ray: I’ve seen the real device.

149
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,929
I did testing.

150
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,565
It took me a few years,
but I figured it out.

151
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,568
it is possible
to break the tracking devices.

152
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:17,171
- ( Norman gasps )
- Ray: You get it?

153
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,240
Norman, i’m the strongest card
you’ll ever have.

154
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,075
No one else compares.

155
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:25,646
And I don’t just have info about
the tracking devices and mom.

156
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,647
You can’t even begin to imagine

157
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,050
how much i’ve learned
over the years.

158
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,556
from the moment
that I discovered the truth,

159
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,591
I started preparing.

160
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,026
Norman: Ray...

161
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,227
Ray: I had you and Emma
go to the gate

162
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,397
without having anyone notice.

163
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,001
All of this, just to make sure
you both don’t die!

167
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:56,076
but i’m not your ally either.

168

Let’s make a deal.

169
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,547
if you agree,
i’ll become your trump card.

170
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,549
I’ll tell you everything I know

171
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:06,153
and leak false info to mom
if you do one thing.

172
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,588
Norman: What’s that?

173
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,556
- Ray: Trick Emma.
- ( Norman gasps )

174
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,092
Ray: We’ll pretend
we’re taking everyone,

175
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,594
then ditch them later,

176
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,263
but we can take Don
and gilda, too.

177
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,033
Norman: Are you saying we should
give up escaping with everyone?

178

357
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,215
Meaning there’s a secret room
in this house.

358
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,582
Don: Whoa. Really?

359
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,951
Emma: Yeah, located here.

360
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,822
It’s right next
to mom’s bedroom.

361
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:32,092
Mom’s room is connected to both
the bathroom and washroom,

362
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,094
and then, past that,
behind the wall,

363
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,295
is where her office is,

364
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,297
but from what i’ve gathered,

365
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,900
this probably isn’t a wall.

366
00:16:39,967 --> 00:16:41,869
Gilda: Mm. As for me,

367
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,337
what I noticed
was that she disappears

368
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,940
into either the office
or the washroom.

369
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,076
Emma: That said,
I measured the distance

370
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,577
of the inside of the room,

371
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,613
along with the hallway
outside of it.

372
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,514
norman: Oh!
That’s what you were doing.

373
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,283
- Don: Huh?
- Emma: Yeah.

374
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,551
Don: Okay. And?

375
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,520
Emma: They didn’t match.

376
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:03,056
There’s about ten steps
worth of space here.

377
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:06,059
one side’s a wall,
the other has bookshelves,

378
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,329
but i’m guessing there are
hidden doors on both sides.

379
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,832
Gilda: And beyond those doors
is mom’s secret room.

380
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,467
don: Why does
something like that even exist?

381
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,835
Emma: It’s probably for--

382
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,237
ray: Standard check-ins.

383
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,805
I bet that’s where she goes

384
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,473
to check in
with the headquarters every day.

385
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,475
- Makes the most sense.
- ( Girls gasp )

386
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:22,810
Don: Headquarters?

387
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,244
Norman: The base
that supplies babies

388
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,079
and sisters like krone
to this house.

389
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:27,381
( Don gasps )

390
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,082
Emma: I’m curious, ray.

391
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,484
Did you know about the room?

392
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,054
ray: No, but I
had a feeling it existed.

393
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,388
Don: Let’s try to get in!

394
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,456
’cause what if
there’s a way to, like,

395
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,091
talk to the outside in there?

396
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,894
or some clues
about conny and the others?

397
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,197
Gilda: But don’t you think
it’ll be hard to get in?

398
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,098
Don: Who cares?
We still have to try!

399
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,266
Ray: Hold it.

400
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,101
There’s no advantage
in doing that.

401
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,836
I’ve got a strong feeling

402
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,906
that the transmission device
only connects with hq.

403
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:56,310
As for where our siblings were
sent to, mom wouldn’t know,

404
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,012
so I don’t think
we’d find any clues.

405
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:02,149
And don’t forget the trackers
could show her we’re snooping.

406
00:18:02,216 --> 00:18:05,052
That is if the security
in the room doesn’t first.

407
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,953
- It’s too risky.
- Don: Yeah, but--

408
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,355
ray: I’m trying to tell you

409
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,958
that the risks
greatly outweigh the benefits.

( Don gasps )

411
00:18:12,226 --> 00:18:13,327
Norman: I agree,

412
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,462
and we still
have to worry about krone,

413
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,032
so it’s not really wise
to make foolish moves.

414
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,166
Ray: Exactly.

415
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,435
I’ve still got mom
under control,

416
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,571
but we’re done for
if krone finds out.

417
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,572
