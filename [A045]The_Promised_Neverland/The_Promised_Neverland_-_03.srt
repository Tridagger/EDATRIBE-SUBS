so it’s been years now.

than I expected it to be.

for you from the boss.

"those three
can still be shipped out

222

had a disappointing harvest
this year,

227
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,002
and only your plant can deliver
the highest quality goods

228
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,673
that are going to be offered
during tifari.

229
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,375
Isabella: Yes, I understood that
from the start.

230

Please tell the boss,
"everything is going fine.

231

whenever you wish."

So they can be shipped?

233
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,287
The one will most certainly
be pleased by this news.

234

Only the most special meal

235

can be presented to the one,
unlike our fare.

236
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:30,865
Now let us celebrate

no one would notice.

244

Norman: I never knew
about a Mark

245
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,295
from when they took our blood,

246
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,764
and it disappears that quickly?

247
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,500
Emma: Yeah. I knew,

248
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:09,236
but I never even considered
that would be it.

249
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,437
Sorry.

250
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,239
Norman: Oh, no.
You did great, Emma.

251
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:16,310
We now know the location
and the size of the device.

252
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,978
On to the next step.

253
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:20,414
Emma: The next step is...

254
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,648
All: How to break it.

255
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:22,849
Norman: Let’s see.

256
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,252
If we tried to make
an incision...

257
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:27,521
Emma: Mom might lift our hair
and see it.

258
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,756
Norman: She’d catch on.

259
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,324
Ray: You’re right.

260
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,659
well, whether or not
we can break the transmitters,

261
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,661
the tracking devices
implanted in us

262
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,264
aren’t that useful
in the grand scheme of things.

263
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,466
emma: What?
How do you figure that?

264
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,369
Ray: The signal’s so crude,
it can’t specify an individual.

265
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,638
without checking,
she can’t tell where we are.

266
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,774
Even if we get close
to the gate or walls,

267
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,408
it doesn’t notify her.

268
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,977
Emma: But we still have them.

269
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,612
Ray: Yes, but why?

270
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,981
They must be confident
they can come after us

271
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,384
as long as
the tracking device is intact.

272
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,719
Norman: Hold on.

273
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,521
so that means if it
were to send a notification,

274
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,523
it’d only be
after it’s been destroyed?

275
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,325
ray: That’s
a definite possibility.

276
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,827
Emma: What do you guys mean?

277
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,496
Ray: Weren’t you listening?

278
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,232
An alarm probably goes off
once the trackers are broken.

279
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,501
emma: So mom
would find out instantly?

280
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,938
Ray: If a notification function
really exists.

281
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,474
Norman: But knowing
that mom purposefully

282
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,543
clued us in
on the existence of the devices,

283
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,744
we can’t ignore the risk.

284
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,746
Ray: It’s dangerous
to even touch it.

285
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,616
Norman: So we can only
destroy it when we escape.

286
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,319
emma: What?
But how do we deal with it?

287
00:12:32,386 --> 00:12:33,554
We have to know!

288
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,455
Ray: Actually,
i’ve been thinking.

289
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:39,559
The shape and size of it
brings something else to mind.

290
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,762
leave it to me.
I’ll figure out a work-around.

291
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:43,763
Norman: You sure?

292
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:44,965

Emma: If you say so.
It’s all yours.

294
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:51,371
Norman: Now the issue of taking
the other children with us.

295
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:55,609
the problem is
they all completely trust mom,

296
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,411
and they probably
won’t be able to handle

297
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,845
the truth of our situation.

298
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,281
Emma: If we want
to take them, too,

299
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,749
we’re gonna have to lie to them?

300
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,752
Ray: There’s another issue,
insufficient abilities.

301
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,788
To put it bluntly,
they’re a hindrance.

302

at physical activity,

not to mention the babies

for how to deal with that.
