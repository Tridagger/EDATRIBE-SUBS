1
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:16,166
We'll rank all the students
on a scale from A to F.

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,750
It'll be based on their
genomic resonance.

3
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:22,250
The lower their resonance,
the less use we have for them.

4
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,291
Basically, it's a
Void ranking system.

5
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,625
Lemme just bandage it
up aaand, all better!

6
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,208
That girl's Void is the most
useful thing ever, huh!

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,083
She can fix me up anytime.

8
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,875
Thanks again for the healing!
Ever since you treated me,

9
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,625
I've been just fine.
I really owe you one!

10
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,666
When I compare it to yours, it
seems like my Void is useless.

11
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,208
That's not true.
Nobody's Void is useless.

12
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,875
We're all in this together,
doing whatever we can.

13
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,375
So, uh, just keep up
the good work.

14
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:38,333
We did go so far as to
conduct a general Void exam,

15
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:42,916
but I can't get behind Yahiro's
idea to rank everybody by 'em.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,791
I just don't think there's
anything to be gained

17
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:47,041
by making the students
feel unequal.

18
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,500
That said, though, if I smiled
and told you everything

19
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:55,125
was perfect as-is,
I'd be lying through my teeth.

20
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,833
'Cause it's not.

21
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:59,583
Check it, Tsugumi.
Us security guys are starving.

22
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,791
You don't mind fast-tracking
us our grub, right?

23
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,000
Wait your turn!

24
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,833
Yeah, of course! I was
just messin' around!

25
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,500
We've got all kinds of problems.

26
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:16,666
And that red line is getting
closer and closer all the time.

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,583
Just how long can we hold out?

28
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,791
It's not good.

29
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,833
Our resupplying efforts
are running further behind.

30
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:27,375
That means we're short on
ammo. And our barricade's

31
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,208
nowhere near strong enough.

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,000
The ranking system
would clear that right up.

33
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,041
People work harder
with in a hierarchy.

34
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,750
How often I gotta say it?

35
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,250
Look, that's not something
I'm ever gonna be okay with!

36
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,333
Discrimination by Void is wrong!

37
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,083
We'd be categorizing,
that's all.

38
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,791
That's just semantics, y'know?

39
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:51,250
If they feel like it's
discrimination, then it is.

40
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,166
For whatever it's worth,
I understand how you feel

41
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,041
about it. But that red
line keeps creeping in.

42
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,583
That's the reality.

43
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,833
Yeah, I know it is, but still.

44
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,000
Sympathy will get you
killed, often as not.

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,750
That's what Gai always said!

46
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,208
I get it, you don't want people
to dislike you--am I right?

47
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,625
No, you're not! I--

48
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,583
What do you feel like doing?

49
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:19,208
None of them is in charge. You
are. What do you want to do?

50
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,666
Kay, I'm good. Thanks.

51
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:50,375
Um. Ayase, what exactly is going
on between Shu and Inori?

52
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,000
Huh? What are you
asking me for?!

53
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,250
Yeah! I wanna know
what's going on, too!

54
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:57,041
Tell us, Aya--what're
ya waiting for?!

55
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,583
Seriously, how come
you're asking me this?

56
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,500
Back there, I didn't expect
that. I mean, Shu seemed to be

57
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,500
against the ranking system
'til she spoke up.

58
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:09,208
It's just that she could
see he was on the fence

59
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,000
about the whole thing.

60
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:14,916
When Shu was put in charge,
I was so happy.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,291
I knew he'd be just like
a king should, kind.

62
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
A king, huh?

63
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,166
King Shu! I guess that pretty
much is his job title.

64
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,208
You don't have to
tease me about it!

65
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:30,375
Sooo, when you gonna
tell him you like him?!

66
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,416
Geez, chill out!
No point rushing her into it!

67
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,833
Hafta! Girl's got a
rival! "Nothing ventured

68
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,625
nothing gained," right?

69
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,916
Cut the crap already!

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,875
"Categorizing," my ass! That's
straight up discrimination!

71
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:46,583
Yeah. That's why
I'm not doing it.

72
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,458
What the hell are you
thinking?! I know you're

73
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,666
my friend and all but
I am really pissed off!

74
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,833
I said I wasn't gonna do it!
Dude. Stop yelling at me.

75
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:59,583
You did, huh. Dude, my bad.
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to be

76
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,708
a jerk just now! I'm gonna bow!

77
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:03,833
Forgive me!

78
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,125
Souta, don't bow to me--c'mon!

79
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,791
Put 'er there, then!

80
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,791
No harm, no foul,
you know what I'm sayin'?

81
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,833
Yeah.

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,458
Okay, then. Let 'er rip, buddy!

83
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,875
Excuse me?

84
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,458
You know, shout stuff
dramatically into the darkness.

85
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,125
It's a male-bonding thing.

86
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,875
They do it in movies
all the time!

87
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,916
People shouldn't be ranked
cause of their usefulness!

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,208
Discrimination really sucks!

89
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,625
What he said.

90
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,458
I love Inori Yuzuriha!

91
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,500
Hey, what's that got to do
with male-bonding?

92
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,375
That's part of it. Baring
your soul an' junk. C'mon!

93
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,166
Fill those lungs and go for it!

94
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,666
Yeah, okay.

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,041
I stumbled into
the job of president,

96
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,750
but I'm not qualiiiiified!

97
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,541
The truth comes out!

98
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,416
I don't think there's
anything wrong with

99
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,875
wanting people to like me!

100
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,083
I don't think there's
anything wrong with

101
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,208
wanting girls to like me!

102
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,291
The Void ranking
system is stupid!

103
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, guys! I've decided--

104
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,833
It's not enough. No matter
how you do the math.

105
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:12,541
Well, what if we
inject less of it?

106
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:16,083
No point. Anything less than
a full dose is useless.

107
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,416
Problem, Shu. A big one.
Vaccine's running low.

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,625
If nothing else, we need
to make sure we have enough

109
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,541
on hand to keep Shu healthy.

110
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,166
Wait a sec. I don't want to
be given special treatment.

111
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,625
You realize if you get
sick, this whole school

112
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,416
is a sitting duck.

113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,250
For whatever it's worth,
we can give vaccine priority

114
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,583
to all of the strongest Voids.

115
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,708
I've compiled a roster by rank.

116
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:44,625
Students will get the vaccine,
or not, based on this.

117
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,416
What?! Souta's number
is that low?!

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,041
If we don't do this, Shu,
we're all as good as dead.

119
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,458
It's your call.
You're the president.

120
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:55,791
The student body chose you.
And now their lives are

121
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,375
in your hands.

122
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,833
I found it while I was cleaning
the student council room.

123
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:06,500
So what is this "Void
ranking system" all about?!

124
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:09,083
Whatever it is, we're all
buried at the bottom of it!

125
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,875
Wait, does this mean they're
writing us off or something?!

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,416
Shu.

127
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,166
You said no ranking,
right? Tell them that.

128
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,416
Yeah. That's right.

129
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,541
We have a favor to ask.
Well, more like a request.

130
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,208
We want you to
pull out our Voids.

131
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,333
Huh? What for?

132
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,000
We need some practice
time. Think about it.

133
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,875
When you used it, my Void was
all badass and saved the day.

134
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,916
But when I'm holding it, it's
all I can do to get dinner open.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,416
I can do better. We all can.
We just need to use 'em more!

136
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,208
C'mon! It's the
least you can do!

137
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,125
Give us a chance!

138
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:55,708
Hook us up!

139
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,583
Please, Shu!

140
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,625
We wanna be useful, that's all!

141
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:58,541
Just this once!

142
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,166
Yeah!

143
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,958
Give us the Voids!

144
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,333
C'mon, man!

145
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,458
Oh, they'll come. Now that
they're running low on vaccine,

146
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,041
they've precious little choice.

147
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,208
They're just a bunch
of high-school pukes.

148
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,333
Killing them isn't
worth my suiting up.

149
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:16,416
My dear Lieutenant, when that
patriotic young hologram

150
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,541
offered to hand over Funeral
Parlor members the other day,

151
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,083
I don't recall
you opening fire.

152
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,291
If I were in your shoes, I'd be
anxious to prove that Daryl Yan

153
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:31,250
is a man of action.
Rumors can be so harmful. Right?

154
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,666
You want action, huh?!

155
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,625
I didn't mean to offend.

156
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,500
You're quite good at this.
But then, a strategist of

157
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,833
your caliber should be.

158
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,458
Did you mean what you
said to me? If I beat you

159
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:49,666
in a game of chess, you will
allow me to see him in person?

160
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,875
Wanna know? Better win.

161
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,500
I kinda had a hunch you'd
be here. Everyone's looking

162
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,041
for you, y'know.

163
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,041
I'm feeling pretty low,
Hare. I really screwed up.

164
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,625
What do you mean,
you screwed up?

165
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:22,458
Hell, you want the full
list? Well, let's see.

166
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,583
I only ever think about
what people want to hear,

167
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,791
and I'm sick of it.

168
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,291
Huh?

169
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:31,333
First I agree with Yahiro.
Then I pull a 180 with Souta.

170
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,875
I'm so wishy-washy.

171
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,791
Everybody does that a little
bit. It's how folks get along.

172
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:39,541
I'm the leader.
I don't have that luxury.

173
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,416
I gotta be stronger than that.

174
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,250
Uhh.

175
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:57,041
It's all right. Because, there
are a lot of wonderful things

176
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,083
about you, too--you know that?

177
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,791
You go through life without
drawing attention to yourself.

178
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:06,125
Whenever you pull out a chair,
or set something down,

179
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,666
you do it softly.

180
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,166
And that's what
I love about you.

181
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,000
Just means I'm
the wrong guy for the job.

182
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,750
Do you really lo--

183
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,875
Don't say it!

184
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,791
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say
that again--it just slipped out-

185
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,041
What's going on?!

186
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,416
Some students just went AWOL,
and Souta's one of 'em!

187
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,833
Are you sure?!

188
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,875
Positive. But they're
all holding Voids.

189
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,583
Does that mean you okayed this?

190
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,625
Okay, guys. That clinic
should be just up ahead.

191
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:56,375
They wouldn't have taken the
vaccine with 'em, would they?

192
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,458
Souta! You know it
isn't safe out here!

193
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,083
Wow--thanks for the heads-up!

194
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,958
What, you think we're stupid
just 'cause we're Rank F?!

195
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,083
We're gonna bring a bunch
of the vaccine back.

196
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,416
We'll see who's
so damn useless then!

197
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,958
Don't tell me this is
what you were planning

198
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,458
when you asked for your Voids!

199
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
Sucks when a friend
lies to ya, doesn't it?

200
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,541
Guess that makes us even!

201
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,541
That's not fair!
I meant what I told you!

202
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,250
Oh, crap! The Anti-Bodies!

203
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,041
Run! All of you! They're
gonna kill you, dammit! Go!

204
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:38,791
They got us cut off!

205
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,333
We're so dead!

206
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,583
You can't just stand
there! Fight back!

207
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,666
With this?!

208
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,125
Are you okay?!

209
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,625
I have to draw them away!

210
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,166
We've found Ouma, sir.

211
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,958
Wait, he's still alive?

212
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,958
You make him
your priority target!

213
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,125
If Shu Ouma
survived the attack,

214
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,625
maybe that girl did,
too- Who the hell cares?

215
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,250
Quick, Hare! Use your Void
to fix that car over there!

216
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,166
Fix a car?

217
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,666
So we can escape!

218
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,875
Shu's distracting them so we
can get the hell outta here!

219
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,750
Souta!

220
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:30,291
What's he trying to do?

221
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:32,083
C'mon--hurry up!

222
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,958
Sorry! I'm trying!

223
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,833
Bandages?

224
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:40,375
You're gonna need way more than
those when I'm done with you!

225
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,041
Hare! Run for it!

226
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,625
Hare!

227
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,916
That idiot! What the hell's he
thinking?! We need him back

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,958
at school, where it's safe!

229
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,375
There! We got three choppers!
And four Endlaves!

230
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,375
Backup, huh?

231
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,916
Your orders?

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,333
You're asking "Kill 'em all"
Daryl how we're gonna play this?

233
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:17,000
Weapons hot, moron!

234
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,958
I didn't want this.
I didn't want this!

235
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,708
They're in range!
But so are we!

236
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,000
Shu!

237
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,166
No! Please!

238
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,000
Shu, when you were little,
did you ever read a book

239
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,833
called "The Kind King"?

240
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,708
It's about a king,
who's so good to his people.

241
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,416
He gave them all the money,
and all the land they could

242
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,791
ever want until he gave
the whole kingdom away.

243
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:50,708
He'd done what they wanted,
but they hated him for it.

244
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:54,875
It's silly, but I really loved
that storybook king.

245
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:03,041
I think he was my first love.

246
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:06,833
And you remind me
so much of him.

247
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:11,250
You're kind to people,
and all they do is hurt you.

248
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,583
Hey. We still got
a live one down there.

249
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,041
I know that you're
going to be a great king.

250
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,958
I've always known.

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,583
Not yet.

252
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:53,083
Just in time.

253
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:06,375
You have my heart. Forever.

254
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,916
Huh? What happened?

255
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,208
No! Hare!

256
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,458
Hare!

257
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,375
Shu.

258
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,166
Noooo!

259
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,083
Took you long
enough! Let's play!

260
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,166
How'd he do that?!

261
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,416
Oh my god. Shu.

262
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,083
Get outta there!

263
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,125
You bastard!

264
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:05,208
Shu! Shu, I-

265
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,041
I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

266
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,916
It's all 'cause I wanted her
to fix up that stupid car!

267
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,666
Yeah, it is.

268
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,166
Shu!

269
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,083
Hare died because
of your stupidity.

270
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:22,458
You wanted to play the hero.
And Hare paid the price.

271
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,625
I didn't know--!

272
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,958
It shoulda been you
who died out there!

273
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,416
Stop! That is enough!

274
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,708
Hare died
because of you, Souta!

275
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,583
You're sorry, huh?!

276
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,791
Then bring her back
to life, you piece of shit!

277
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:38,166
I can't! I can't! Just stop!

278
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:46,625
No one else believed
in me like she did.

279
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:51,166
She saw through all
my mistakes. Hare!

280
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:53,625
Shu!

281
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:56,125
Come on. Let's get
back to campus.

282
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,875
Hey, man.

283
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:14,375
All this time,
I've been such a fool.

284
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:19,708
Kindness is just
another word for weakness!

285
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,750
No more giving the students
the ruler they want.

286
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:28,333
I'll give them
the one they deserve.
