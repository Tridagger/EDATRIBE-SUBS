1
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:45,875
Blooming wildflower I beg you,
please tell me

2
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:51,125
Blooming wildflower I beg you,
please tell me

3
00:00:51,208 --> 00:01:01,166
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

4
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,750
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

5
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:15,541
Valiantly blooming flower

6
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:22,958
What can you see
from your field?

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,958
Why can't people
forgive each other?

8
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,666
Have you secured the key?

9
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,541
Yeah.

10
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,125
Well done. I'll guide you out.

11
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,208
Rendezvous in thirty seconds.

12
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:51,833
The rain passed,
and summer took on blue hues

13
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:59,708
All alone now

14
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:07,541
You trembled before me

15
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:15,708
Without saying a word

16
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:39,541
When your friends
wilt around you

17
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:47,041
What do you think?

18
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:52,500
With your leaves unable to
speak, how do you convey love?

19
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,916
Please, Funell.
Get this to Gai.

20
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:15,291
Summer's sun clouded over,
the wind streamed by...

21
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:19,583
I've got you covered! Now
hurry and get the key to Gai!

22
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,875
Go, Funell.

23
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,208
...sing the proof that you lived

24
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,541
Oh, crap!

25
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:43,458
For the sake of those
who have no names

26
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,833
Rise and shine, Shu. You look
dead. Didn't you sleep well?

27
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,750
Eh. Not exactly.

28
00:04:22,833 --> 00:04:27,041
Up all night on the old
interwebs? Or playing an RPG?

29
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,416
Hey. What's that?

30
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,208
Uh. Just some flash cards.

31
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,208
Fine. Don't tell me. Jeez.

32
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,916
There's more of them out
than usual today, huh?

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,833
Didn't you see the
news this morning?

34
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,625
There was a terrorist bombing
or something yesterday.

35
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,791
Let's see. Apparently the
attack happened in Ward 24.

36
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,125
Hey, Shu!

37
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,125
Yeah, I know, sorry, I'm still
not done with the video

38
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,416
for the competition. Sorry.

39
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,916
I'm not here
to bust your balls.

40
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,291
Oh, well what else
would you want?

41
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,916
Don't worry, I'll have
it finished by the deadline.

42
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,583
Man, what's wrong
with you?! All I said was--

43
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:21,833
C'mon, Souta. Leave 'im alone.
He doesn't wanna talk right now.

44
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,583
Poor Souta. That was rude.

45
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,833
It was? 'Cuz I'm trying
really hard to be

46
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:30,083
more socially
perceptive and stuff.

47
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,833
Really? You're not succeeding.

48
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:32,958
Well I'm trying, anyway.

49
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,291
You're just too, dense.

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,583
Please rise.

51
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,333
Am I really dense? I just
feel like my mind works

52
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,750
out of step from everyone
else's. I never know what to

53
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:50,750
say to other people. It's like
I just can't figure it out.

54
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,750
So I hide my anxiety and
agree with whatever they say.

55
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,958
And that's how I've made
all of my pseudo-friendships.

56
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,541
Japan operates as a
"quasi-independent" nation

57
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:06,041
these days. That's how my mom
puts it. It's been ten years

58
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,000
since the Apocalypse Virus
pandemic broke out.

59
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:12,625
And ravaged our country.
We had no choice but to

60
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:16,291
rely on an incredible
amount of foreign aid.

61
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,291
And we still haven't
broken that dependence.

62
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,500
Our government is constantly
on the verge of collapsing.

63
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:28,208
Japan is consistently
reminded of that fact.

64
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:31,041
Our governance
isn't our concern.

65
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:36,416
According to them. We don't have
the power to protect ourselves.

66
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,958
I can't help but feel
like I should be doing

67
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:46,875
something more than I am. But
what? It all seems so pointless.

68
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:05,333
Blooming wildflower

69
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:13,166
I beg you, please tell me

70
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:23,208
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

71
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:29,458
Why do people fight
and hurt each other?

72
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:37,375
Valiantly blooming flower

73
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,666
What--

74
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,500
No, no! I'm sorry! I wasn't
trying to sneak up on you!

75
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,041
What are you doing in here?

76
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,875
Uh. I'm not done with it quite
yet. It's just my home to--

77
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,000
It's pretty.

78
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
Really?

79
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,000
Uh. Do you want some
of my rice, maybe?

80
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:34,000
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down, falling down.

81
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,500
London Bridge is--

82
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,166
So um, you're Inori, aren't
you? You're the lead singer

83
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,750
for Egoist.

84
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:47,958
London Bridge is falling down,
falling down--

85
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,958
So, what's a famous singer
like you doing here?

86
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,958
How'd you get so banged up?

87
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,208
I need to get this
vial to Gai.

88
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,708
Take this.

89
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,250
Take it. Go on.

90
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,958
I'm Shu. Shu Ouma.

91
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,583
You know. You have to
at least try. You'll never

92
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,000
be able to do anything
if you're too afraid.

93
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:16,458
Tell me, Shu Ouma.
Are you afraid?

94
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:28,750
What? What the hell. Was that?

95
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,500
Funell.

96
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,791
Wait, Inori!

97
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,166
Not so fast.

98
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,958
Are you a student?

99
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,208
Uh, yes, sir. I don't
know if you noticed,

100
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,791
but that girl is injured
pretty bad. You don't have to--

101
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,125
This woman is a criminal. And
if you plan on protecting her,

102
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,958
then we can purge you
too as her accomplice.

103
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,250
What are the results
of the background check?

104
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,208
We have ascertained that she's
a member of Funeral Parlor

105
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,791
in Roppongi, Major.

106
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,791
Worthless terrorist scum.

107
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,625
Let's bring her in.

108
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, sir.

109
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,583
Why the hell didn't I
try to help her?

110
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:51,625
God. What's wrong with me?
What's even worse. I'm actually

111
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,583
relieved now that they're gone.
Just 'cuz I'm not in danger.

112
00:10:56,666 --> 00:11:00,208
That's how pathetic I really
am. Just further proof

113
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,208
that I'm not good enough
for a girl like her.

114
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,416
Take this.

115
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,750
I wanted to take it.

116
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,666
I wanted to be close to her.
And to touch her hand.

117
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,083
Try to forget about it,
Shu. Just clear your head

118
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:23,000
and your heart's bound
to follow. And after that.

119
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,041
Everything'll
go back to normal.

120
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,791
I need to get this vial to Gai.

121
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:42,500
Seriously? You're
asking for my help?

122
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,166
How can I say no?
This might be my last chance

123
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,958
to not hate myself.

124
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,583
It had to be here. Of course.

125
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:16,750
I was told that you felt
the need to dispatch a squadron

126
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,916
to Roppongi.

127
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,083
It was a necessary action.

128
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,333
That can cause unnecessary
violence. I can't allow it

129
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,833
if it's not for an aid mission.

130
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,625
Whatever you think best, sir.

131
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:30,625
We'd still like to hear the
reasoning behind your decision.

132
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,208
Exactly how dangerous
is this stolen Void Genome?

133
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,625
Well, sir.

134
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,000
That's level 3A
classified intelligence.

135
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,083
So classified you
can't even divulge it

136
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,875
to GHQ's Supreme Commander,
is that what you're saying?

137
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:49,375
I'm afraid so, sir. But there's
no need to be concerned.

138
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,750
My Anti Bodies task force
has already apprehended

139
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,208
the culprit and they're
searching for the stolen genome

140
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,708
as we speak.

141
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:05,291
Still don't feel like talking
to us, huh? You must know

142
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,291
that we have the authority to
terminate the infected without

143
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,333
giving any sign of warning. If
you don't tell us where you've

144
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,541
hidden the genome... I'll have
to purify this neighborhood

145
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,541
of every diseased resident
with a sea of fire.

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,583
This was your decision.

147
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,916
Attention all units. All area
residents have been designated

148
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,375
as Stage Four infected. Begin
infection control protocol.

149
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,875
What do you want us
to do with the girl?

150
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait 'til the purge is over
and dump her body outside.

151
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,000
Is this it?

152
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,583
Hey, school boy.

153
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,375
Uh, yeah?

154
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,291
Hey. That thing work?

155
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,666
Huh? What thing?

156
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,750
This thing. The rice cooker.

157
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:19,125
Oh, uh. It works, but I'm pretty
sure it doesn't cook rice.

158
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,416
Leave it.

159
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,583
Uh. I can't do that-

160
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,500
Don't mess with me, kid.
Put it down and walk away.

161
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,708
I wish I could, but it
doesn't belong to me!

162
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:37,125
She risked her life to protect
it. So I can't! I'm sorry!

163
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,875
Well. Look at all these corpses.

164
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,458
Huh? What corpses?

165
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,041
I'm afraid you boys got
yourself into a situation

166
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,625
you're gonna have
to die your way out of.

167
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,458
So you already look like
a bunch of corpses to me.

168
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,833
Dude, is that Gai?

169
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,875
Damn!

170
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,166
You got some balls, pretty boy.

171
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:28,125
Holy shit! It is him!

172
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,250
Um, I'm not with them.

173
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,750
And you don't need Funell.
Now let go!

174
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,375
You're Shu Ouma?

175
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,208
Last I checked, there should've
been a girl with that.

176
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,583
Well she. I.

177
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:20,666
You abandon her?

178
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,333
Heads up! The GHQ
whitecoats have launched

179
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:35,458
a full scale attack!

180
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,541
Evil bastards. Damn them.
They're opening fire

181
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,208
on anyone they see.

182
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,791
Tsugumi. You got
an update on our units?

183
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,583
They just came
online-Incoming enemy!

184
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,125
Beat it! You're in the way!

185
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,333
Run, Shu! And don't
you dare let go of that!

186
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,541
Treat it better
than you did Inori!

187
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:31,083
Alright. What exactly
does that guy think I can do?

188
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:37,541
How many targets?

189
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,750
I can't get a count.
They just keep coming!

190
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,500
Get it together, dammit!

191
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,541
Back it up, pal!

192
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,458
Inori!

193
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,166
C'mon, Shu! Do something out
of character for a change!

194
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,250
What the hell?

195
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,666
What is this?

196
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:18,125
Shu. Please, Shu.
Don't be scared. You can use me.

197
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,416
Take it this time,
Shu. Go ahead.

198
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,291
Who are you?

199
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,875
The power you're feeling.
That is the power of

200
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,875
the Guilty Crown, released
by the bond between two hearts.

201
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,125
What's happening? What is this?
