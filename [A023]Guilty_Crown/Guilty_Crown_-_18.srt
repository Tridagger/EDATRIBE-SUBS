1
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,000
Shu!

2
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,708
What the hell is going on here?

3
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,333
Gai?

4
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,791
He's alive?!

5
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,708
Uh, attention units,
protect Gai Tsutsugami.

6
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,416
Protect him? What the hell for?

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,791
I don't know but
those are the orders.

8
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,625
Please, just follow them,
Lieutenant.

9
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:55,666
You can't be serious. That
guy is enemy number one!

10
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,625
Prometheus One to
Delphi. Target sighted.

11
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:06,625
This is Delphi. Ready the RM
warheads. Wipe them out.

12
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,916
I repeat. Wipe them out.

13
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,291
Hey! Incoming!

14
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,875
Hey, come on, you don't have
to do this! Stop them!

15
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:39,791
Attack.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,416
What the-?!

17
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,583
What happened to them?!

18
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,583
Gai.

19
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,166
Gai! I can't believe
you're alive! But,

20
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,791
why are you doing this?

21
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,750
You, bastard!
I'm gonna kill you!

22
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,250
I'm no longer the man that
you knew. Now choose.

23
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,458
Either you follow my word,
or you declare yourself

24
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,791
as my enemy, and
you die a lonely death

25
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,541
right here and now.

26
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,916
But Gai.

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,083
What did they do to you?!
What happened?

28
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,833
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

29
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,458
Keep away from Master Gai!

30
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,875
Screw this!
There's no way in hell

31
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,958
I'm gonna start
protecting you now!

32
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,041
You're in my way,
runt! Move it!

33
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,916
Time to move!

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,583
Right. I know that voice.

35
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,416
Shu!

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,916
Gai Tsutsugami! None of
it would've happened.

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,125
You're the reason
everything went wrong!

38
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,041
It's all your fault!

39
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,291
Initiate emergency bailout!

40
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,625
Gai!

41
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,500
Are you okay?

42
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:35,333
Keido. It's me. I'm returning.

43
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:39,500
Gai. I was useful, right? I did
everything you asked me to.

44
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,625
You've done exceptionally
well, Comrade Arisa.

45
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,625
As a reward, you've earned
yourself the honor of

46
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,250
a permanent rank
serving Master Gai.

47
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:55,708
It's ironic, isn't it? Our
fleet was mobilized here

48
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:00,208
ten years ago on a relief and
aide mission. And now this.

49
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,333
I'd rather not think that
our efforts of goodwill

50
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,416
were meaningless.
Regardless, this is not

51
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,291
a hostile invasion. We're
simply suppressing the virus.

52
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,958
Burn it down!

53
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,041
The 7th fleet. It's gone.

54
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,958
But that's impossible.

55
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,375
Attention every human being
living on this planet.

56
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,000
My name is Master
Gai Tsutsugami.

57
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,125
The fate of your
world is up to me.

58
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,416
Your lives are
already in my hands.

59
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,500
I wonder how it must
feel to realize that

60
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:46,333
your entire planet
is now a cage.

61
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,458
Your each and every move is
being constantly monitored.

62
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:54,208
You are under the target of
256 Leucocytes. From now on.

63
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm calling a ceasefire.
Military action

64
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,750
is no longer permitted.

65
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:02,750
In addition, Ward 24 is now
a designated forbidden zone.

66
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,416
Trespassing will be considered
a hostile act and you will be

67
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,583
shot on sight by the Leucocytes.
I have only one simple demand.

68
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:13,916
Don't get in my way.
That is all.

69
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,041
Why?

70
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:30,125
Three days have passed since
that foreboding declaration.

71
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:33,125
While the world just waits
in nervous anticipation.

72
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,375
Ward 24 still has not
taken any action yet.

73
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:40,041
And its odd silence is only
adding to the anxiety at large.

74
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,333
And you haven't received
communication from

75
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,541
your people or Shu Ouma? Their
whereabouts are still unknown?

76
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,125
Yes. We have various
reports from the students

77
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,375
who escaped. Each report
claims that Ouma's Void power

78
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,208
seems to have been stolen
by Gai Tsutsugami.

79
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:59,750
How very interesting. I would
surmise that the possession

80
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:04,333
of Void power is the root cause
of this entire situation. Yes.

81
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:07,375
That means it could have been
what they were after all along.

82
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,166
And by them. You mean
the Daath organization?

83
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,708
Who're they?

84
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,791
They're a secret society who've
been around longer than

85
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,250
the Priory of Sion,
or even the Freemasons.

86
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,500
Long enough that most historians
have written them off

87
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,750
as nothing more than a legend.

88
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,666
Which only made it easier
for them to flourish.

89
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,916
They've steadily acquired more
sympathizers over the decades.

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,458
And they've infiltrated every
organization you can think of.

91
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,000
How is that possible?

92
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,500
One more thing. I'm sorry,
sir, but the rumors that

93
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,416
your granddaughter joined forces
with Ward 24 appear to be true.

94
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,291
Is that so?

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,208
Can you handle the rest of the
negotiations with the OAU?

96
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,250
Yes. I'll be fine.
But what about you?

97
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,750
I have personal matters
I must attend to.

98
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm sorry, Shu, but, at least
I've managed to free you

99
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:18,458
from the king's fate.
Live your life, Shu. Please.

100
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,916
We have a report from Team E.

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,208
Block 3 is locked
down and clear.

102
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,125
Alright.

103
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,041
Are you dissatisfied
with something?

104
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,875
I was told that you specifically
volunteered for this assignment

105
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,458
out of your own volition.

106
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,916
Only because Gai-

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,083
Careful, you are speaking
of our great leader.

108
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,541
It's disrespectful not
to call him 'Master' Gai.

109
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,208
Fine. Master Gai.

110
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,375
What do you suppose he
wants with Inori Yuzuriha?

111
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,666
We're the rank and file.
It's not for us to make

112
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,791
suppositions about
his reasoning.

113
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,291
Check, and mate.

114
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:25,208
Oh, dear! You've bested me. But
I must stay true to my word,

115
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,333
mustn't I? I'll secure you
an audience with Master Gai.

116
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:32,333
You lost the game
on purpose, didn't you?

117
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,958
Well maybe I'm curious to
hear some of his answers

118
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:38,666
to your questions.
What's wrong with that?

119
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,208
You have to eat something.

120
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:55,541
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
I was wrong about everything.

121
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:59,041
Dead wrong. I'm sorry.

122
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,500
It appears that
we've located the target.

123
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,708
Excellent. We'll move
out immediately.

124
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,375
It's an ambush!
We're surrounded!

125
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,500
Just stay here. I'll find
out what's going on.

126
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,041
Hold your fire!

127
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,666
Stop it! Stop shooting!

128
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,625
This is difficult to accept.

129
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,250
I never once imagined that you
could be this foolish, Arisa.

130
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,958
Grandfather.

131
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:56,083
Gai Tsutsugami has no interest
in the world outside of his own

132
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,541
selfish goals, it doesn't matter
how much you do for him,

133
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,541
your feelings will
never be returned.

134
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,083
We don't have time for this,
sir. We have an important

135
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,416
mission that requires
our attention elsewhere.

136
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
Why bother hunting
down a helpless boy

137
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:13,291
who's lost his power? You no
longer have any use for him.

138
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,875
Your assumption is erroneous.
Our top priority is the

139
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:18,333
retrieval of Inori Yuzuriha.

140
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:22,208
It doesn't matter.
Especially since

141
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,250
you won't live
to see it through.

142
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,000
I've no choice but to
cleanse my family's shame

143
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,250
with my own hands.
Arisa, I'm sorry!

144
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:47,041
I can see my skills
have slipped.

145
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:49,583
No. Grandfather.

146
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,416
Excellent work.

147
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:08,458
He said that they
were after me, but why?

148
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,583
Take a look at this
flashy piece a ass.

149
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,291
Whatever, man.
Just do her, already.

150
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,833
Inori?

151
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,000
Shu!

152
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,291
Please, help!

153
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,708
Uh. What's wrong?

154
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:52,333
Inori? Inori! Stop it!

155
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,958
What is it?

156
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,541
Inori Yuzuriha, I don't know
what Gai could possibly

157
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,208
want with you. But I've
got you. Put in a request

158
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,708
for an Endlave battalion!

159
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,291
I've gotta get this
under control. With the way

160
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,541
things are going,
I might hurt Shu.

161
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,250
You got it.

162
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:01,000
Shu will inevitably die by your
hand. That's just the way

163
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,666
it is. You are a
monster after all.

164
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,833
A monster?

165
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,250
Even your heart is
a mere facsimile.

166
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,500
Monsters aren't capable of
possessing real hearts, y'know.

167
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,958
Give yourself over to me before
it's too late. It's the only

168
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:18,958
way to stop yourself from
slaughtering him. Right?

169
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm a monster?
That's all I am?

170
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,000
There's nothing more
to me than that?

171
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,416
Even my heart isn't my own.

172
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,500
Inori.

173
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,875
Hey, uh. I've been meaning
to ask you something

174
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,458
but I wasn't sure
how to say it.

175
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,041
What is it?

176
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, um. I've been wondering
why your Void is-You know what.

177
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,958
Just forget I said anything.

178
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:52,041
Are you sure?

179
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:56,541
Yeah. It doesn't matter
what's inside you, y'know?

180
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,125
You are who you are
and that's what counts.

181
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,833
Shu's right. I'm me.

182
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:26,000
Wildflower, boldly blooming

183
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:29,000
Tell me how people
live so violently

184
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:34,208
Inori.

185
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:43,875
Help me understand
How this cruelty began

186
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,166
Will the fighting never end

187
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,625
Why am- Why'm I crying?

188
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,666
Listen to me, Shu.

189
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,541
I don't want you to
condemn yourself anymore.

190
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,416
You don't have to blame
yourself for what's happened.

191
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I've developed so many wonderful
feelings I didn't know before

192
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:12,208
from being with you. I am
who I am thanks to you.

193
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:16,291
Even if the entire world
has turned against you now.

194
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,000
Even if you won't
stop hating yourself.

195
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,541
No matter what,
I'll always be on your side.

196
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,583
What's this about?

197
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,666
You need to know
that before I go away.

198
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,291
I'm the one that
they're searching for, Shu.

199
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,291
It'll be the perfect
distraction. And then you can-

200
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:57,083
Not a chance in hell! I would
rather die than sacrifice you!

201
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,583
Sleep well, Shu.

202
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,375
She is a monster.

203
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:03,708
Maybe I am a monster, and
maybe my feelings aren't real.

204
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,666
But I don't care.
I'm gonna protect Shu.

205
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,875
Because he's
a part of who I am!

206
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:19,500
Even if my feelings for him
are fake, they always felt real

207
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,458
to me. They're the only real
things I've ever known!

208
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,458
Fool. Look what's
become of you.

209
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,125
You've belonged to this cause
ever since they created you.

210
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,916
And yet you think you
could just hand yourself

211
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,500
over to some human. Monster.

212
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,041
Inori?
