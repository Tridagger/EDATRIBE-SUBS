1
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:17,166
We're entering Tokyo
airspace. Three minutes until

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,416
our drop point.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,916
Open the hatch.

4
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,500
We're bound to be tracked,
so this is a one-time deal.

5
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:27,416
You won't get any
second chances. Got it?

6
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,916
That's all that's left of Tokyo?

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,750
So your granddaughter's at
the top of the rescue list?

8
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:41,875
I know how it sounds, but the
leader of the Ming Hua Group,

9
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,583
the largest conglomerate in
Shanghai, is in love with her.

10
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:48,500
We have a deal. He'll help
negotiate a peace treaty

11
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,208
in exchange for
her hand in marriage.

12
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,666
Are you sure? You'd basically
be selling your granddaughter.

13
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,500
I never thought I'd have
to make such a compromise.

14
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,916
Nothing could've truly
prepared us for these times.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,375
Prepared us for the many tolls
the decline of a nation takes.

16
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,333
I'll make sure the escape route
is laid out and secure.

17
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:11,000
We'll rendezvous 36 hours
from now as ordered.

18
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,250
Good luck down there.

19
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,541
Thanks.

20
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,958
Am I really seeing this?
Tokyo got this bad in

21
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:02,416
a matter of weeks?
It's insane.

22
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,000
Just back off! We found
this before you guys

23
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,416
got here!
Get away from us!

24
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
They've sunk to
hoarding vaccines?

25
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,708
What the hell, that's a Void.

26
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,000
We're always on the
lookout for new recruits

27
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:32,583
to join our ranks. Swear your
allegiance to President Ouma.

28
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,458
It's a quick and easy
way to not get killed.

29
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait, President Ouma?
So they're his guards?

30
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,708
Not now!

31
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,500
Ya think we should
ice her, Nanba?

32
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,041
She sure wanted to kill us.
And I bet her Void is trash.

33
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,250
Agreed.

34
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,916
Drop the tough guy act,
you pampered brats.

35
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,958
Ya gonna kill a girl who
doesn't know what a safety is?

36
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,375
Pick another way to show off.

37
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,416
An enemy.

38
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,208
Wait, Miyabi.

39
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:12,333
Check out that emblem. You think
he's a part of Funeral Parlor?

40
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,500
Could be. Who's asking?

41
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:33,208
Hold on. You're seriously
tellin' me Shu's runnin' things

42
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:37,833
round here?
That's freakin' absurd.

43
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:39,541
How's this place standing?

44
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
Watch it.

45
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,250
Oh calm down. Sorry about
her. She worships the ground

46
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,333
the president walks on.

47
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,083
Now that's just weird.

48
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,333
Reporting. Official
Secret Service members.

49
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,625
Ritsu Takarada
and Miyabi Herikawa.

50
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:01,458
What's the resonance gauge say?

51
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,583
It's higher than
you'd expect. Not bad.

52
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:07,083
You never know. We've
got one that might be

53
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,041
worth checking out.
Wanna take a look, Shu?

54
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,958
Shu.

55
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,125
I can't draw it out like that.
I need her to look at me.

56
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,958
Wait. Please!

57
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,166
Congratulations. Your
Void puts you in Rank A.

58
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,416
Use your power to work hard for
this school and you'll be fine.

59
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,166
Me? Seriously? I'm Rank A?

60
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,750
Hey. Ouma.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,166
Argo. Can't say I was
expecting to see you today.

62
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,791
I'm glad you're alright, though.

63
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,083
It's quite the setup
you've got goin' here.

64
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,166
Only out of necessity.
We're pretty sure

65
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,083
the government's in possession
of a new genomic weapon.

66
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,583
What makes you think that?

67
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,708
Well, because.

68
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,208
We saw one of our own students
fall victim to it not long ago.

69
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:33,083
Yeah, well good luck with that.
Listen, I'm here looking

70
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,916
for someone; know where
I can find the old president,

71
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,500
Arisa Kuhouin?

72
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,416
Sounds like you have
some kind of business with her.

73
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,041
Her grandfather's tasked me with
the mission to bring her back

74
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:48,416
to the other side. So then. Ya
think ya could point me to her?

75
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,458
I'm sorry. Shu's schedule is
pretty full. You don't mind

76
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:55,666
if we walk and talk, do you?

77
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
Sure, whatever.

78
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,958
What the hell are they doing?

79
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,791
Look. It's an army transport
ship that got left behind

80
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:22,333
during the confusion. It's chock
full of ammunition and vaccine.

81
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:25,208
So now you're down there
picking the bones dry, huh?

82
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:30,333
Crafty little buzzards.
What the?! Those guys-

83
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,125
--They're all symptomatic!
--Your suit's not gonna hold.

84
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,625
Figure something out.

85
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,750
It's okay. They get first
priority status for the vaccine

86
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,166
as long as they get
their work done, see?

87
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,250
Are you joking?

88
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:40,875
Why?

89
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:41,791
Captain.

90
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,041
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,750
The records show you're
not hitting your quotas

92
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:47,125
and I'd like to know
if you have a reason why.

93
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,125
The symptomatic students
are only capable

94
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,958
of so much labor, sir-

95
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,291
Something's wrong!
Pump 12 is jammed!

96
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,833
Who's down there?

97
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,125
It's Souta Tamadate from 2-A!

98
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,125
Do we have a spare?

99
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,625
No, sir. We're already
using all of them.

100
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,208
No choice then.

101
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,833
We've still got that oxygen tank
we salvaged somewhere, right?

102
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:08,541
We need it.

103
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:09,708
Hold on.

104
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,291
His diving suit
should be equipped with

105
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,458
a small emergency tank.
If he uses that,

106
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,583
all he has to do is cut
the hose and escape.

107
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,708
There's a switch on
the helmet. He has to

108
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:29,041
figure it out for himself. Stand
down. This is his problem.

109
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,958
Are you for real?!

110
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,000
You're gonna let him die?!

111
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:31,791
That's evil!

112
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,166
Just help him!

113
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,000
We simply don't have
the resources to be

114
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,541
wasting on a Rank F.

115
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:40,500
You what? Why don't you say
that again, you bastard!

116
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,000
Keep your distance.

117
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,541
Try using your brain.

118
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,041
We'll be screwed
if Shu becomes symptomatic.

119
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,416
Alright. I've had enough
of your shit, Shu.

120
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,833
Argo! I've given
them my orders!

121
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,458
Your orders are idiotic,
jackass. Don't go thinking

122
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,125
you're my president.

123
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,291
Listen.

124
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:12,875
I can't allow you to be
insubordinate. Not right now.

125
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,333
We're in the middle
of planning our escape.

126
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,750
To succeed, I need
every last person to

127
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:22,291
fall in line and work together.
Dissent is unacceptable.

128
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,500
You want everyone
to stand together.

129
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,458
Yet look how you're
treating these guys.

130
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,416
We're in a crisis, here.
As much as I'd like to, we can't

131
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,625
treat everyone equally
if they don't have the power

132
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,916
to help our cause.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,458
And I can't give you Arisa,
either. Her Void is far too

134
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:41,291
useful to us. Besides which,
our people escape together

135
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,416
or no one does.

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,541
I need to hear you give me
your allegiance. Or else.

137
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,708
I'm gonna take option B.
With this power trip you're on,

138
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,750
I'd rather die
than follow you.

139
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,625
Restrain the traitor.

140
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,333
Yes, sir.

141
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,750
Inori. Don't tell me you've
just fallen in line like

142
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,500
the rest of the mindless sheep.

143
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,500
Not at all. I've chosen
to follow Shu.

144
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,250
I want a guard watching Arisa,
just to be safe.

145
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,625
Yes, sir.

146
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,458
Damn, he pisses me off!
Who the hell does that brat

147
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,125
think he is now?!

148
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:41,250
One speck of power and
look what he's become!

149
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,958
He's been different since
a friend of his died.

150
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,416
That you, Tsugumi?

151
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,208
Yeah. Good to hear
your voice, Argo.

152
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,583
I heard some rumors that you
were hiding out at the school.

153
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,500
Is Ayase with you?

154
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,000
No. She kinda flipped out
when she heard that Shu

155
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,666
had put you in a cell.

156
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,291
Why are you doing this?!

157
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,125
I'm only following the protocol
outlined for dissidents.

158
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,833
I can't make an exception
just because he's a friend.

159
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,166
Think of how that would look.

160
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,958
I get that you haven't
gotten over Hare's death,

161
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,000
but you've changed so much.

162
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,166
You get it?

163
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,541
I guess people's hearts
are just an open book to you,

164
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:20,708
aren't they?

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,708
I'm glad there's no one else
around. If any other person

166
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:38,000
had seen that, I would've had
no choice but to punish you,

167
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:42,333
no matter how high
your rank might be.

168
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,250
That guy is seriously messed
up. The thing I don't get is

169
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,708
why everyone's going
along with all of this.

170
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,416
To be perfectly frank,
they're terrified.

171
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,916
There's the constant stress
of the red line closing in.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,333
The fear of the
Apocalypse virus.

173
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,875
Rampant violence and looting
throughout the streets.

174
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,708
Measured against that, the
Void system is all too easy

175
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:09,250
to accept. It took Shu less than
a second to gather his kingdom

176
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,458
when he decided
to become their ruler.

177
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,583
A kingdom by the Voids
and for the Voids.

178
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,458
That's what this school
has been reduced to now.

179
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,166
Damn it.

180
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:39,250
Well, Mana. Take a look at this.
Shu's picking up your pieces

181
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,875
with all his might. He's
finally starting to realize

182
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:50,541
his potential. But he's still
not quite there. Not yet.

183
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,125
We need to put more
pressure on him.

184
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,041
So our plans are on track.

185
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,458
There's clearly
a direct correlation,

186
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,875
the further the line advances,
the more followers

187
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:06,875
little King Ouma
seems to accrue.

188
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,208
You're stockpiling Voids,
aren't you?

189
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:12,500
You surprised me with the
Ghost Unit, but now this?

190
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,833
You prefer not to spare the rod
with your motherly love.

191
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,416
Eh, Dr. Ouma?

192
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,958
I'm only doing what's
necessary of me.

193
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:26,291
After all, these were
Kurosu's wishes.

194
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:35,916
Are you ever gonna leave?

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,375
I'm afraid that's a question
for the Void prince.

196
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:44,125
I hear that a Funeral Parlor
member is being detained.

197
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,958
I believe I have every right
to speak with him directly.

198
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:50,375
The prince is a little uptight
about your wellbeing right now.

199
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,333
He doesn't want you to get hurt
meddling where you shouldn't.

200
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,708
I could protect you
for a cost, of course.

201
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,916
Never underestimate a Kuhoin.

202
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,833
Hey. Yahiro.

203
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:12,833
Is it true that Hare was killed
by some kind of new weapon?

204
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,125
Yeah, it's true. Why are
you asking me that?

205
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,083
There's a rumor.

206
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:22,250
People have been saying that
she died because her Void-

207
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,250
Be careful with what you say.

208
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,625
You report to me if you hear
anyone spreading those lies.

209
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,125
Got it?

210
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:42,708
What should I do, Hare?
It's just everyone's changing.

211
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,416
I'm sure I must look like
some kind of selfish tyrant

212
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
to everyone else.

213
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,750
Does that hurt?

214
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,208
It's not like I'm doing this
to get people to love me,

215
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,958
I'm just doing what
it takes to get everyone

216
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,166
safely out of Tokyo.

217
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,916
And I can't stop until that's
done. Or else Hare will have-

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,125
She'll have died for nothing
if I don't succeed.

219
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,750
You're all I need, Inori.
As long as I have you.

220
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,791
Really? What about me?

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,333
Shu?

222
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,250
I'm sorry to interrupt, sir.

223
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,541
But the Funeral Parlor
member has somehow escaped!

224
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,666
Can I assume
she's in her dorm?

225
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,333
Well, she normally is. Jeez,
couldn't you have told me

226
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,916
you were gonna make a break?

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,375
If you can fool your allies,
you can fool your enemies.

228
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,583
What's the freaking point
in fooling us?!

229
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,666
Things are all messed up
thanks to you.

230
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,416
Please forgive me, Aya!
You're just gonna get captured

231
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,166
by the Secret Service
if you rush out and join in.

232
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,708
Attention all
Secret Service members.

233
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:04,625
Our prisoner is on the loose.
Find him and capture him.

234
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,791
You two search the grounds
around building two.

235
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,875
Yes, sir!

236
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,958
Inori, you hunt down Arisa.

237
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,375
I'm sure she's Argo's
first destination.

238
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:27,875
You? I didn't know you
joined the Secret Service.

239
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,625
I saw him run toward the gym.

240
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,416
Come with me.

241
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,708
Yes, sir!

242
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,458
That's as far as you're getting.

243
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,458
You're cornered, Argo, face
it! Now surrender peacefully.

244
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,541
Well, I'm surprised you have
the guts to show yourself,

245
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,125
but of course you brought
Voids for insurance.

246
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,625
You seem to think that all it
takes to be like Gai is to wear

247
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,041
a cloak, but you're not even
coming close, you poser!

248
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,541
And you never will!

249
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,750
You and me. And you
better give it your all,

250
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,875
'cuz if you lose, you drop
your little king act!

251
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,750
You've gotta do better
than that, Void Prince!

252
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,916
Argo!

253
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,666
What happened? What turned
you into such a little shit?

254
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,958
I preferred the lost
weakling you were.

255
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,708
At least you were
genuine back then.

256
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:36,083
Then why the hell don't
you try taking my place?

257
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,416
You know so damn much,
then let's hear you come up

258
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,666
with some other way
I can keep everyone safe!

259
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,875
Back away from Shu!

260
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,083
You, huh?

261
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,541
And I don't have
the soft spot Shu does.

262
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:52,250
Get up and surrender.
And I mean right now!

263
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,041
Am I, what is this?

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,333
Please, stop. I can't, no.
I don't want to die.

265
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,916
This is Yahiro. Red alert
for Secret Service.

266
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Cordon off the gym. Arrest
anyone in a 30-meter radius.

267
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,208
It doesn't matter who
they are, detain them.

268
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,375
I want the gym
completely sealed off,

269
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,875
effective immediately.

270
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,250
Yahiro.

271
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,625
That girl was perfectly fine,
now somehow she's dead,

272
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,500
just because her Void broke?

273
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,708
We don't know that for sure.

274
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:14,458
It's obvious! You lied
to me about Hare.

275
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:20,125
You said it was a genomic
weapon. So what happens now?

276
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,791
The thing we're protecting
everyone with could be

277
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,083
the very thing that
might kill them?

278
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,125
It's too late to go back now.

279
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,666
This can't be undone.
I knew you'd hesitate to use

280
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,458
your power if you ever
found out about this,

281
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,791
but if we let the Void
system collapse on us now,

282
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,500
every single one of
us will end up dead.

283
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,250
We have no choice
but to keep going.

284
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:46,416
We'll sit on the truth until we
begin the operation. Agreed?

285
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,166
What the hell are you saying?!

286
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,833
You need to stop using
Voids right now! You can't

287
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,041
go into a war like this. Do
you realize how many students

288
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,125
will die?!

289
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,833
He doesn't know
what he's talking about!

290
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:58,708
Open your eyes, Shu!

291
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,416
I know, you're right.

292
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,708
What?

293
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,000
Shu.

294
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,958
If I break this,
Argo will die.

295
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,125
I've gotta warn
everyone right away.

296
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:36,041
I can't believe
Voids are- It's just-

297
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,541
Found you.

298
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:39,750
Inori.

299
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,375
You didn't hold up
your end of the bargain.

300
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,083
I'm assuming that
we can both amicably

301
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,458
put this deal behind us?

302
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,708
I suppose we have no choice.

303
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,041
As an old friend, I have to
give you a word of warning.

304
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,416
You need to get out of Japan
as soon as you possibly can.

305
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:11,375
There appears to be trouble
brewing on the Pacific.

306
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,458
It's finally time.

307
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,125
This is too far.

308
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,666
I doubt Shu will ever
forgive me for this.
