1
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,750
An announcement from the GHQ's
Public Information Division.

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,125
In accordance with
Article 9, Section 3 of

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:22,166
the Infection Control Law,
a quarantine is now in effect.

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,375
Citizens within Loop 7 are
prohibited from venturing

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,750
beyond it for any reason.

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,958
Tokyo's a disaster zone.

7
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,666
Hard to believe it's
only been two weeks.

8
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,958
Two weeks since
everything went to hell.

9
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:38,791
Downtown is in lockdown,
thanks to the worst outbreak

10
00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:43,083
of Apocalypse Virus since
Lost Christmas itself.

11
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:45,583
No working phones, or internet.

12
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:49,041
TV and radio stations
have gone silent, too.

13
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,875
People have gathered at evac
sites, living hand to mouth.

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:57,916
Y'know, much as we
complain about school...

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,291
most of us students
headed straight here.

16
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:04,208
They can't get in touch
with their families,

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:07,791
and they can't go home because
of the Loop Seven quarantine,

18
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,875
so they've been
living at school.

19
00:01:10,958 --> 00:01:13,125
The GHQ keeps putting
out announcements,

20
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,166
saying the quarantine
will end any day now.

21
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,916
Yahiro just scoffs and
shakes his head, but I think

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,541
they'll let us out soon.
I mean, they have to.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,541
Shu?

24
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,583
So, on the roof again.

25
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:30,875
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,625
Guess I am.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,541
Gai.

28
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,750
It's all over now, isn't it?

29
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,416
Ouch.

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,541
The hell am I gonna
do with this, huh?

31
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,000
Well aren't you a fiesty one?

32
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,250
Whatcha waiting for?

33
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,500
Stand up.

34
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,208
Go away.

35
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,500
No need to get
all bitchy about it.

36
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,750
Chill out--all we're
doing's tryin' to help.

37
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,083
I didn't ask.

38
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,833
Oh, I get it.

39
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,666
One of those
"handi-capable" types?

40
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,000
Leave me alone!

41
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,083
Or what?

42
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,958
You gonna stand up
and chase us off?

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,708
Y'know what pisses me off?
Offering to help a chick

44
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,000
and having her throw
it back in my face.

45
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,041
Looks good topside, though.

46
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:13,791
Yeah?

47
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,291
Hey, that's enough!

48
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,250
You got a problem?

49
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,708
What are you
trying to do to her?

50
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,583
You two guys should be ashamed.

51
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,375
Just offering a helping hand.

52
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:26,166
You gotta love thy neighbor
in these times of trouble.

53
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,791
Somebody should
teach you not to butt in.

54
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,833
Missile Kick!

55
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,083
What the hell was that for?!

56
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:42,625
Watch your aim!

57
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,333
You should be
ashamed of yourselves!

58
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,666
Trying to cop a feel?!

59
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,416
Yeah, well it ain't
gonna happen, pervs!

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,625
Not on my watch!

61
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,083
Perv? But I was the
one trying to help --

62
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,708
Mind your own damn
business, cat-ears!

63
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,375
As if! I have only
begun to fight!

64
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,625
Hey.

65
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,041
We won't forget this!

66
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,750
Well, I've already forgotten
about both of you losers,

67
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,208
so keep walking!

68
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,833
Are you all right?

69
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,458
Yeah.

70
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,166
You sure, Ayase?

71
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,208
Positive.

72
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,333
Just a couple
of boys being dumb.

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,125
Now go.

74
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,708
Get out of here already.

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
But you're-

76
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,000
What did I tell you?!

77
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,583
I get in the chair on my own!

78
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,791
I don't want you guys
watching me crawl up into it!

79
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on.

80
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,416
Let's go.

81
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,750
Sure.

82
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:37,250
Aya's in pretty bad shape
these days, y'know.

83
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,791
Makes sense.

84
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:43,000
Us losing Gai seems to have
hit her the hardest of anybody.

85
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:46,166
I wonder if Funeral Parlor's
gonna close up shop.

86
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,625
We got separated from the
other members when everything

87
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:54,708
went to hell. All we can do
right now is hope they're okay.

88
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:58,166
Ayase and Tsugumi are taking
shelter here at the school,

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,541
disguised as students.
And Gai is gone.

90
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,666
The Kuhouin Group has
been consistent about

91
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,250
airlifting supplies in to us,
so we're in pretty good shape

92
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,208
on that front.

93
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,750
I am a little worried about
how much vaccine we're using,

94
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,750
though.

95
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,500
We gotta keep
the virus at bay.

96
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,166
We're gonna need a stockpile.

97
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,750
Think the old man can help?

98
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,125
Yes--of course.

99
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,416
I'll work something out
before the next supply drop.

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,541
Is that necessary, you guys?

101
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,125
I'm sure they're going to lift
the quarantine any day now.

102
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,958
Not worth taking a chance on.

103
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,750
It's already been two weeks.

104
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,083
We're gonna start seeing it.

105
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,333
People get mean at
the two-week mark.

106
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,916
There's been a small riot
in Shinjuku already.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,500
Yeah, you're right.

108
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,416
We've been seeing more fights on
campus these last couple days.

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,375
Everybody's getting
tired, y'know?

110
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,458
Spending half a month away
from your family isn't easy.

111
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:52,208
Maybe if people could relax
for a bit, that might help.

112
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,166
Hold on a second, you guys.

113
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,000
Come up with something, Souta?

114
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh yeah!

115
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,958
We put on a Culture Festival!

116
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,291
Huh?

117
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,958
We'd usually throw one
this month anyway, right?

118
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,833
Come on, guys!

119
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:09,000
You know you wanna!

120
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,416
We're in crisis mode here.

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,708
Or had you forgotten?

122
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,541
Yeah!

123
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:13,708
Duh!

124
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:14,958
Now is the perfect time
to live a little!

125
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,250
Think about it for a minute!

126
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,583
A little fun goes a long way!

127
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,083
I think you may be
on to something.

128
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,000
Tell me you're kidding.

129
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,500
We have enough food
to last us quite a while.

130
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,000
Keep it modest,
and we can pull this off.

131
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,666
The boss-lady
has spoken, Yahiro!

132
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,000
Guess it's not so dumb
after all, huh?

133
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,708
Try to think outside the box.

134
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,166
Is it a good idea
to celebrate right now?

135
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,958
Life has to go back to normal
sooner or later, right?

136
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,666
We should get a head-start.

137
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,166
Guess that settles it.

138
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,583
It's worth a try.

139
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,291
Shu.

140
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,750
You in?

141
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,375
Yeah--why not?

142
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,250
Tell me it's finally playtime.

143
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,458
Soon.

144
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,583
We should have approval
a few days from now.

145
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,291
Meanwhile, I die
from sheer boredom.

146
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,375
They wouldn't begrudge us
a preview, right?

147
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,875
Please, sir -- don't
antagonize them!

148
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,916
Your new position requires
a little bit of restraint

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,083
on your part, Chief Segai.

150
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,500
Goodness.

151
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,666
The part after the bloody
coup's not nearly as fun.

152
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,958
Wouldn't you say?

153
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,291
Uh, if you say so, sir.

154
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,666
I didn't expect you
to agree to that.

155
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,125
I know.

156
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,458
I guess maybe I felt like
living it up a little, too.

157
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,083
So this was inside me, huh?

158
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,791
How come I'm even awake
to hold it this time?

159
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,708
I think it's 'cause
of that last fight.

160
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:39,250
My powers changed,
or mutated, or something.

161
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,375
And when I'm done?

162
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:41,875
Try just letting go of it.

163
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,208
Just when you think
you've wrapped your head

164
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,875
around this whole "Void" thing.

165
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,500
Tell me.

166
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,166
Why are you so interested
in Voids all of a sudden?

167
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know.

168
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:01,958
Curious.

169
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,791
No point, it's all over.

170
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,875
I don't think I'll be
using this power anymore.

171
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,500
Stop kidding yourself, Shu.

172
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,250
What do you mean?

173
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,041
Arisa's convinced herself
things are gonna change soon.

174
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,458
She's right about that.

175
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:17,375
But they aren't gonna
change for the better.

176
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,916
Trust me.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,458
Your right hand is
the best weapon we've got.

178
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,666
The day's gonna come when
you have to pull a Void again.

179
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,958
I'd rather not,
if it's all the same to you!

180
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,750
Aw, quit your
bellyaching already!

181
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,916
It'll be cute!

182
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,166
Oh!

183
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,041
Hey, guys!

184
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,416
You like it?

185
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,541
I don't think I've seen
you wearing that one before.

186
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,041
I'm working the
Animal Maid Café!

187
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,291
You're really digging this
student thing, aren't you?

188
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,583
It beats not having
a roof over my head.

189
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,166
Might as well carpe
diem! Right, Kanon?!

190
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,166
I'm not really the
ear-wearing type, Tsugumi!

191
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,583
Don't laugh at me.

192
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,333
I didn't mean to laugh.

193
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,791
It's a good look.

194
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,125
Where's Inori?

195
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,458
I haven't seen her.

196
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:05,625
Hey, Shu!

197
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,500
Get your butt down here!

198
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,041
A live Egoist concert?

199
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,375
It's gonna be the
festival's main event!

200
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,833
You totally wish
you'd thought of it, huh!

201
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,375
Man, just think of all the
primo footage we're gonna get!

202
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,125
This is gonna rock!

203
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,541
You sure you're
okay with this?

204
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,791
It sounds like fun.

205
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:25,958
I don't mind.

206
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,500
Do you?

207
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:28,625
Not at all.

208
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,000
If you're happy.

209
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,958
Good job, morons.

210
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,375
Throw a festival during
a quarantine, why don't ya.

211
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,333
I guess the virus has already
settled into their brains.

212
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,500
Serves 'em right.

213
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,500
What the hell!

214
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,208
How dare you
just ram into me?!

215
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,625
Watch where you're going!

216
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,333
Oh!

217
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,833
My bad!

218
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,708
But, since you're here already,
how's about you carry 'em!

219
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,416
Son of a-!

220
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,625
I don't wanna carry 'em!

221
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,708
Heck, you might as well
take the bags, too!

222
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,541
Come on.

223
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,458
Why do I have to be
your damn pack mule?

224
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:14,583
You're pretty weak.

225
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,791
You sick or something?

226
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,833
I'm plenty strong!

227
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,708
You gave me
too many boxes, stupid!

228
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:19,875
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,250
Anyway, here you go,
Mister grumpy-pants.

230
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,666
What is that thing?

231
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,166
Payment.

232
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,250
Yeah, as if!

233
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,916
I'm not gonna eat
that awful thing!

234
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,916
When somebody repays
a favor, you say thank you!

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,416
Get it away from me!

236
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,666
Wow, Ayase!

237
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,958
You're good at this!

238
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,958
I've certainly never practiced.

239
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:47,000
Must be beginner's luck
or something.

240
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,916
Well, whatever it is,
it's great!

241
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,625
Sorry to make you
do this, by the way.

242
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,625
It's fine, but,
why'd you pick me?

243
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,833
Guess I must've looked pretty
pathetic, sitting off by myself.

244
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,625
No, that's not it.

245
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:04,166
You know, Shu's a much braver
person than he used to be.

246
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,958
And I think that the change
has to have something to do

247
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,708
with all of his new friends
in Funeral Parlor.

248
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:13,583
So, whatever you did,
thank you.

249
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,458
It really means a lot to me.

250
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,541
Oh yeah.

251
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,083
Yeah.

252
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:19,000
They're here.

253
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,291
Inori Yuzuriha.

254
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,333
Shu Ouma.

255
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,875
Safe an' sound.

256
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,833
This is stupid!

257
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,500
We could crush this place
in fifteen minutes flat!

258
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
Not very subtle, are we?

259
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,416
The grown-ups are deliberating,
Daryl, and while they do,

260
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
we have to keep our
hands to ourselves.

261
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,791
Or appear to, at least.

262
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,041
No interference.

263
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,250
That's an order.

264
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,625
Are we simpatico?

265
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,958
Yes, sir.

266
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,041
What the hell?

267
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,083
This passes for
a treat with them?

268
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,625
Next time I see her.

269
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,958
I'm sticking this thing right
into that little runt's hair.

270
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,041
Welcome to the official start
of the annual Tenno Festival!

271
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,125
You've all worked hard
on this, so go out there

272
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,458
and have some fun today!

273
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,333
Check it out, Aya!

274
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,750
This is so fun!

275
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,958
Just think!

276
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,250
If we went to school
like normal teenagers,

277
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,291
we'd get to do this every year!

278
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,000
So, where do we start?

279
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,708
Awesome! They have
mini-hotcakes!

280
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,083
I'm gonna go grab some--you
hold down the fort!

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,541
Brats're having a festival?

282
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,458
That shit ain't right.

283
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,500
Not when there's folks
all over the quarantine zone

284
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,208
who are barely getting by!

285
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,750
Ain't that the truth!

286
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,291
Didja miss us, fellas?

287
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:53,875
We were off picking the
gang up some new hardware.

288
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,500
Check it out!

289
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,375
You got a Humvee and
a Gautier model Endlave?

290
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,625
Are those real?!

291
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,500
Where the hell'd you get em?

292
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,875
They were gifts.

293
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,041
Freebies, yo.

294
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,875
You gotta be kiddin'!

295
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,083
Some rich guy just
handed 'em over to us.

296
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:12,416
Seemed kinda sketchy at first,
but hey, the price was right.

297
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,708
Handed 'em over?

298
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,666
It just goes to show
how we're carrying out

299
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,166
the will of the people!
Now, gentlemen!

300
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,250
Let's go teach those
entitled little pukes

301
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,833
what it feels like
to go without!

302
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,833
Sure you don't want any, Aya?

303
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,750
They're seriously delicious!

304
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,791
Listen.

305
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,125
Hey, you're in luck!

306
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,250
There's just one left,
and I'm giving it to you.

307
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,958
--Here!
--Stop it!

308
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,250
What's with the attitude?

309
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,000
Why?

310
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,125
Why did you cut it?

311
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,041
Huh?

312
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,458
What do you mean?

313
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:51,125
The day of the attack,
why did you cut my connection?!

314
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,583
I could have kept on fighting!

315
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,875
I could have protected Gai!

316
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,500
Your Endlave was toast.

317
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,458
If you'd stayed connected
any longer, the feedback

318
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,541
would have killed you!

319
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,041
If I could've saved Gai,
then who cares?!

320
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,875
Look at me.

321
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm only half-alive anyway.

322
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,458
I've lost my legs.

323
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,750
Twice.

324
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,916
It really hurts me
to hear you say that.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,666
I couldn't deal
with losing you.

326
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,208
Anyway, you need me,
well, I'm around.

327
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,958
-and then the
music's gonna start,

328
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,666
but don't come out yet, okay?

329
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,375
Wait'll I give ya the signal.

330
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,541
I'll wait.

331
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,000
Inori has her songs.

332
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,416
But I've got nothing.

333
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,750
Without my Endlave,
I'm just dead weight.

334
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,125
Ayase!

335
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:50,333
Oh, hey.

336
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,000
What're you doing
all the way out here?

337
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:54,166
We're over by the stage,
if you wanna hang.

338
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,083
Not much of a point.

339
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:58,250
It's not like I can
help out with anything.

340
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,583
Hey, I'm not trying
to put you to work.

341
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,333
You're our friend, Ayase.

342
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,708
I thought you might
wanna join us, that's --

343
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,458
What about Gai?! Huh, Shu?!

344
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,000
He's dead.

345
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,833
'Cause I didn't protect him.

346
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,708
He's dead because
I wasn't good enough.

347
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,500
You're wrong, Ayase.

348
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,250
I'm the one who
couldn't keep Gai safe.

349
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,958
It's my fault.

350
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,208
An Endlave!

351
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,791
I win!

352
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,500
Why are the rioters
doing this?!

353
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,458
They aren't!

354
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,250
That's military tech!

355
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,208
What in the hell?!

356
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,083
Why're they attacking us?!

357
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,125
Where's Shu?!

358
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,291
Turn around!

359
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,166
You'd be a sitting duck
out there, Ayase!

360
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,083
I have to get you
to somewhere safe!

361
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,291
I don't wanna run away!

362
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,625
Not again!

363
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,416
Dammit Shu, you don't get
to cut my connection!

364
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,625
What's wrong with you?!

365
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,208
Ayase.

366
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,208
Here, let me--

367
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,833
How useless are you trying
to make me feel, Shu?!

368
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:19,416
Useless?

369
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,458
I lost my legs,
but Gai gave me new ones.

370
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,333
Suddenly, I could run
faster than ever before!

371
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,375
But now, Gai is gone!

372
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,916
And they're gone!

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,208
And I can't stand
what I've become!

374
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,625
Please, Shu, just let me
stand, on my own two feet!

375
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,208
Everyone, head for
the old college building!

376
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,375
Keep running!

377
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,625
Hare!

378
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,416
Guess I get two Voids
for the price of one.

379
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,666
Sweet, huh?

380
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:13,625
Uh-huh!

381
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,333
Gai, I'm back
on my feet again.

382
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,166
I'm back in the fight.

383
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,583
I'm back!

384
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,666
What the hell was that?

385
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,958
I dunno!

386
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,541
It's a chick!

387
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,291
That little bitch!

388
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,125
Wanna play?!

389
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,916
Let's play, then!

390
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,958
I think it's time
we wrap this up!

391
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:48,916
I got him!

392
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,625
Go on!

393
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,208
Right!

394
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,750
Told ya you were useful.

395
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,958
Damn it!

396
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,458
You kids are such
a pain in the ass!

397
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,375
Shuuuu!

398
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:45,958
Blooming wildflower 

399
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:53,291
I beg you, please tell me

400
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,041
Why do--

401
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,166
It's been a while since
I really gave it my all

402
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,666
with my own two legs.

403
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,208
It felt pretty good.

404
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,458
I feel a bit better, myself.

405
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,708
I think I just got stuck
in my head a little too much.

406
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,916
Y'know, I still can't accept
that we lost Gai for good,

407
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,750
but at least I think
I'm ready to be a part

408
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:18,541
of the world again. I'm gonna
figure out what I can do.

409
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,208
It's good to have ya back.

410
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,750
Thanks for the help.

411
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,083
Seriously.

412
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,500
You guys, you guys!

413
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,916
We're totally getting
a TV signal again!

414
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,041
Sending the feed to the
big screen in three, two, one!

415
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,375
After a painstaking search, the
conclusion we have reached

416
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,916
is somber indeed.
There are no survivors

417
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,750
within Loop Seven who are
not highly contagious.

418
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,583
Thus, the provisional Japanese
government in accord with

419
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:59,083
the GHQ has halted rescue
efforts and moved to seal off

420
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,125
the area entirely for
the next ten years.

421
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,083
Loop Seven?

422
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,208
We're in Loop Seven!

423
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:04,375
Wait, what's that?

424
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:06,291
Our top priority is the
eradication of the

425
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,125
Apocalypse Virus, so as
to put any fears on

426
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,125
the part of the international
community to rest.

427
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,666
This drastic action will bring
about a new birth for Japan.

428
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,000
So, as the newly-inaugurated
leader of our provisional

429
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:22,791
government, it's my duty to put
these deeds into practice.

430
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,750
He's in charge
of the country now?!
