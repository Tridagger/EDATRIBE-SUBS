1
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,916
Cut the crap!

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,125
We're sick and tired of you
dancing around the issue!

3
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:20,166
I'm not avoiding the issue!

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,541
All I'm saying is that we
shouldn't take any action

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:26,041
until we have more information.
We should be hearing from

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:30,000
the head of the Kuhouins, my
grandfather, at anytime now.

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,750
We just need to be patient.

8
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,166
Come on! You need
a reality check!

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,000
As far as the rest of
the world is concerned,

10
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,125
we don't exist anymore!

11
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,833
They're gonna wipe us out
along with the virus,

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,416
isn't that obvious?
They're gonna kill us!

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,791
We're all as good as dead!

14
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,375
Will you shut up! None of
us knows what's going on!

15
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,458
She's right, please stay calm!
Everyone, try to wait for

16
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,958
your turn to speak until
you have the microphone.

17
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,958
As you've admitted, the biggest
problem we're facing here is

18
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:06,583
that we don't actually know
what's going on outside.

19
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,416
Someone needs to step up,
and directly inspect

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,333
the Loop 7 wall.

21
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:16,958
Why the hell is little
miss president even giving

22
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,458
those idiots the
chance to speak?

23
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,500
Her integrity's
making her look weak.

24
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:24,208
She's just being democratic
and hearing everyone out.

25
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,583
What's wrong with that?

26
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,208
Nothing, in peacetime.

27
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,041
Shu. Something wrong?

28
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,500
Oh.

29
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,708
I can't help but wonder how
Gai would handle all this.

30
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,916
Y'know?

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,041
Please!

32
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,833
You have to do something!

33
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:42,125
I just want to see
my mom and my dad!

34
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:47,375
This is all we're asking
of you. Make a decision about

35
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,208
our course of action.

36
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,166
Telling us to sit around
and wait for your Grandpa?

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,541
We want more from
our leader than that.

38
00:01:54,625 --> 00:01:56,291
Isn't that fair?

39
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,750
Pursuant to Article 32, Section
3 of the council charter.

40
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm filing a no confidence
resolution. Fellow students.

41
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:08,791
I request the election
of a new president.

42
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,291
It's vaccination time again,
guys. If it's your turn

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,583
to receive a dose this
week. Please report to

44
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:48,750
the council room.
Again, everyone on

45
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:51,791
the vaccination list,
report to the council room.

46
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,625
Here.

47
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,083
That's a whole week's worth.

48
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,083
I get the feeling
the dam's finally burst.

49
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,958
Dude, what're you
talking about?

50
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,250
What dam?

51
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,958
This dam. It's the
school's unofficial site.

52
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,833
Take a look.

53
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:08,000
The internet's back up?!

54
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,416
Whoa, it is?

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,958
Well, not entirely.

56
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,666
They suddenly stopped jamming
the school's local network.

57
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,541
But we're still cut off
from the outside.

58
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:17,750
Hey, let me see.

59
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,541
They're really going for
the president's jugular,

60
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,250
aren't they?

61
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,916
She's working her ass off!

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
They're just being mean.

63
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:30,583
You've gotta admit
they have a point though.

64
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,708
Let's be frank here.

65
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,541
She's not really
cut out to be a leader.

66
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,416
Hey!

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,041
That's a crappy thing to say!

68
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,458
She's one of us
and we should stand by her!

69
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,625
One of who?

70
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:43,333
It's circumstance
that forced us together.

71
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,708
You are not as cute
as you think you are, you know!

72
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,416
Jerk.

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,958
So sorry I hurt your feelings.

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,041
Tsugumi, wait!

75
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,666
What's her problem?

76
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,458
Tally up and collect
a list of every student

77
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,291
that wants to leave.
Ammo for the assembly.

78
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,458
Why worry about that, let's just
get rid of the uppity bitch.

79
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,708
Don't be hasty.
We'll save the trump card

80
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,625
as a last measure.

81
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,625
Hey, Inori.

82
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,583
Can I ask you something?

83
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,791
You don't have
any family, right?

84
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,375
Well, do you um,
ever feel lonely?

85
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,375
I have before.

86
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:29,750
Shu wasn't there.

87
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,333
And I felt cold.

88
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,416
Gai said that was loneliness.

89
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,708
So yes.

90
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,666
Oh, one time, huh?

91
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,083
What about you?

92
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,375
Tsugumi?

93
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,708
Are you lonely?

94
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:45,833
What?

95
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,291
Of course I'm not
lonely, come on!

96
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:52,500
It sucks Funeral Parlor's
gone and all, but still.

97
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,833
I was living on my own way
before I joined them.

98
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,583
So I'm a little past
getting lonesome.

99
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:07,666
My whole life, I've always been
alone, as far as I can remember.

100
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,916
So you don't need to spy
on me, Shu, there's nothing

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,583
to worry about!

102
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,791
Okay!

103
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,125
Good timing, though.

104
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:18,833
Got somethin' for ya.

105
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,416
A Genomic Resonance Gauge?

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,125
Yep. To put it simply,
it's a gadget for measuring

107
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:29,833
the strength of a person's
Void. I found it on the ground

108
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,750
after those guys
attacked us yesterday.

109
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,250
Huhh.

110
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,750
From what I can tell, the higher
the number on the readout,

111
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,500
the more butt the Void kicks.

112
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:40,625
Well look at that.

113
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,000
Not bad at all!

114
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,166
What does that mean?

115
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,541
It's not low, is it?

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,500
Actually, what is
Tsugumi's Void?

117
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,916
I've never drawn it out.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,083
I don't know.

119
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,708
Think of what
we're facing now.

120
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,041
We should be prepared and
know what everyone's Void is.

121
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,208
You don't need to worry.

122
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,083
It only hurts
for a split second.

123
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:11,333
Wait, it hurts?!

124
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,041
Alright, Dr. Ouma, the
patient is now ready.

125
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:14,583
Hey.

126
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:15,166
Wait.

127
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,625
Okay, then.

128
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:17,250
Sorry.

129
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,833
Just hold still.

130
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,625
No, hold on.

131
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,250
Stopppppppp!

132
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,000
Report.

133
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,250
Yes, sir. We've deployed
a clean-up crew based on

134
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:44,916
the strategy you outlined.
The next step is to begin

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,208
the purification and to
diminish the blockade zone.

136
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,791
We're ready.

137
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,833
I've created a Ghost Unit
based on the specifications

138
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,916
you gave me and
strategically positioned

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,208
them as our main force.
Well. Your orders?

140
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,916
Begin the cleanse.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,375
Yes, sir!

142
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,166
Commence Operation
Purify Tokyo!

143
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,708
An announcement from the
acting Japanese government.

144
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,708
Please be aware that
as of midnight tonight,

145
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,833
we are minimizing the area
of the quarantined zone.

146
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,333
Anyone attempting to venture
past the red lines will be

147
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,583
immediately purified without
question, so please be mindful.

148
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,708
This is as cheap as it gets.

149
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,541
I don't really give a damn if
it's the president's orders.

150
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,833
There's just not
any sport in it.

151
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,916
And this so-called
Ghost unit, they're not

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,458
connected from here, are they?

153
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,958
And they're clearly
not on the scene.

154
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,333
So where are they
operating from?

155
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,375
That's classified.

156
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,541
Is it true?!

157
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,166
It went down at Koenji.

158
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,291
They slaughtered them?

159
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Things are even worse
than we thought they were.

160
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:47,875
Nanba.

161
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,708
It's a little late
to be up and about.

162
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,833
What're you guys doing?

163
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,875
People are claiming that
there was a massacre in Koenji.

164
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,458
So what now?

165
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,791
You still wanna sit
around doing nothing?

166
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,208
Tell me, Rowan.

167
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,333
Do you have any idea
what caused the ancient

168
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,458
and mighty city-states
of Greece to topple?

169
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,125
What wiped them out?

170
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,166
No, sir.

171
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,583
I'm afraid my major
was in physics.

172
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,458
Demagogy.

173
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,250
I'm lifting the signal jam.

174
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:24,125
Let's give the people
something fun to discuss.

175
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,125
And, send. Now.

176
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,958
Watch the civil
discourse unfold.

177
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:32,375
Pretty sadistic, sir.

178
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,750
I couldn't ask for
a better compliment.

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,875
Thanks a ton
for the help, Gramps.

180
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,291
We couldn't have survived much
longer on the run like that.

181
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,958
Is there any way
we can repay your kindness?

182
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,416
Keido's been busy
since he took office.

183
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,125
All lines of communication
and transport into the city

184
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,250
have been shut down. But I
know there are still plenty

185
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,791
of survivors within the wall.

186
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,333
They must be saved.

187
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,583
It'll be our pleasure
to assist you anyway we can.

188
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,125
Hey, look!

189
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,875
"This is from a solid source.
Someone who got outside".

190
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,750
"If you hand over
Funeral Parlor members,

191
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,958
you can get outside the wall"?!

192
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,583
Shu. Did you hear about
what happened in Koenji?

193
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:22,666
Yeah.

194
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,541
It's most likely
just a rumor, though.

195
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,500
But I know it's the kind of
thing the Anti-Bodies would do.

196
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,333
You don't think they'll do
anything to our school, do you?

197
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,708
It's gonna be okay.

198
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,208
I doubt it'll get worse
than it already is.

199
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,166
At least we're all together.

200
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,708
And if it comes down to it,
I promise I'll fight for us.

201
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:46,041
Well, then I'll make sure
you don't get injured.

202
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,750
Worse comes to worse,
I'll heal you with my Void.

203
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:51,916
Thanks, Hare.

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,125
Y'know, Shu. Don't you
think it would be best

205
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,375
if you were in charge
during all of this?

206
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,291
You should run for
student council president.

207
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,541
Nah, I don't think so.
I'm the last guy in the world

208
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,333
who's cut out to
give people orders.

209
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,500
I just don't think I have it
in me to be a leader.

210
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,416
Yes, you do, I know it!

211
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,708
You've just talked yourself
into believing that.

212
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,791
You could be a king, Shu.
If that's what you want.

213
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,208
Spoken like a supportive
queen. I'm just kidding.

214
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:27,125
Oh, good. Obviously
you're feeling better.

215
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,916
Yeah, well. There's not really
any point in staying upset.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,541
Even if you trampled
on my privacy.

217
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,791
Get her! She's a member!

218
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,625
Noooo!

219
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,916
Hold her still!

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,166
Confess! You're with
Funeral Parlor! Stay down!

221
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,750
It says that members
of the terrorist group

222
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,166
have tattoos on their backs.

223
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,958
Right, let's check.

224
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,083
Get away from her!

225
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,916
What the hell are
you jerkoffs doing?!

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,916
It's none of your
business, back off!

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,750
Take your hands off of her!

228
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,000
What the hell's
going on? Looks bad.

229
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,750
We've got trouble!

230
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,375
There's a rumor online that the
government's offering asylum to

231
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,541
anyone who turns over a proven
member of Funeral Parlor.

232
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:08,416
Are you serious?
Inori and Ayase!

233
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,250
Hey, it's no big deal.
We just wanna make sure

234
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:21,250
you don't have a tattoo
on your back. Okay?

235
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,791
I'll take a look
in the old building.

236
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,833
Sounds good.
Just be careful, Tsugumi.

237
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,833
Inori.

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,208
Something wrong? Shu?

239
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,166
There's an awful
rumor going around.

240
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,958
Did anyone try to hurt you?

241
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:41,291
I'm okay. Nobody's laid
a hand on me. I promise.

242
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,875
Oh. That's a relief.
Come on. Let's go.

243
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,250
Sure.

244
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:53,750
Y'know, I've had a weird feeling
ever since I first saw you.

245
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,250
So tell me. Your class.
What is it?

246
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,583
Move it.

247
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,750
Thought so!

248
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,583
You bitch!

249
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,250
Misslllllle kick!

250
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,166
Let's go, Aya!

251
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,000
Get back here!

252
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,291
Aya!

253
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,083
You idiot, keep running!

254
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,583
Like I'm just gonna
leave you with these jerks.

255
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,708
What a brave little soldier.

256
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,833
We're moving up the assembly.

257
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:29,916
The student body meeting will
now be held in ten minutes.

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,291
This pertains to all classes.
Please head to the gym at once.

259
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,541
We can't let rumors tear
us apart. Help will come

260
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,791
if we wait for it.
The best thing to do

261
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:48,500
is for us to sit tight
and weather the storm.

262
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,041
You've been
saying that for weeks!

263
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:51,708
Can you even say
anything else?!

264
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,041
She's losing them up there.

265
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,625
They're not listening
to her anymore.

266
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,333
C'mon, she needs our support
now more than ever!

267
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,625
I still haven't
seen Ayase and Tsugumi.

268
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,458
There's only one thing
we wanna hear.

269
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,750
Just tell us how we can avoid
being slaughtered, President.

270
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,083
Our only chance for
survival is to hand over

271
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,541
the Funeral Parlor gang.

272
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,625
That's just a rumor!
And I know there aren't

273
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,250
any members of Funeral
Parlor in our school!

274
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,833
That just shows
how little you know!

275
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,208
Let's prove her wrong.

276
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,375
We already found a couple
of members ourselves.

277
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,916
Look! They've got both of 'em!

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,875
As you can see, these girls
are wearing our school uniform,

279
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,250
but had anyone here ever
laid eyes on either of them

280
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,875
before the blockade?

281
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,791
I heard they're supposed
to have tattoos on their backs!

282
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:40,958
Ohhh, they are, huh? Well
You know what that means.

283
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,208
Guess we better check 'em out
right here and right now.

284
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,625
Leave them alone!

285
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,625
Their terrorist organization
is responsible for

286
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:52,875
biological warfare! So shut
up! We've got no choice here!

287
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:58,875
Easy. Just be a good girl now.

288
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,125
Yeah, do it!

289
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,291
Stop this-

290
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:16,083
This is bad. They're goin' full
blown mob mentality here.

291
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,041
We've gotta turn you over!
It's our only chance!

292
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:24,250
It's for the greater good! So
no hard feelings or anything!

293
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:26,958
Stop it!

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,458
Hey, isn't he-

295
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,833
That's the guy who
destroyed the Endlave.

296
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,458
It's Shu Ouma.

297
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,166
What? What's your problem, man?

298
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,375
Take your hands off of Ayase.

299
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,500
I'm part of Funeral Parlor too.

300
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:05,166
Everyone relax. We can
figure this out together.

301
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,375
And I know just
how to do it, too.

302
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,375
Hey, hold on!

303
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,791
I'm turning in
Funeral Parlor members.

304
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:29,208
See! Our high school's
still filled with lots

305
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,583
of students taking shelter.
We'll turn these guys in

306
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,583
if you just let us go home.

307
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,500
It's that obnoxious runt.
She's with Funeral Parlor?!

308
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,250
Go on, get moving.

309
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,375
Whoa, hey. That's just stupid.

310
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:09,291
So what now? Am I free?
Hey, come on. I thought-

311
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
What the hell? They
were gonna let us go!

312
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,666
They said they would!
Why'd they do that?!

313
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:33,250
It should be obvious by now.
We can't trust anything

314
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,750
the government says.

315
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,708
And now you have an idea
of what Shu's power can do.

316
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:44,500
This is my Void. The
replicating hand scanner!

317
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,833
It creates an identical
looking human copy and

318
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:52,708
you can control them remotely!
It's pretty awesome, right?

319
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,291
This situation. I know how
scared everyone's been.

320
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,833
There's a lot you don't
understand. But now you know.

321
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,833
The government's not on our
side. So let's work together

322
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,375
to come up with a new plan.
And let's do it with

323
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,666
a level head.

324
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:16,041
This is all bullshit.
The government. Your powers.

325
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,416
It's all lies!

326
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,291
I told you to
calm down, didn't I?

327
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,250
Try not to piss me off.

328
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,458
You saw it for
yourselves yesterday.

329
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,208
We're capable of
protecting us all.

330
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,083
So you can rest easy
on that. Regardless.

331
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:45,791
Whoever's gonna be our leader.
You need to think long and hard.

332
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,166
Think of a way to
get us out of this.

333
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,333
That's all I had to say.
Thanks for listening.

334
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,041
Not so fast, Shu.

335
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,791
We're not done yet. Alright,
guys. I don't think any of us

336
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:08,833
can disagree with what Shu just
said. So let me ask you this.

337
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,000
Out of everyone in this
gymnasium, who do you think

338
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,916
is most qualified to be
our leader in this crisis?

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,791
Shu Ouma!

340
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:15,750
I vote for Shu!

341
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,583
Shu should lead us!

342
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,000
Hold on. What are you-?

343
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,000
Let's hear a round of applause
from everyone who thinks

344
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,125
Shu Ouma should be our new
Student Council president!

345
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,708
Yahiro. What are you doing?

346
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:41,208
I'll help you with the job.
Just try it. Admit it, Shu.

347
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,708
You know this is what
you're supposed to do now.

348
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:02,875
Wait. Run that by
me again. Yahiro.

We'll rank all the students

350
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,125
It'll be based on their
genomic resonance.

351
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:13,916
The lower their resonance.
The less use we have for them.

352
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,916
From this point on, the strength
of the Void, will tell us the

353
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,708
value of the person. Basically,
it's a Void ranking system.
