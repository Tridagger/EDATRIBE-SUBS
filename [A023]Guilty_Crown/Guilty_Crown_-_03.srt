1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,875
We'll always offer funeral songs
to those who've been selected

2
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:23,166
out of this life. Hence the name
of our group. We oppose GHQ.

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,125
Who carelessly treat our country
as though it belongs to them.

4
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,625
We've declared war on them
and we won't allow them

5
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:33,041
to select us out,
nor our fellow citizens.

6
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:38,208
Well I don't know how you
could've missed this news, but.

7
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:41,833
A national emergency has
been issued. Looks like GHQ's

8
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,125
cracking down after yesterday's
incident in Roppongi.

9
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,750
If you've heard any info
about this Funeral Parlor.

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:50,541
Rumors or whatever,
anything at all, you need

11
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,583
to immediately report
it to the authorities.

12
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:56,125
Oh, and one last thing
before we get started.

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:00,041
Our class has a new transfer
student joining us. Come on in.

14
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,708
Woah, check it out!

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,583
Hey, she's hot!

16
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,875
Everyone. This is Inori.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,583
No way. This can't be real.

18
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:14,041
What's up with him?

19
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,750
Wait. Do I know her?

20
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:16,583
Inori?

21
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,625
Whoa. Seriously?

22
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,875
From Egoist? It is not!

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,916
Of course it is.

24
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,666
Awesome!

25
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:10,500
Hi, I'm Kanon Kusama. I'm the
rep for our class. So I'm--

26
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,416
I made it pretty clear that
I didn't want to join

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,833
Funeral Parlor so what
is she doing at my school?

28
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,208
Uh, Inori!

29
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,750
I was just, uh,
kind of wondering what

30
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:24,125
you think about Funeral Parlor?

31
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,166
Why would you even
ask her that, Souta?

32
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,750
Well, you know. Her songs
kind of sound like the stuff

33
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,666
they stand for. So I thought
she might support them.

34
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,875
Yeah, well you
sound like an idiot!

35
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,833
Uh. So, what are
the other members

36
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,166
of Egoist like?
Are they pretty cool?

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,916
You think I could
get your autograph?

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,833
Yeah, me too!

39
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,583
Come on, guys, lay off.

40
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,833
Don't put her on the spot
like that. Sorry, Inori.

41
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:49,833
This guy here is named Souta
Tamadate. And he's an enormous

42
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:53,833
fan of yours so try to
overlook his excitement.

43
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,958
He'll eventually calm down.
I'm Yahiro, by the way.

44
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,041
Yeah. Me and Yahiro and Shu
over there have this club.

45
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,958
It's called the Contemporary
Visual Culture Club

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,750
and it's really cool!
So, uh, you think you'd--

47
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:09,041
Seriously, man, chill out.
Everyone just relax. Really.

48
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,000
We're going to be in the same
class for the rest of the year.

49
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,916
Let's give Inori
some space to settle in.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,541
Sorry if we bugged you, Inori.

51
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,708
Yeah, my bad.
Welcome to our class.

52
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,875
It's obvious. This is just
too much of a coincidence.

53
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,541
I know the reason she's here has
got something to do with me.

54
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,916
One, two, three, four.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,666
It doesn't seem real
that she's here.

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,750
Like that's actually
a doll or something.

57
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:36,000
Huh? Oh, yeah. I guess
that's kind of true.

58
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,333
It's like she's some
kind of CG creation, huh?

59
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,333
What's wrong with you, Shu?

60
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:45,083
She is not CG, you moron!
She is a real person!

61
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,000
A real person with
real human feelings!

62
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,625
And I'll kick your ass
if you ever hurt them!

63
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:59,000
He called me a moron. Why
doesn't anyone seem to notice

64
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,541
I have real feelings, too?
And now I've managed

65
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:07,208
to turn this into another reason
to feel sorry for myself.

66
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,541
From now on, I'm just
going to do everything

67
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,291
I can to avoid her.

68
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:31,375
Inori? What are?
Where'd these boxes come from?

69
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,625
Hey, wait! Inori!

70
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:42,750
That was rude. What'd you
do that for? Hey! Hang on!

71
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,500
Hey, stop! I wasn't looking!

72
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:04,333
Why are you in my apartment? And
how can you open the front door?

73
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,041
Funell unlocked it for me.

74
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,958
Um, can you please explain
what's going on here?

75
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,458
Drop the manners.

76
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,083
Well, I don't want
to be rude, it's just I--

77
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,291
It's just what?

78
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,666
Oh! Um.

79
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,708
You know, I haven't eaten.

80
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:30,958
Kay.

81
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,375
So, what are you
in the mood for?

82
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,583
Rice balls.

83
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,500
Let's get right to it,
Keido. How do you plan

84
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:43,833
to rectify the events
perpetrated yesterday?

85
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,500
Rest easy, sir. I'm putting
Major Segai in command

86
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,416
of all Funeral Parlor
related matters from here on.

87
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,458
Segai?

88
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,416
Doesn't ring any bells.

89
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,083
But I imagine that you
have heard of "Norma Gene"?

90
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,208
It's a genetic narcotic
that's been on the rise

91
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,958
among civilians. Mostly
teens. Am I right, Dr. Ouma?

92
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,250
Yes. It was an inadvertent
creation during the development

93
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,333
of the Apocalypse
Virus vaccine.

94
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,625
I assigned Segai
to track its distribution

95
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,041
channels and he
gave me an exact

96
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,250
analysis of the countrywide
operation within days.

97
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,875
So you're saying he's sharp?

98
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,541
As a guillotine,

99
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,041
he's a relentless hunter.
Any prey we give him will

100
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,291
have little chance of escape.
Trust me. He's ruthless.

101
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,333
Sorry 'bout that. It was
an urgent work email.

102
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,333
So, you were just about
to say something.

103
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,333
Oh, wait! We still haven't given
you the proper motivation

104
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:41,583
to speak up, have we?
Well let's see what we can do.

105
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,583
This is shaping up to be
a real problem. How am I

106
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,333
going to explain this to
my mom when she gets home?

107
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,625
Right. Haruka Ouma. Senior
Researcher at Sephira Genomics.

108
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,625
Only comes home
about once a week.

109
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,166
Unlikely to be back
for several days.

110
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,500
Why am I surprised that you've
run a background check on me?

111
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,583
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,708
I know this is strange,
but I don't mean to be a burden.

113
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:16,416
It's um-- you're not a burden.
It's just that I don't really

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,916
understand what it is
you're doing here?

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,041
I'm here so I can protect you.

116
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:26,541
Yeah! Coming!

117
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,750
Hey! Hope it's not too late.

118
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,625
No, what's going on?

119
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,750
I happened to be in the
neighborhood and I thought you

120
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,125
might want to watch that movie
I told you about? You down?

121
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Oh. That's really nice.
You seriously came

122
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,541
all the way here
to watch a movie?

123
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,083
Well really to hang out.
You seemed a little weird today.

124
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,625
So I figured I'd check on you.
Did anything happen yesterday?

125
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,166
That's kind of a tough
question. With a tough answer.

126
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,791
I thought so. Huh?
What is she doing here?

127
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,875
I got a communication. I need
you to come with me. Now.

128
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:13,416
There is an explanation for
this, but it's complicated.

129
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,041
How complicated?

130
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,916
Dude. I can't even tell you.
Anyway. I'll see you later.

131
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,583
I want to hear all the details!

132
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,041
All right! Bye!

133
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:33,083
Would you say that Yahiro
Samukawa's your friend?

134
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:35,666
I guess he is. Sure.

135
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,750
He's a really good person.
He takes the time to think

136
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,291
about the people around him.
Not just about himself.

137
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,083
The exact opposite of me.

138
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,125
You've got friends,
right? Don't you?

139
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:56,083
Is it really necessary? Does
a person need to have friends?

140
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:01,375
Yeah. I just finished up.
OAU's quite intrigued.

141
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,333
Although, they did
have one condition.

142
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,375
I'll give you
a detailed report later.

143
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,708
I appreciate you coming.

144
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:14,041
Uh, that's some outfit
you've got on.

145
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,791
Not how most people
picture a terrorist.

146
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,333
Well there's more
to changing the world

147
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,041
than just running around
firing off guns, you know.

148
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,916
Tsugumi, were they tailed?

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,375
All clear from what I can tell.

150
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,166
You owe me an explanation.
Why did you send Inori

151
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,041
to keep an eye on me?

152
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,458
Because we have a problem.
Someone saw us yesterday.

153
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,750
They witnessed the entire
battle and your part in it.

154
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,500
I could've handled them
if they were from the fort.

155
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:42,250
But it seems that
they're an outsider.

156
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,208
More specifically, they're a
student from your high school.

157
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,041
Wait, from my school?
Are you sure?

158
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,583
Have you heard of something
called Norma Gene?

159
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,666
Yeah, I've heard of it,
it's some new drug, right?

160
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,250
Whoa! They were there
for a drug deal?

161
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,333
Our intel reports that they
referred to themselves

162
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:03,333
as Sugar. But I'm guessing
that's just an alias.

163
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,250
We're not certain, but
there's a high likelihood

164
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,458
they saw you and Inori.
You need to locate them.

165
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,541
You're joking.
Do you even realize

166
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,000
how many students there
are who go to my school?

167
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,666
There's no way
we can find them!

168
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,125
Yes. There is. You just have
to draw out their void.

169
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,875
You see them. Is that it?
You can see the Voids.

170
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,041
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

171
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,583
Oh?

172
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,000
How else would you have known
about the Kaleidoscope Void?

173
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:34,041
You can see them;
you just can't pull them out.

174
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,333
My. Rather helpful
that you're quick.

175
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,583
You're right I can
identify Voids.

176
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,666
And while we were
engaged with the enemy,

177
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,291
I felt another presence. More
importantly, I saw their Void.

178
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,916
Thanks to GHQ and their
Temporary Disaster Law,

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,458
terrorists have no human rights.
You'll be in the crosshairs

180
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,125
of every Anti Body in Japan
if this witness identifies you.

181
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,208
Understand?

182
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:01,083
I've already described
the Void's shape to Inori.

183
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,083
If you want to maintain
your peaceful existence,

184
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,000
then you'd better get started.

185
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,666
Are you sure?

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,375
Yeah, I know I can do this.
Don't worry about it.

187
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,250
You memorized them, right?
The Void rules?

188
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,791
Rule one. "Voids
can only be drawn

189
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,375
from people seventeen
years or younger".

190
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:30,583
No one knows why or they're
keeping it a secret from me.

191
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,125
Number two. "When you extract
a void, the vessel loses

192
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,083
all their memories of the
period surrounding the event".

193
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,041
I guess that happens due to
the mental shock of the

194
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,416
intron memory
field being released.

195
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,083
Or something like that.

196
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,583
And that one works in my favor.

197
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:51,833
Time to get some practice in.
Hare will forgive me even

198
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:56,041
if I screw it up somehow.
At least I hope she will.

199
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,458
Now!

200
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,583
Oh no. This can't
be happening to me.

201
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:14,458
Holy crap!

202
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,958
He just dove right in!

203
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,333
Oh, how could you, Shu?
You could have at least

204
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,333
told me if that's
all you wanted.

205
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,541
Shu.

206
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,041
You get back here, Shu Ouma!

207
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,458
I'm done for.
There goes every effort

208
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:39,208
I've made to quietly
blend in. Maybe everyone

209
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:42,708
will just forget? But
probably not until I'm dead.

210
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,291
I don't get how I screwed it up.

211
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,541
Probably the eye contact.

212
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,708
The what?

213
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,583
You weren't making
eye contact with her.

214
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,291
But that's crucial
when drawing out a void.

215
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,458
Wait is that another rule?

216
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,416
Well that one's not
going to work for me.

217
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,208
I get nervous when I make
eye contact with people.

218
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,041
I get self-conscious and
I forget what I'm saying.

219
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,083
Shu?

220
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:14,833
Tell me.

221
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,583
What?

222
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:20,458
Does it look like
I'm looking into your eyes?

223
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:24,500
I'm actually staring
at the spot between them.

224
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,125
The important thing
is that they think

225
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:30,041
you're making eye contact.
That's what Gai told me.

226
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,708
This time it's going to work!

227
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,625
Souta!

228
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,750
What're you doing, Shu?

229
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,291
Just forget this ever happened!

230
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,625
Is that it?

231
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,708
Nope.

232
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah, I uh, had
a feeling it wasn't.

233
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,375
But I've got the hang
of it now. All right then.

234
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,291
It's time to get serious.

235
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,166
Let's do this!

236
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,041
Excuse me!

237
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,875
Not it.

238
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,166
Pardon me for a minute!

239
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,958
That's still not it.

240
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:50,333
Excuse me! Sorry about this!
Really, I'm sorry! What the--?

241
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,875
Holy!

242
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,833
Okay. Can you
at least tell me what

243
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:03,875
Void I'm trying to find here?

244
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:04,958
Shears.

245
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,333
Like garden shears?

246
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,916
Kind of. You'll know
when you see them.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,833
What are Voids anyway? Why do
they all have different shapes?

248
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,791
The physical form that a Void
takes on is a reflection

249
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,708
of that person's inner
fears or complexes.

250
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,250
It's like, well the
shape of their heart.

251
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:25,208
So you mean it's who they are?
Like their essence.

252
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:35,500
Wait, so,why is your Void?
You know, a sword?

253
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:38,791
Found you!

254
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,958
I've got you, Shu!

255
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,125
Uh oh.

256
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,125
Shu!

257
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,458
Come on, this way!

258
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,916
Quit running away!

259
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:00,875
I'm exhausted. Feels like I've
been running for a solid day.

260
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,583
Good thing you
didn't join Funeral Parlor

261
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,250
if you're not
a fan of running.

262
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,833
Good point.

263
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:12,375
How does this sound? We'll
chill here while the class rep

264
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:17,166
calms down and then
you can apologize to her.

265
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,000
Sure. But I don't know if
she's going to forgive me.

266
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,666
She's more likely to stab
me with a pair of shears.

267
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,041
Oh yeah? Sounds like you
watched that movie last night.

268
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,291
It's kind of surprising,
you know. How much

269
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,833
you're into all those
gory slasher flicks.

270
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:37,041
You say that like
it's weird or something.

271
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,666
No, you just don't seem
like you would be.

272
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,291
I guess all I'm saying
is that appearances

273
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,625
can be pretty deceiving
sometimes. Sugar.

274
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:06,041
So you did see me!
And now you're mocking me.

275
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,208
No. That's not what
I was trying to say.

276
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,833
Look, I'm sure you had
a reason. You wouldn't just--

277
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,625
Shut up!

278
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,666
It's too late to act like the
concerned friend! The minute

279
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,875
you called me "Sugar," I knew
you were going to turn me in,

280
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:23,583
so why keep pretending? Just
drop the sanctimonious crap!

281
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:26,416
You and everyone else think
I'm some harmless loser.

282
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,333
Like you just get to decide
what kind of person I am!

283
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,125
And then I have to
act that way because

284
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,833
that's how everyone treats me!
This is the real me, Shu!

285
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,125
Stop it!

286
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:50,500
Oh no. It was his Void.

287
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,000
You've found him.

288
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:59,208
No! You can't just shoot him.

289
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,958
And why not? His temptations
prove how weak he is.

290
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,375
He's too much of a threat to
us to let him live. Trust me.

291
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,583
What the hell do
you guys know about him?

292
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,708
What do you mean?

293
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,666
I know this sounds
stupid but still,

294
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,125
I can't just forget
about the person

295
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,083
that I've always known him
to be. I refuse to believe

296
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:24,000
that it was all a lie! Now put
down that damn gun, Inori!

297
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,208
All right, if that's
how you feel.

298
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,083
Thank you.

299
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,000
Afterward, when Yahiro
finally came to.

300
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,583
We made a pact with each
other. He promised not

301
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,916
to tell anyone about me.
About Funeral Parlor.

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,416
And I promised not to tell
anyone about Norma Gene.

303
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Oddly enough, I felt like
it was the first time

304
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,791
we really met each other.

305
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,833
We've got a report from
Inori. "The witness has been

306
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,625
properly dealt with. Further
intervention is unnecessary".

307
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,041
Really?

308
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,083
Is that okay?

309
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,166
They're free to do
as they see fit.

310
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,125
Shu. Do you think
I can stay with you?

311
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:38,041
It's just that I want to be
part of your life. That's all.

312
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,791
I guess you can do that
if that's what you want.

313
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,000
What's going on?

314
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:54,708
Hey, what's the deal?

315
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,208
GHQ?

316
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,375
I'm sorry about this.

317
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,541
Sorry about what?

318
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,625
No, what did you tell them?
Yahiro! What did you do?

319
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,708
Hello, Shu Ouma.

320
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,916
You, my friend,
are under arrest.
