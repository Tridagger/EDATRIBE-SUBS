1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,730
You tricked us, didn't you?

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,350
Not necessarily.

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,990
I did make it perfectly clear.
I wanted you to become a magical girls.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,940
I just didn't explain the exact form
you'd be taking to do, that is all.

5
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,390
Why wouldn't you tell us something like that?

6
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,110
Because you never asked.

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,310
Besides, even if you never found out,
it wouldn't bother you one bit.

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,750
In fact, Mami never found out, even at the end.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,330
You humans don't even realize you have souls.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,220
They're not something you can
physically feel inside you.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,080
Your bodies are such fragile containers.

12
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,140
Just a cluster of neurons,
organs and the circulatory system.

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,020
It's an amazing construction.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,550
But once your bodies stop functioning,
your soul disappears.

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,660
To keep that from happening,
I put your soul into a physical form.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,290
It makes the soul easier to protect,
and easier to keep track of.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,840
That way, you can battle witches
and not have to worry about it.

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,890
Well, nobody asked you to do that, did they?

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,920
You still don't understand
the dangers of combat, do you?

20
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,950
Ugh...

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,370
Let's say you've been impaled by a spear.

22
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,300
Do you know how much stimulus would
register in your pain receptors?

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,990
Argh!

24
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,070
That is what it would feel like.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,580
One strike, and you're completely incapacitated.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,170
The reason you stayed standing
during the fight with Kyoko

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,230
is because you were spared the
pain your body was experiencing.

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,420
And that was possible because your soul
and body weren't directly connected.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,870
You were able to survive that
fight because of your modification.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,180
Once you get used to it,
you figure out how to block out all the pain.

31
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,000
There's a downside though.

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,660
Your reaction time suffers.

33
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,310
So, I don't recommend it.

34
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,730
How could you do this to us?

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,220
Why?

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,110
You did accept the destiny of fighting witches,

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,220
provided I grant one wish for you.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,050
That wish has come true, hasn't it?

39
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,800
Stand.

40
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,710
Bow.

41
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,000
You knew about this, didn't you?

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,590
How come you didn't tell us about it before?

43
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,260
Would you believe me if I did?

44
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,630
I tried telling others before, but no one ever does.

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,300
But why would Kyubey do something so cruel to us?

46
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,730
Because it doesn't think what it did was cruel.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,640
That creature doesn't understand human values.

48
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,380
A soul's a fair exchange for granting someone's wish.

49
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,180
That's what it thinks anyway.

50
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,380
But there's nothing fair about it!

51
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,550
What he did to her isn't right!

52
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,470
All Sayaka wanted was to help someone she
loves, to help him get better again.

53
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,510
An agreement is still an agreement.

54
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,850
It made the impossible possible, didn't it?

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,860
That boy would've never gotten better,
no matter what,

56
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,850
even if Sayaka Miki spent the rest
of her life taking care of him.

57
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,630
The truth is, a miracle like that
is worth more than a life of human.

58
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,420
That's the price it sells them for.

59
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,390
Does that mean Sayaka can't go back to her normal life?

60
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,100
I already told you once.

61
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,980
You really should forget about Sayaka Miki.

62
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,590
But she's my friend and she saved my life!

63
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:57,830
If Sayaka hadn't become a magical girl,
Hitomi and I would both be dead right now.

64
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,660
Don't confuse gratitude with responsibility.

65
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,290
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

66
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,630
And if you're trying to repay
her to ease your guilt, don't.

67
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,470
That's arrogant thinking, and you should stop it.

68
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,590
Why do you always act so cold?

69
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,470
Well...

70
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,340
Maybe I behave this way because I'm not human anymore.

71
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,530
How could I ever face Kyosuke again?

72
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,650
Now that I've been turned into this thing.

73
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Huh?

74
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,680
What happened to us sucks.

75
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,800
I bet you regret ever making that contract, don't ya?

76
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,730
But you know, me, I think I'm okay with it.

77
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,340
I mean, I can do whatever I want with my powers.

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Who cares about the details?

79
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,160
I don't really think it's a deal breaker, you know.

80
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,020
You think you got what you pay for, huh?

81
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,310
Oh, yeah, I did.

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,020
That's a great way to look at it.

83
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,140
Think about it. If you live for
yourself, you only got yourself to blame.

84
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,640
So I can't really blame anyone
else and I don't have any regrets.

85
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:32,910
See?

86
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,320
If you look at it that way,
you won't beat yourself up about it.

87
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,950
You brought me all the way out here, just to talk?

88
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,990
Uh-huh.

89
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,280
Got a lot to talk about.

90
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,120
You want one?

91
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
Ugh...

92
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,030
I see you wasting food like that again, I will kill you.

93
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,820
Ugh...

94
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,820
Uh...

95
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,290
Wanna know where we are?

96
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,250
It's my dad's church.

97
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,010
He was an honest man and way too nice.

98
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,940
He's the kind of guy who'd read
the papers and start tearing up,

99
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,640
'cause he couldn't figure out how to make things better.

100
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,350
He thought religion hadn't adapted enough.

101
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,580
He wanted something new,
something that made sense in today's world.

102
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,380
So one day, he started preaching stuff to
the congregation that wasn't in the Bible.

103
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,170
People got upset, stopped coming to his sermons.

104
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,330
The church kicked him out, and after that,

105
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,310
well, nobody cared about what he had to say.

106
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,010
Heh, go figure, right?

107
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,190
I mean, from the outside,
I bet he looked like he was trying to start a cult.

108
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,660
Didn't matter if what he said was
right or even if it made any sense.

109
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,580
Everyone treated him like he was a psycho.

110
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,410
It got so bad for my family that there were
lots of times where we didn't have any food.

111
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,370
I couldn't understand it.

112
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,110
My dad wasn't doing or saying anything wrong.

113
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,570
It was just different from what
everyone was used to hearing, is all.

114
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,560
If people would've just calmed down,

115
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,870
gave him five minutes and really
listened to what he had to say,

116
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,040
they would've seen he was right.

117
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,170
Yeah, but...

118
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,310
in the end, nobody did.

119
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,470
I got mad, like really pissed off.

120
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,100
I hated that nobody gave my dad a chance and
tried to understand what he was talking about.

121
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,880
Then, Kyubey showed up and I made my wish.

122
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,500
I wanted everyone to listen to my dad and
take the stuff he was saying seriously.

123
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,300
The next morning, they came back.

124
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,920
The church was packed with so many people.

125
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,870
Everyday, there was more and more
people coming to hear my dad preach.

126
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,380
And me, I started doing the magical girl thing.

127
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,270
I figured, no matter how awesome my dad's sermons were,

128
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,590
they weren't gonna take care
of the witches any time soon.

129
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,730
It was my job, so like an idiot,

130
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,040
I threw myself at hunting witches full time.

131
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,700
We were gonna save the world together,

132
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,590
him doing it out in the open and me in the shadows.

133
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,980
And one day, my dad found out
about what was really going on.

134
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,660
Man, I'll never forget it.

135
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,950
When he realized everyone was there,
not because of what he was preaching,

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,550
but because of my magic, he totally lost it.

137
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,370
And then he called me, his own daughter,
an evil witch who corrupted his flock.

138
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,210
Heh, isn't that hilarious?

139
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm the one out every night hunting
real witches and he calls me a witch!

140
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,280
After that, my dad had a breakdown.

141
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,110
He got really depressed.

142
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,800
He was drinking a lot and then he went crazy.

143
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:34,630
He killed my family and then he committed
suicide, leaving me behind...

144
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,590
alone.

145
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,790
The thing I wished for destroyed my whole family.

146
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,220
I brought all this suffering down on my family

147
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,910
'cause I made a wish for my dad,
without knowing what he really wanted.

148
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,850
So right then and there,

149
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,390
I promised myself I'd never use
magic to help anyone else ever again.

150
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,480
This power is mine, and I'll use it for me and me alone.

151
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,530
Miracles aren't free, you know?

152
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,190
If you wished for something good to happen,

153
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,400
a whole lot of bad stuff's gonna happen, too.

154
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,250
I guess that's how the world stays in balance.

155
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,740
Good, bad, everything zeroes out.

156
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,890
Why are you telling me all this stuff for?

157
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,190
'Cause I want you to stop
caring and do what you wanna do.

158
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,280
Hey, you got what you pay for, didn't ya?

159
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
I'm a little confused.

160
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,860
You just got done telling me all
about how you're in this for yourself.

161
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,130
Why are you worrying about me all of a sudden?

162
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,400
'Cause you and me,
we both made the same mistake, didn't we?

163
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,090
You gotta stop feeling the way you do
'cause it'll only bring you more pain.

164
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,140
You already paid your dues,
way more than what you got for 'em.

165
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,120
Know what I think?

166
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,250
You take what you got and figure
out how to get something out of it.

167
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,740
Kinda like how you do?

168
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,530
Exactly how I do.

169
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,170
Look, I figured out how things
work and wanna save you some grief.

170
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,320
I can't stand seeing you go through this.

171
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,440
I had the wrong idea about you from the beginning.

172
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,650
I'm sorry about that.

173
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,980
So, forgive me.

174
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,770
But still, I don't have any regrets
about using my wish for someone else.

175
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,000
And I've decided that from now
on, I'm not gonna regret anything,

176
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,440
ever again.

177
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,540
Why are you being so stubborn?

178
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,090
Honestly, I don't think I paid
too big a price for what I got.

179
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,090
I think magic can be used for great things,
depending on how you use it.

180
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,160
Which reminds me...

181
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,790
those apples.

182
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,960
How did you get them, huh?

183
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,520
Mind telling me where you got the money for them?

184
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,260
...Ugh...

185
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,180
Hmpf.

186
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,180
Yeah, thought so.

187
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,010
In that case, I can't eat those apples.

188
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm not gonna have any part of them.

189
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,070
You idiot!

190
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,420
We're magical girls!

191
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,880
There's no one like us!

192
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,690
Nobody can do what we do!

193
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,840
I'll do things my way,

194
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,530
and fight my own battles.

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,490
If you don't like it, then you can come
find me and try to kill me if you want.

196
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,730
I won't hate you for it.

197
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,790
But I won't lose to you either.

198
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,350
Tsk...

199
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,440
Good morning, Sayaka!

200
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,290
Wait up!

201
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,490
Ah...

202
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,650
Good morning, Sayaka. How are you?

203
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,590
H-hey.

204
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
Good morning.

205
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,700
Why didn't you come to school yesterday?

206
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,790
Oh, um, I felt a little sick, is all.

207
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,230
But, Sayaka...

208
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,600
Mm.

209
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,100
Hey, I got an idea.

210
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,340
How about we go and...

211
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,100
Oh...

212
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,900
I didn't know Kyosuke was out of the hospital.

213
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,610
Hey, Kyosuke.

214
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,970
You're okay to be back here?

215
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,930
Yeah.

216
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,680
If I stayed home,
it wouldn't help get my legs back in shape.

217
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,410
I'm hoping to get off these crutches
and be walking on my own by next week.

218
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,370
I'm glad Kyosuke is doing better.

219
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,810
Mm-hm.

220
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,140
You haven't talked him yet, have you?

221
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,300
Why don't you go over and say hi to him?

222
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,970
No, it's okay.

223
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,180
Maybe later.

224
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,490
Uh...

225
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,340
Okay...

226
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,470
Whatcha wanna talk about?

227
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,590
I wanna talk about love.

228
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,260
I'll explain it.

229
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,580
There's something I haven't told you or Madoka.

230
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,540
But I can't stay silent any longer.

231
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,430
Huh?

232
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,820
Oh, okay.

233
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,300
For a long time now, I...

234
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,920
I've always liked Kyosuke Kamijo.

235
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,370
And I'm in love with him.

236
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,870
O-oh, you are, huh?

237
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,300
I-I never would've guessed, Hitomi.

238
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,500
Th-That's awesome.

239
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,090
I hope Kyosuke knows just how lucky he is.

240
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,020
You've known Kyosuke for a while.

241
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,710
Weren't you friends since childhood?

242
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,220
Oh, yeah, sort of.

243
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,590
We hang out together every now and then.

244
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,040
And it's nothing more than that?

245
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,270
I've got long and hard about this.

246
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,530
I can't lie to myself any longer.

247
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,090
So, how about you?

248
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,760
I need to know, can you face your
true feelings for him, Sayaka?

249
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,490
Uh, true feelings?

250
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,610
What do you mean?

251
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,390
I take my friendship with you very seriously.

252
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:23,550
And I don't wanna get into a situation where
you think I'm stealing him away from you.

253
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,870
I wanna respect the relationship you have with Kyosuke,

254
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,120
because you've known him a lot longer than I have.

255
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,970
That's why if you like him,
you have a right to go after him before I do.

256
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Hitomi...

257
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,840
I'm going to tell Kyosuke how
I feel after school tomorrow.

258
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,150
That gives you one day to decide.

259
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,520
Will you confess your true feelings to him or won't you?

260
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,180
Think about what you want so you
don't have any regrets later.

261
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,430
I...

262
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,510
I just...I...

263
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,520
Madoka...

264
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,560
Is it okay if I come along?

265
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,250
I won't get in the way.

266
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,100
I just don't want you to be all alone.

267
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,380
Can I come?

268
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,530
Why?

269
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,100
Why are you always so nice to me?

270
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,330
I don't deserve having a friend like you...

271
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,540
What?

272
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,700
I started to have...second thoughts today.

273
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,850
Uh...

274
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,970
I thought...what if I hadn't saved Hitomi.

275
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,670
It was just for a second, but still...

276
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,040
I guess I'm not a hero after all.

277
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,860
What would Mami think if she was still here?

278
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,190
I'm going to lose Kyosuke to Hitomi.

279
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,690
And there's nothing I can do about it now.

280
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,430
Because I'm...

281
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,150
I'm already dead!

282
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,390
I'm a zombie...!

283
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,240
I can't ask him to hold me if I'm like this!

284
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,250
I can't ever ask him to kiss me..!

285
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,680
I feel better now...

286
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,170
I'm sorry...

287
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,780
You don't have to be....

288
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm okay.

289
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,390
Thanks for listening, Madoka.

290
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,790
Come on, let's go!

291
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,220
We've got some witches that need beating down!

292
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,390
Right.

293
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,950
You are the last person I'd
expect to just sit and watch.

294
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,250
Tonight's the real deal.

295
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,250
She's fighting a witch, not a familiar.

296
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,610
If she beats it, she'll get a Grief Seed.

297
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,320
So at least she's fighting for something.

298
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:28,330
I'm surprised you give up your prey so
easy, just to help her out.

299
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,870
What the hell is she doing?

300
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,840
She's gonna get herself killed!

301
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,080
Hahh!

302
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,080
Sayaka!

303
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,470
Geez.

304
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,150
I can't watch this any more.

305
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,660
Hang out here, okay?

306
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,460
Let me show you a couple of basic moves.

307
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,480
Hey!

308
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,840
I can do this alone.

309
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,150
Get out of my way.

310
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,130
Sayaka!

311
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,480
Ha ha ha...

312
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,440
What's going on with her?!

313
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,670
Ha ha ha.

314
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,370
It's true!

315
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,360
I can block out the pain!

316
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,970
Ha ha ha!

317
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,390
I don't feel any pain anymore!

318
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,170
Stop...

319
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,360
Please...

320
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,820
stop...

321
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,420
I'm gonna be a different kind of magical girl.

322
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,120
That's what I decided.

323
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,240
I don't need anyone's thanks.

324
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,470
I'll be the only magical girl around
who doesn't use her magic for herself.

325
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,920
I was stupid...

326
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,350
so stupid.

327
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,130
<i>Hey, dummy.</i>

328
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,010
<i>How much long are you gonna stay inside?</i>

329
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,760
<i>Can you come out for a sec?</i>

330
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,800
<i>I wanna talk.</i>

331
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,730
<i>It's cool.</i>

332
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,710
<i>I feel fine.</i>

333
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,370
<i>You don't have to worry about a thing.</i>
