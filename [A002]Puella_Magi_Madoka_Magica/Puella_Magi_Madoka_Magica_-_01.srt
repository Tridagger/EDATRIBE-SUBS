1
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,960
That's horrible...

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,020
You can't help it.

3
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,390
One person can't handle this alone.

4
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,050
But she knew that and came here anyway.

5
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,710
No, this isn't right, it's too much for her...

6
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,830
If she gives up, it's over.

7
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,390
But, you have the power to change this destiny.

8
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,520
All this tragedy, all this destruction,
you can change it, if you want.

9
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,200
The power to do so lies within you.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,350
I can change it?

11
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,670
Even someone like me can do something to help?

12
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,980
Can I really change how this ends?

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,980
Of course, you can.

14
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,300
Just make a contract with me, and become a Magical Girl!

15
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,950
That was a crazy dream...

16
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,240
<OP>

17
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,170
Good morning, Dad.

18
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,030
Oh, good morning, Madoka.

19
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,490
Mom up yet?

20
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,860
Tatsuya's waking her up.

21
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,360
He might need some help, though.

22
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,350
Okay.

23
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,530
Mama, mama!

24
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,570
Wake up, wake up!

25
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,120
C'mon, mama!

26
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,690
Mama, mama!

27
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,390
Rise and shine!!

28
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,830
Urghhhhhhhh!!

29
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,710
......What the...?

30
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Mama woke up, yay!

31
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,440
What's happening in your world?

32
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,730
Well, Hitomi got another love letter.

33
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,590
It's the second one this month.

34
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,390
Huh, if he can't say to her face, he's not worth it.

35
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,640
How's Kazuko doing?

36
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,610
I think her new boyfriend's working out.

37
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,520
She can't seem to talk about
anything else during homeroom.

38
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,000
This week's their three months
anniversary, so I guess that's the record.

39
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,840
Oh I hope they can make it.

40
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,530
They're at a critical stage in their relationship.

41
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,430
They are?

42
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,210
If it's not the real thing,
this is usually when it starts to fall apart.

43
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,830
But if they made it this far,
they should be okay for another year.

44
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,780
Oh...

45
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
I look fabulous.

46
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,070
I wonder which ribbon I should wear.

47
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,620
Really?

48
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,830
It's not too flashy?

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,970
There's no such thing as too flashy, hon.

50
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,630
A woman can't afford to get
teased 'cause she looks sloppy.

51
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,060
Hah, perfect!

52
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,030
Your secret admirers are gonna get all wobbly and knees.

53
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,850
I don't have secret admirers.

54
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,910
But you should dress and behave like you do.

55
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,610
That's the secret every pretty girl should know.

56
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,900
Hehe..

57
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,540
Ah...

58
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,540
Uh-oh!

59
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,780
Yay, safe!

60
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,990
Now be good, and eat it all up, okay?

61
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,230
Okay!

62
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,330
Hey honey, some more coffee?

63
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,890
Uh...

64
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,040
I better not.

65
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,230
All right!

66
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm off to work, everyone.

67
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,590
Have a good day, honey.

68
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,620
Bye, mama.

69
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,370
Hey, you're gonna be late if you don't hurry.

70
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,740
Oh yeah.

71
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,580
See you later!

72
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,550
Have a great day!

73
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,870
Have a great day!

74
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,680
Good morning, guys!

75
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,280
Good morning.

76
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,940
What took you so long, Madoka?

77
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,130
Look at you with your cute ribbons.

78
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,100
You think so?

79
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,280
They're not too flashy?

80
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,050
I think they look lovely.

81
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,560
My mom said that if a boy can't say he loves
you to your face, he's not worth your time.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
Your mom is way cool, Madoka!

83
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,900
I mean she's smart, gorgeous and successful.

84
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,230
If only I could make up my mind as easily as that.

85
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,800
If only everyone could have your problems.

86
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,140
You know, she is right.

87
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,060
I wish someone would send me a love letter some time.

88
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,450
It'd be nice to get one.

89
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,160
Ah, now I get it.

90
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,170
You want to be as beautiful and
popular as Hitomi, don't ya?

91
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,450
I bet that's why you're wearing
those ribbons to change your image.

92
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,390
That's not true!

93
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,850
My mom picked these out and...

94
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,210
You tricked your mom to tell you the
secret to being popular, didn't you?

95
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,030
I'm not gonna let that happen!

96
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,910
Ha!

97
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,620
No!

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,160
No, stop it!

99
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,150
No!

100
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,700
You're just too cute!

101
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,090
I'm not gonna let you be popular with the boys.

102
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,240
You're mine, Madoka!

103
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,510
Mine, mine, mine.

104
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,380
Ahem.

105
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:02,900
Ahem.

106
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,460
I have a very important issue to discuss today.

107
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,200
So eyes front, ears open!

108
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,150
The correct way to fry an egg is sunny side up or down?

109
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,200
Come on, Nakazawa. I don't have all day.

110
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,970
I... I gue... uh...

111
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,060
You can fry either way, can't you?

112
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,200
Yes, precisely.

113
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,830
You can fry either way!

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,460
Therefore, go through without saying that you should never
judge a women's beauty by the way she fries her eggs.

115
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,470
Remember, girls, do not associate with men who
refuse to eat eggs that's been fried sunny side down.

116
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,340
I guess it didn't work out.

117
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,760
But what gave you that idea?

118
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,960
And you boys, better make sure you don't grow up to be men who
complain about how the damn eggs are cooked, understand?!

119
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,230
Well, now that that's out of the way,
let's give a big warm welcome to our new classmate!

120
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,580
Uh, maybe that should've come first?

121
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,920
Come in, Miss Akemi.

122
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,030
Don't be shy!

123
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,140
Wow!

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,280
Wow, she's super gorgeous.

125
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,480
Huh?

126
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,270
No way!

127
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,800
It couldn't be!

128
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,390
Why don't you tell the class
a little bit about yourself?

129
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,450
I'm Homura Akemi.

130
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,900
It's nice to meet you.

131
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,550
Uh...

132
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,660
Um...

133
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,800
Uh, Miss Akemi?

134
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,050
What school did you go to before coming to this one?

135
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,950
I went to a private Catholic school in Tokyo.

136
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,180
Were you in a club?

137
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,230
How about sports?

138
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Were you on any teams?

139
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,930
No, not really.

140
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,790
Your hair is really beautiful!

141
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,130
What kind of shampoo do you like to use?

142
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,730
There's something awfully mysterious
about that girl, don't you think?

143
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,390
Hey, Madoka, do you know that girl?

144
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,730
I could've sworn to you she was glaring
at you when she was in front of the class.

145
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,360
Well, I'm not really sure...

146
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,620
I think today's been a little stressful for me.

148
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,250
I'm not feeling very well.

149
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,600
May I please go to the Nurse's Office?

150
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,560
Ah, sure.

151
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,090
If you want, I can take you over there.

152
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:22,880
Good idea!

153
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,930
Can I come too?

154
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,110
Please don't trouble yourselves.

155
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,310
I'll ask the Nurse's Aide to take me.

156
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,530
Huh?

157
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,670
Miss Madoka Kaname.

158
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,560
You are the Nurse's Aide for this class, are you not?

159
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:39,590
Huh?

160
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,690
Um, well...

161
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,860
I uh...

162
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,490
Would you please come with me?

163
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,090
To the Nurse's Office.

164
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,160
Um, I...was...

165
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,660
H-How did you know I was the Nurse's Aide for the class?

166
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,240
Ms Saotome told me that you were.

167
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,860
Oh, right, of course she did.

168
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,090
By the way, the Nurse's Office is over there.

169
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,650
This way, right?

170
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,360
Huh?

171
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,990
Uh, yeah, that's right.

172
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,720
But, um...

173
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,470
So anyway, how do you know your way there?

174
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,510
I mean you're new here and all.

175
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,160
Um...Miss, um...Akemi?

176
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,610
Call me Homura.

177
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,400
Oh, Homura.

178
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,560
What is it?

179
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,540
Uh, nothing. It's just that...you have an unusual name.

180
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,340
But not in a bad way or anything,
I was just thinking how it sounded cool...

181
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,100
for a first name, I mean.

182
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,290
Madoka Kaname, do you treasure
the life you currently live?

183
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,620
And do you consider your family
and your friends precious?

184
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,080
Oh, well, I uh...

185
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,300
Of course I do.

186
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,050
I mean I-I do.

187
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,940
My family and my friends, I love them very
much and yes they're very precious to me.

188
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,950
Do you mean it?

189
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,110
Absolutely.

190
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,580
I couldn't lie about that!

191
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,440
Good.

192
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,130
Because if that's the truth, then you wouldn't try
changing the life you have or the person you are.

193
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,030
Otherwise, you'd lose everything you love.

194
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,170
Huh?

195
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,460
Don't change.

196
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,310
Stay as you are, Madoka Kaname.

197
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,450
Stay as you are, forever.

198
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,400
Wow...

199
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,690
Wow...

200
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,930
She breaks the record of every school in this city?!

201
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,470
I can't believe you can jump that high!

202
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,600
She said what?!

203
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,610
It doesn't make any sense, does it?

204
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,270
When I was thinking she was this awesome
girl but it turns out she is a total psycho!

205
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,340
Ah! I hope she doesn't think acting
like a weird transfer student is cool.

206
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,420
That's so MOE? It makes me sick!

207
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,730
This has to be misunderstanding.

208
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,830
Are you positive you've never met her before?

209
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:09,890
Hmm...

210
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,220
I guess the sensible answer will be "yes."

211
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,930
Okay, what do you mean by sensible?

212
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,560
Either you met her or you didn't?

213
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,870
Well, it's like...

214
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:22,080
You're gonna think I'm weird but I
first met her in a dream or something.

215
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,250
Hahahaha... That's awesome!

216
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,670
An anime character in you's popping out, too!

217
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,520
This is really bugging me!

218
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,470
I got it all figured out.

219
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,930
You guys knew each other in the past life and the fate is
reached across time and space to bring you back together again.

220
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,590
In your dream, what happened when you met her?

221
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,900
That's the thing. I can't really
remember what happened in it.

222
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,310
All I know is that was really strange and spooky.

223
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,400
If you want my opinion, I think it's entirely
possibly you met Miss Akemi somewhere before.

224
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,250
Huh?!

225
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,470
You might not remember meeting her,
but your subconscious certainly took note of it.

226
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,450
When you were having that dream,
your subconscious simply brought up the image of her.

227
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,550
Seriously?

228
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,740
That's the heck of coincidence, don't you think?

229
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,760
Uh, perhaps.

230
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,560
Uh-oh, look how late it's gotten.

231
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,330
Excuse me, but I really should be going now.

232
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,970
Is it Piano today or classical dance?

233
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,660
Tea Ceremony lessons today.

234
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,490
Even though our Exams are coming up,
my mother still wants me to continue taking them.

235
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,890
Yeah, there's another reason to
be glad I wasn't born a rich girl.

236
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,510
We should get going too.

237
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,160
Madoka, you wanna hit the music store on the way home?

238
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,030
Okay.

239
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,690
Something for Kyosuke again?

240
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,890
Yeah, maybe.

241
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,940
Have fun shopping!

242
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,860
Later!

243
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,040
Is that you?

244
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,060
Help me...

245
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,870
Homura?

246
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,740
Get away from that creature.

247
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,630
B-But he's really hurt.

248
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,200
Leave him alone.

249
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,930
Why are you trying to hurt him?

250
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,190
This doesn't concern you.

251
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,810
But he was calling me!

252
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,570
I could hear him calling my name!

253
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,180
He was asking me to help him!

254
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,120
Really?

255
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,190
Over here, Madoka!

256
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,070
Sayaka!

257
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,850
Why is this happening now?

258
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,900
Now she's attacking you on cosplay?

259
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,080
What's her problem?

260
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,890
And what's that thing you're carrying?

261
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,570
Looks like a stuffed animal. Is it alive?

262
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,880
I don't know.

263
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,220
I don't know why this is
happening, but we have to save him!

264
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,060
Where'd the exit go?

265
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,250
Where are we?

266
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,330
I don't like this place.

267
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,500
Everything keeps changing!

268
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,850
Oh, crap!

269
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,500
What the heck's going on?!

270
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,120
There's something over there!

271
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,980
Is this some kinda joke, right?

272
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,350
I'm stuck in a bad dream, but I am dreaming, right?

273
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,680
Right, Madoka?!

274
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,760
What's happening?

275
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,780
I don't know.

276
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,470
That was close, wasn't it?

277
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,340
But don't worry, you're safe now.

278
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,530
Thank goodness.

279
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,040
You rescued Kyubey for me.

280
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,340
I'm very grateful.

281
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,730
He's a dear friend of mine and I was so worried.

282
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,020
He called out to me.

283
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,370
I could hear his voice inside my head.

284
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,560
Ahh, I see.

285
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,050
I can tell by your uniforms that you
both go to Mitakihara Middle School.

286
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,520
Are you 8th graders?

287
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,650
Who are you?

288
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,640
Oh, that's right.

289
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,300
Maybe I should introduce myself.

290
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,890
Actually, it's going to have to wait a bit.

291
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,420
Please excuse me.

292
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,870
I have to wrap this up first.

293
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,320
Wow, amazing!

294
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,930
We're back!

295
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,490
The witch managed to escape.

296
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,090
If you wanna finish it off, you'd better go after it.

297
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,390
I won't mind if you take it this time.

298
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,890
But I still have work to do here.

299
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,060
You don't understand, do you?

300
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,270
I'm telling you I'm willing to overlook this.

301
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,550
Honestly, don't you think it would be
best if we didn't do this right now?

302
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,380
Thank you, Mami!

303
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,690
You're a lifesaver!

304
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

305
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,630
They saved you.

306
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,180
I was just passing by.

307
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,330
Thank you very much!

308
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,930
My name is Kyubey.

309
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,750
Were you the one who was calling for help?

310
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,430
That's right, Madoka Kaname,

311
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,290
And Sayaka Miki.

312
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,920
Wow, hang on a sec.

313
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,270
How do you know our names?

314
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,060
I came here because I have a favor to ask of you both.

315
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,410
Huh?

316
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,520
What do you mean?

317
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,780
I want you to make contracts
with me,and become magical girls!

318
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,990
I will grant each of you one wish, any wish you desire.

319
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:29,980
Huh?

320
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,840
For reals?

321
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:31,980
Anything at all?

322
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,190
Anything at all.

323
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,730
I can grant the most impossible of miracles!

324
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,910
That would be truly wonderful.

325
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,700
Huh?!

326
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,020
Come on, that's mean!

327
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,790
Bye bye!

328
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:15,990
<i>Help me!</i>

329
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,040
<i>Huh?</i>

330
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,980
<i>Madoka, help me!</i>
