1
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,619
What's up, Yuuko?

2
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,619
I've got zero motivation.

3
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:09,911
You serious right now?

4
00:00:09,994 --> 00:00:12,161
But we like, just started a new semester.

5
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,036
Think of the possibilities.

6
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,244
I'm sure you'll find something that gets you motivated

7
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:17,869
if you get the ball rolling.

8
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:21,411
I can barely roll out of bed, let alone roll a ball.

9
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:25,494
How am I supposed to find the
motivation to be motivated, huh?

10
00:00:25,577 --> 00:00:28,827
A motive for motivation. Hm...

11
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,827
How 'bout you just do it?!

12
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,119
'Kay, sure!

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,494
It must be nice to be a complete idiot.

14
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,661
Hakase! It's about time to get out of bed!

15
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,786
There we go.

16
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:05,369
Morning.

17
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:06,952
Whatcha got there?

18
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,702
It's a fish that I'm grilling
up for this morning's breakfast.

19
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:12,119
Fish? But I want a rice omelet!

20
00:01:12,202 --> 00:01:14,702
But you had that for breakfast yesterday.

21
00:01:14,786 --> 00:01:18,452
Besides, fish are packed with essential vitamins and minerals.

22
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,411
If you wanna grow up to be big and strong,

23
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,036
you need to have a balanced diet.

24
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,411
Uh?

25
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:30,827
Um. Excuse me, do you mind returning our breakfast?

26
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,827
Uh. No, this isn't what it looks like!

27
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:38,577
It's definitely not a robotic component or anything!

28
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,327
You see... It's a...

29
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,494
He's gone!

30
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:48,077
Come back you crazy cat!

31
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,744
Okay, bye...

32
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,952
Come to think of it,

33
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:58,244
what if the cat needs that food more than we do?

34
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:05,827
Ahh! Look out!

35
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:09,869
Hi, good to see ya, Mio! <i>Selamat pagi</i> !

36
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,327
Oh, hi, Yuuko. It's nice to see you too.

37
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:14,786
You think it's okay if I don't have my student ID?

38
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:16,286
'Cause I forgot it today.

39
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,661
Wait, did she miss that I greeted her in Malay?

40
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:21,827
I hope some upperclassman doesn't notice and call me out.

41
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,536
If one does, you can just say you're an upperclassman too,

42
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,827
and they'll have no idea without your ID.

43
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,202
That won't solve anything. I guarantee you.

44
00:04:30,619 --> 00:04:33,119
That sounded like thunder, but the sky's so clear.

45
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,244
It might start pouring any second!

46
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,286
It'd suck if we got rained on outta nowhere!

47
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,786
It's raining wooden dolls.

48
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,786
Whoa! Are you all right?

49
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:47,119
How does that fall from the sky?

50
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,869
Yeah, that's super weird.
I wonder where it even came from.

51
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:51,911
I'm just as confused as you are.

52
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,411
But don't worry, I bet something as crazy as this

53
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,619
only happens once in a girl's lifetime.

54
00:04:56,702 --> 00:04:59,286
You know. It's like a freak accident. Right?

55
00:04:59,369 --> 00:05:00,577
Yeah, totally.

56
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,952
That must mean I'm lucky.

57
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,786
I'm not lucky at all.

58
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:09,994
You doin' okay down there?

59
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,619
It happened again with a red cow this time.

60
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:15,202
What does it mean?

61
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:17,452
Y'know, maybe it's not about luck at all.

62
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:20,119
Sometimes, bad things happen, but it could be worse.

63
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:21,619
At least I wasn't hit by something

64
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:23,952
that's disgusting like raw meat. So, as long as that

65
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:26,119
doesn't happen, it's really not that ba--

66
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,994
It's raw salmon!

67
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:44,911
Good morning!

68
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,244
Oh, heyo!

69
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:51,619
Morning!

70
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:53,369
Good morning to you.

71
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:58,494
Oh, hey. Good morning, Mai.

72
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:00,452
<i>Selamat pagi</i> !

73
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:01,619
Good morning.

74
00:06:01,702 --> 00:06:03,869
That looks interesting, whatcha got there?

75
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:05,952
This is a real estate magazine.

76
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,869
Wha--? Are you lookin' to buy a house?

77
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,536
Undecided.

78
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,994
My awesome, unique greeting gets ignored yet again.

79
00:06:14,077 --> 00:06:16,077
Oh, well. I guess I have no choice

80
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:18,786
but to put this short-lived phrase to rest.

81
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:19,619
Yuuko.

82
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,286
Huh?

83
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,952
<i>Selamat malam.</i>

84
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:32,202
Silly Mai! It's <i>"selamat pagi"</i> ! Ha!

85
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:35,036
What language are they speaking?

86
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,827
It's, uh, time for homeroom. Take your seats.

87
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,286
Okay, when I arrived at school today,

88
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,077
I found this inside my shoe locker.

89
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:49,702
Now, did one of you kids put it in there?

90
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:56,536
Um, well, uh. If you did do it, that's okay.

91
00:06:56,619 --> 00:06:58,952
I would just appreciate if you'd own up to it.

92
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,036
Who do you think could've pulled that kind of prank?

93
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,327
It's pretty bonkers, huh?

94
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,077
How am I supposed to know?

95
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,827
I bet you it was a student that has like,

96
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:07,577
a big crush on her or something.

97
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,827
But who would give their crush a Buddha statue?

98
00:07:09,911 --> 00:07:12,286
Although, I can definitely understand the feeling

99
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,161
of wanting to give the person you like a gift,

100
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:16,327
so I can't really blame 'em.

101
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:18,661
Oh, that's right. It's because you have a crush

102
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,744
on that upperclassman Koujirou Sasahara.

103
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:23,161
Ah! Don't say it out loud!

104
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:30,369
Where am I? How did I get here?

105
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:35,202
Huh?

106
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,952
I have to get home.

107
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:49,202
Hakase is probably worried sick.

108
00:07:49,286 --> 00:07:52,786
Plus, I left the grill on, and that's a hazard.

109
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:05,994
Oh, no. I can't get down!

110
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:08,036
Wait. My chopsticks are gone.

111
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:11,077
And I'm missing a slipper!

112
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:14,577
What do I do?

113
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,786
My hand's gone, too!

114
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,661
Ohh! Now it'll be obvious that I'm a robot!

115
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:29,286
Ready?

116
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,286
Thanks for the meal.

117
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,369
Hm? Hurry.

118
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:55,911
You gotta finish eating your
food before fifth period starts.

119
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,619
Wait, all you've got left is one sausage.

120
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:03,286
This is all part of my plan to save the very best

121
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,327
of my lunch for the grand finale.

122
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:06,702
That way, I'm for sure gonna walk away

123
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:08,869
from my meal satisfied.

124
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:10,077
Hmm...

125
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,911
And now, without further ado,

126
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,911
it's gonna go down the hatch!

127
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:45,952
Oh!

128
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:52,286
It slipped through!

129
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,994
I got it!

130
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:07,494
It's done for!

131
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:09,869
Over my dead body!

132
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:12,869
One... two...

133
00:10:12,952 --> 00:10:15,661
...three... four...

134
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,369
...five!

135
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,452
It's okay!

136
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,369
Uh! It's totally not!

137
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,494
Ha, ha! Aw, chill out Mio!

138
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,869
Haven't you ever heard of the five-second rule?

139
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:37,911
Haven't you heard of E. coli?! That is 100% gross!

140
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:39,119
Uh!

141
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:45,744
Tasty!

142
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:51,077
She... is such... a moron...

143
00:10:57,077 --> 00:11:00,369
♪ First comes a rock, what's it gonna be? ♪

144
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:04,452
♪ Rock-paper-scissors and a one, two, three! ♪

145
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,327
Aw...

146
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,536
Okay!

147
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:24,911
Good morning, students.

148
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,536
I hope you're having a wonderful day today.

149
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:28,952
Now that spring has sprung,

150
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:30,994
it's time to welcome a new school year.

151
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:34,119
But despite the change of seasons, the cold will stay.

152
00:11:34,202 --> 00:11:36,369
Though I'm sure the cold will come to a head for me

153
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,827
before it does for you.

154
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,577
So please take care that you don't catch a cold.

155
00:11:44,661 --> 00:11:46,036
After all,

156
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:48,994
it is my duty as principal to watch over you students.

157
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:51,536
But if you neglect to take my advice to heart,

158
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:55,369
and you do catch a cold, well... I'd say you might have

159
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,994
forgotten to respect your principal's principles.

160
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:05,077
Can I ask you something, Mio?

161
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,327
Make it quick.

162
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:07,911
We'll get in trouble if they catch us talking.

163
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,494
Do you think the principal knows
that none of his jokes are funny

164
00:12:10,577 --> 00:12:13,286
to anyone but himself? It's pretty obvious, right?

165
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,536
You'd think he would take the hint when no one laughs,

166
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:16,911
like ever, but it seems like

167
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:19,452
he's just in his own little world most of the time.

168
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:21,661
Hm. I never really thought about it.

169
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:22,702
But wait!

170
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,286
What if he does know he's not funny,

171
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,786
and he's just trying to teach the younger,

172
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:28,786
lazier generation the importance of persistence?

173
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:30,286
Possibly.

174
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:32,952
If that's the case, then the principal might actually be

175
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:34,702
some manipulative mastermind!

176
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:41,661
Mai?

177
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,411
What's her deal?

178
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:46,411
Don't tell me she's laughing at those terrible jokes!

179
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:47,952
Huh?!

180
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:50,494
I've never seen Mai crack up this much before!

181
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:52,661
She's totally busting her gut!

182
00:12:52,744 --> 00:12:54,702
All right! Here's my chance!

183
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,202
Hey, Mai!

184
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,411
I can't do it! I want to tell my own lame joke,

185
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:06,286
but it'll be too embarrassing for me!

186
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,202
Yuuko?

187
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,744
Huh?

188
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:13,161
Sorry. Never mind. It's nothing.

189
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,744
I think... I won't say anything.

190
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:24,286
I'll just leave it where it is.

191
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,827
Next on the docket, we have a necessary message

192
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:39,202
from the student counselor, Ms. Sakurai. You can step up

193
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,911
to the microphone whenever you're ready.

194
00:13:41,994 --> 00:13:44,119
Umm, I think it's your turn.

195
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:45,536
It is?!

196
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,327
Excuse me!

197
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:50,161
I'm Ms. Sakurai, your student counselor.

198
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:53,702
But umm. I-I guess you knew that already.

199
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:55,244
Oh man.

200
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,244
It's so nerve-wracking to be in front of such a big crowd.

201
00:13:58,327 --> 00:14:00,994
No, I've got to pull it together!

202
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:03,494
It's my job to be a model teacher for my students,

203
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,077
and myself! I'm going to go ahead and say

204
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,494
what needs to be said!

205
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:10,869
All right! I've noticed that there have been some

206
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:13,411
goats on the school grounds recently.

207
00:14:13,494 --> 00:14:15,536
Please try your best to not bring any goats

208
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,994
to school with you if you can help it.

209
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:19,452
Goats, you say?

210
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:21,744
And what is so bad about goats?

211
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:22,994
Huh?

212
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,869
I've read the school policies.

213
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:29,536
Nowhere does it say that we can't bring a goat to class!

214
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,994
Um, well. That's uh...

215
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:36,286
Yo, Mio. Was that Koujirou screaming about goats?

216
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,369
What? Goats, where?

217
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,827
Mm... Then.

218
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:44,577
I guess goats are perfectly fine!

219
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:45,702
Hmph.

220
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,536
Like hell your goats are fine!
You don't get to make that call!

221
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,286
Even if it's not in the school's rules, it's still weird!

222
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,744
Duly noted. But consider this, Misato.

223
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:01,286
Why should someone like me be forced to hobble to school

224
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,786
with my own two legs?

225
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,786
I am the eldest son of the Sasahara household, you know.

226
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,077
I don't give a damn about your Sasahara household!

227
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,202
You guys are a buncha normal farmers!

228
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,411
Regardless, that does not change the fact that

229
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,327
I am the eldest son of the family.

230
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,661
For real?

231
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:18,577
Koujirou comes from a family of ordinary farmers?

232
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:21,452
And here I thought he was the greatest of all time.

233
00:15:21,536 --> 00:15:23,994
That means the white goat I saw at the bike rack

234
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:25,994
must have belonged to Koujirou.

235
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,244
I can just imagine him riding majestically

236
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,452
atop that beautiful steed and whisking me away.

237
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:44,327
A happy new year to me!

238
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,286
I do.

239
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:49,452
Whoa!

240
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:50,619
Uh!

241
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:58,119
Uh. Also, make sure you don't use your cellphones

242
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,786
while riding your bikes. It's extremely dangerous!

243
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,036
And now finally...

244
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,286
I discovered this Buddha statue that someone put in

245
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:09,327
my shoe locker this morning. I just wanted to point out

246
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:11,369
that pranks like these are unacceptable!

247
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,619
Excuse us! Coming through!

248
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:15,036
A Buddha statue...

249
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:19,119
Ah! Gosh, Mai! Don't stop like that without warning!

250
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:26,369
There it is again. So this is what déjà vu feels like.

251
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,786
Uh. Who put this inside my locker?

252
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:31,369
I promise I won't be angry if you own up to it.

253
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,744
We can stand here all day

254
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,952
until someone raises their hand and confesses.

255
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,161
Who actually did it?

256
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:40,077
Just say it was you.

257
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:41,661
Uhh...

258
00:16:41,744 --> 00:16:42,827
Uh?

259
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:48,994
Uh. Well, I heard it was your
birthday through the grapevine,

260
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,369
so I wanted to get you something.

261
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:54,619
Ah, I guess I know now that a Buddha statue

262
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:57,661
doesn't exactly make a great gift.

263
00:16:57,744 --> 00:17:00,161
So. It seems as though

264
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:03,202
one thought it would be good to give a present.

265
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:06,369
But a Buddha statue is not so pleasant.

266
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,327
Sorry.

267
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:17,786
That concludes today's assembly.

268
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,994
Thank you for your words,

269
00:17:19,077 --> 00:17:21,494
and we'll all miss you dearly, Principal.

270
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,244
Vice Principal!

271
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,702
I dunno about you, but staring at this fire alarm button

272
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,494
makes me wanna push it real bad.

273
00:17:31,577 --> 00:17:32,786
Oh yeah, I get that.

274
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:36,327
Why don't you just push it?

275
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,869
I did one time and absolutely nothing happened.

276
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,619
Oh! Really?

277
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,327
--A fire? --Seriously?

278
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,452
What do we do? Book it?

279
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:48,786
Let's all scramble out of here as fast as we can!

280
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,161
What do you think you're doing?

281
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,327
Quit pushing me!

282
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,369
You shoved me first, man!

283
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,452
Are you kidding me?

284
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,411
You're really starting to tick me off!

285
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:57,619
Cut it out!

286
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:58,911
Someone could die if you start a fight now!

287
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,286
Let's just get out of here.

288
00:18:00,369 --> 00:18:01,827
You can duke it out later!

289
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:07,827
Helvetica Standard.

290
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:12,577
Excuse me.

291
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,286
Hey.

292
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:17,369
Sorry, but what does "being insensitive" mean?

293
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,202
Excuse me!

294
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:21,327
Just what does "insensitive" mean?

295
00:18:21,411 --> 00:18:22,744
Do you have a moment?

296
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,911
Can you explain what insensitive means?

297
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:26,827
Somebody help me!

298
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,702
Hey!

299
00:18:27,786 --> 00:18:29,244
Oh! Hi, Captain!

300
00:18:29,327 --> 00:18:31,536
Can you tell me what's insensitive?

301
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,702
Simple. You are.

302
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:39,786
Attention. Could Koujirou Sasahara of Class 2-P

303
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,536
please report to Tomioka in the faculty room immediately.

304
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:48,536
We understand that it's not against the school rules.

305
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:51,536
But really, a goat? Just, why?

306
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:53,244
I'll ask nicely.

307
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:56,369
Could you please stop riding a goat to school everyday?

308
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,036
Why don't you ride a bike?

309
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,036
Mister...

310
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,161
Tomioka.

311
00:19:00,244 --> 00:19:01,161
Tomioka.

312
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:02,911
Don't forget the mister.

313
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:06,286
All right, Mister,
I'd actually prefer it if you'd call him

314
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,202
"Koujirou Sasahara," and not simply "goat."

315
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:16,702
Think I'm gonna stick with "goat."

316
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,827
My name is Nano Shinonome.

317
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,577
I'm just your average robot,

318
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,827
and I live at home with my creator, Hakase.

319
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:31,327
Hakase spends every single day inside the house

320
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:34,911
doing all sorts of really important research.

321
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:37,494
And I spend those days by helping her out

322
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,702
in any way that I can.

323
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:42,536
Hakase!

324
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,994
I brought you that warm milk you asked for--

325
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,327
I don't have any special features,

326
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,077
but apparently I'm a robot that can feel pain.

327
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,744
Nano? What's the matter?

328
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,036
Hakase! I stubbed my toe! The little one!

329
00:19:58,119 --> 00:19:59,702
No!

330
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:03,911
But pinky is the littlest piggy of them all!

331
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:08,994
There, I fixed it. You should feel better now.

332
00:20:10,286 --> 00:20:11,994
I don't have any special features,

333
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,702
but apparently my pinky toe comes off?

334
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:23,661
Could you tell me what the key on my back's for?

335
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,077
Oh? Have I never wound it up for you?

336
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:27,286
No, you haven't.

337
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,869
But it spins on its own sometimes.

338
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:32,744
Give it a little twisty-twist, and...

339
00:20:32,827 --> 00:20:34,369
What's going on?

340
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:41,244
I take it back.

341
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,494
I have all sorts of special features.

342
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,619
Ya see? Pretty cool, huh?

343
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,869
So, that's it?

344
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:49,244
That's the only reason I have a key on my back?

345
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:51,119
That's right!

346
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:53,994
It really has no additional features other than that?

347
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:54,869
You got it!

348
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:56,161
Can you take it off?

349
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:56,994
No!

350
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:00,036
I wanna leave it on 'cause it looks cute.

351
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,911
But I'd really like it if you took it off.

352
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,744
Aww, it's so cute though.

353
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,494
I just wish that I could be more like a normal human.

354
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:10,369
I'd like to sit in a chair without having to twist weird.

355
00:21:10,452 --> 00:21:13,036
And be able to roll over in bed when I sleep.

356
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:15,452
With this thing,

357
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:18,369
I'll never be able to go to school.

358
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:22,869
It would have been better if you
never made me a humanoid robot.

359
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:23,952
Nano...

360
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:25,077
Huh?

361
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,952
Uhh!

362
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,161
Uh. I'm just kidding. 'Kay? It's a joke.

363
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:33,827
Stop crying. Please! I'm sorry!

364
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:35,244
Fine, take it!

365
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,077
Huh?

366
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,911
Take the Akutagawa Prize!

367
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,244
Wait, what?!

368
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:40,327
You heard me!

369
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:41,327
Akutagawa prize! You should go get it!

370
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:43,911
This is my ordinary life.

371
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,452
So, uh. Where am I?

372
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:29,702
Hello there! This is Nano's big toe speaking!

373
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:33,119
Fun fact: My storage capacity is one gigabyte.

374
00:23:33,202 --> 00:23:35,452
That's not a whole lot nowadays, is it?

375
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:39,411
Next time on <i>My Ordinary Life</i> : It's the second episode!

376
00:23:39,494 --> 00:23:40,744
Look forward to it!
