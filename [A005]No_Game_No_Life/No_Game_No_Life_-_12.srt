1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:02,198
Hey there, Izuna.

2
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:04,501
What now, please?

3
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,625
When's the last time you really had fun playing a game?

4
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:12,121
I won't lose to losers.

5
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,718
Sorry to disappoint you.

6
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,871
Everyone knows Blank never loses a game.

7
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:32,696
This is fun! Thank you!

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,012
No way!

9
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:41,222
A double jump?! You gotta be kidding! Cheater!

10
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,263
Wh‐what did she do?

11
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:05,884
I've heard of this,

12
00:01:05,956 --> 00:01:11,388
an ability only a few Warbeasts possess that
make them able to overcome all physical limits,

13
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,628
Blood Destruction.

14
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,699
I won't lose, thank you.

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,187
My, my, my.

16
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,930
This is BS! Not even Mario can do that!

17
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,258
It must be a glitch.

18
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:57,292
She's too unpredictable.

19
00:01:57,389 --> 00:01:59,245
The little kid's all over the place!

20
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,357
So then this was her real cheat all along.

21
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:18,385
The difference between their
strength is too great to overcome.

22
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,077
This battle is already over.

23
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:28,593
Okay, I predicted that things will get a
little hairy, but I really didn't expect this.

24
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,565
I can't calculate what to do.

25
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,268
I know, she's practically defying physics. So
trying to use those equations isn't gonna help us.

26
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:38,714
Sora...

27
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,361
In times like this, you can leave it to me.

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,706
I'm still king when it comes to bluffs.

29
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:50,331
At this rate of speed, she'll
no doubt predict that I'll dodge.

30
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,430
So she'll try to block both sides.

31
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:59,276
And once she decides that I won't dodge after
all, she'll fire one straight down the middle.

32
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,622
Two shots?

33
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,108
Damn it. Did she plan this from the start?

34
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:10,765
No.

35
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,556
Sora and Shiro's heartbeats have gone flat,

36
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,240
a perfect headshot.

37
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,583
There's no way to disguise that.

38
00:03:20,369 --> 00:03:24,295
You've got them, Izuna! You've got them!

39
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:44,785
I won.

40
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,590
I won, thanks!

41
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,943
Yes, I did it!

42
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,705
Thank you!

43
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,010
Huh?

44
00:03:56,766 --> 00:03:58,316
What the hell was that?

45
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,417
So‐Sora?

46
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:06,871
Did I do it? Did I get her?

47
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:10,160
Is it okay if I open my eyes now, you guys?

48
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,418
Shiro? Hey, are you guys still there?

49
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:14,623
Answer me!

50
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:16,587
Well, looks like it worked.

51
00:04:16,711 --> 00:04:17,668
Sure does.

52
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:19,380
That's bullshit!

53
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:21,370
They couldn't have planned all of that!

54
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,818
Even if you do have a sixth sense,

55
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,288
bet you didn't see that coming.

56
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,348
When Shiro bounced her shot off of the
Jibril's bullet, she wasn't aiming for you.

57
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:33,153
I was aiming below.

58
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:36,561
At Steph, who was being carried
by one of the animal girls.

59
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:37,991
That's absurd!

60
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,256
NPC movement is controlled by certain rules.

61
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,013
As a result, you can predict where they'll be.

62
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,794
And NPCs, they don't make any sound when they walk.

63
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:50,313
And since Steph was unconscious, you
couldn't sense her desire to attack you.

64
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:52,674
That means you weren't going to detect her.

65
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:54,649
Also, before the game,

66
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:59,436
I bound Steph with the pledges to obey any
order that Shiro had written on the ground,

67
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,138
but to forget that order as soon as she read it.

68
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:06,221
"Once your love power is restored, wait
until your energy is just about to run out,

69
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:08,216
and then fire straight ahead."

70
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,760
All we had to do was calculate the NPC's movements

71
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:15,286
and then lead Izuna to the predicted spot.

72
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,195
Impossible, that's not a matter of mere calculation.

73
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,903
That's like... Seeing the future, right?

74
00:05:23,005 --> 00:05:25,639
Why, it's almost like I read your mind, isn't it?

75
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:31,485
This whole game, you've been tracking our
heartbeats and pointing out our positions to Izuna.

76
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,054
They knew that we were doing this all the time

77
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,590
and took advantage of it!

78
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,057
When it comes down to it, there are really
only two actions you can take in a game.

79
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,376
Advance your own strategy

80
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,753
or to respond to another player's strategy.

81
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,978
It's a question of who has the initiative.

82
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:52,079
And in this case, we held the initiative
throughout the entire game, that's all there is to it.

83
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:56,479
You thought you were making all the moves
when in fact we were playing you like fools.

84
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:59,092
It wasn't precognition on our part.

85
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,397
The result was simply inevitable.

86
00:06:02,063 --> 00:06:04,726
You see, the weak have their own way of fighting.

87
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:10,486
We leave it to the strong to fight each other head‐on.

88
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:11,887
It's not our style.

89
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:20,790
All right, how about you tell
everybody who the winner is, Gramps?

90
00:06:25,058 --> 00:06:28,163
The winner is Elkia.

91
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,720
And so in accordance with the pledges,

92
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:36,641
the Eastern Federation turns over everything
on the continent to the kingdom of Elkia.

93
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:44,149
Sora, why did you deliberately
alter your shot and aim for my panties?

94
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:45,890
Don't ask that!

95
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:47,128
You know the answer!

96
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,679
Couldn't let all these people see my little sister naked!

97
00:06:49,704 --> 00:06:53,144
Oh, yeah, well what about me?
Does my dignity mean nothing?

98
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,455
Now, now, don't get upset. You won us the victory, Dolly.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,910
You're everyone's hero now.

100
00:06:57,935 --> 00:06:59,643
Oh, and good work from you, too.

101
00:06:59,746 --> 00:07:02,392
You pulled everything off exactly according to plan.

102
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,479
But of course, I aim to please you however I can, Master.

103
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:06,704
But now,

104
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:10,796
but now the Eastern Federation is...

105
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,410
the Warbeasts are...

106
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:17,677
Izuna, it's not your fault, my dear.

107
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,043
Our country chose to do this.

108
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,394
You were simply following my orders.

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,295
That's not it, is it, Izuna?

110
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:30,753
You're probably a little confused right now because
you actually enjoyed our little game, didn't you?

111
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:35,473
No, I would never, ever feel that way.

112
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:39,151
So many people are going to suffer because...

113
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,375
because I lost today.

114
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:43,878
But, Izuna...

115
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,818
you were smiling, weren't you?

116
00:07:48,923 --> 00:07:53,928
Why‐why did I have to go and smile like that, thank you?

117
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:59,467
Because I did, the Eastern Federation
will be taken over and so many people will...

118
00:07:59,714 --> 00:08:02,281
and it's all my fault

119
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:04,808
for having too much fun and not winning.

120
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,752
It'll be okay.

121
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:11,456
Whether you had fun or not, we would've won anyway.

122
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:15,416
So how does it feel to know
that there's an enemy out there

123
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,787
that you can't defeat no matter how hard you try?

124
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,114
I'll tell you how it feels.

125
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:21,813
It's awesome.

126
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:22,943
You'll see.

127
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:26,439
Your first loss hurt, I get that,

128
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:29,085
but that's why it was fun.

129
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,843
Now that you know how that feels,

130
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:34,480
you can be our friend.

131
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:39,295
Welcome, Izuna, you're officially a gamer now.

132
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,424
Next time, I'm not gonna lose, please.

133
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,912
You seem to have the wrong idea about this, by the way.

134
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,139
Nobody's gonna die, and nobody's going to suffer.

135
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,482
This world really is a game, you know.

136
00:08:59,601 --> 00:09:02,596
No one here seems to get that, but we do.

137
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:05,774
This is the power of Imanity's weakness,

138
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:09,820
the wisdom to see the world with
unclouded eyes and predict the future.

139
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,456
Okay, I think I can have faith in that.

140
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:16,651
Fiel, were heading home.

141
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,859
We've got lots of work ahead of us.

142
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,735
Sounds simply lovely.

143
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,957
I really hate baths, thank you.

144
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:32,843
I totally agree, but right now, you're all mine.

145
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,989
How nice, you're really into this today, Master.

146
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:38,199
As soon as I saw Izuna's fluffy tail,

147
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,582
I just had to give her...

148
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:40,464
Tickles!

149
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,805
My, the two of you are getting along
surprisingly well now, aren't you?

150
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:46,303
The way things were after the game,

151
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,058
I wouldn't have thought you would become friends.

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,585
Sora had a talk with Izuna
afterwards and straightened things out.

153
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:57,424
He told her why nobody will suffer even if
the Eastern Federation is absorbed into Elkia.

154
00:09:57,449 --> 00:09:58,894
And why is that?!

155
00:09:59,013 --> 00:09:59,545
Huh?

156
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:04,090
What lies did you tell my sweet Izuna
to gain her trust, you Goddamn ape?

157
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:06,855
What's wrong, pal? You can't handle the truth?

158
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:07,665
Come again?

159
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,206
Forget I said anything.

160
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,892
Even if I told you, there's nothing you could do.

161
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:13,951
Besides...

162
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:18,414
Guys, it's terrible! The Eastern
Federation! The Eastern Fe‐ Ugh!

163
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,156
Before the game with us even started,

164
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:27,488
the Eastern Federation moved all its special
technology and personnel off the continent, that right?

165
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:28,537
You knew already?

166
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:30,993
Well, I just figured since I'd do the same thing.

167
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:33,488
So why didn't you stop them or at least say something?

168
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:35,840
We managed to take back the
continent, but that's a serious blow.

169
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:36,880
Don't worry about it.

170
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,548
Our game with them still hasn't finished yet.

171
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:42,639
Has it...

172
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,945
representative of the Eastern Federation?

173
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:53,428
You look like you're having a splendid time.

174
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:56,502
Would you mind if I joined you for a bit?

175
00:10:57,597 --> 00:10:59,258
Sh‐Shrine‐

176
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,071
the shrine priestess.

177
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,234
Nice to meet you.

178
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,347
Hope I'm not intruding.

179
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,105
Welcome to the land beyond the sea, where
we read poetry under the light of the moon.

180
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:22,056
Are you sure you wish to allow those
hairless chimps into our inner sanctum?

181
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,072
I don't see why not.

182
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,750
The game's over, so what harm could it do?

183
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,173
Is it okay if I take pictures? Can I?! Huh?!

184
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,906
She's a dignitary from another country.

185
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:32,735
Could you be polite for once in your lives?

186
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,620
You two have really given us an awful lot of trouble.

187
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:41,330
Hmm? Well, That's Elves for ya. They
were faster than I thought they'd be.

188
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:42,600
The Elves?

189
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,087
What are you talking about?

190
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:47,408
If we moved all the people and goods off the continent,

191
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:50,196
you couldn't make good use of your newfound territory.

192
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,072
That way, you'd eventually challenge us again.

193
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,564
And then you could destroy us for good.

194
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,354
Or so that's what you thought.

195
00:11:57,437 --> 00:11:58,394
Indeed.

196
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:03,908
Who could have guessed you'd try to use a
spy to contact the Elves and expose our game?

197
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:08,270
Then everyone would know our secret,
and we wouldn't be able to win any longer.

198
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,685
Luckily...

199
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:13,894
I had already taken that into account.

200
00:12:14,418 --> 00:12:19,591
To be honest, I had assumed that you were working
in league with Elven Gard from the very beginning.

201
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:22,555
But now this problem.

202
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,185
Avant Heim was not supposed to be involved.

203
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:30,889
What?! How long have you been planning this?

204
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:32,939
You wouldn't guess by looking at me,

205
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:34,470
but I was an official there

206
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,780
on the Council of 18 Wings, that is.

207
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,240
I have a formidable degree of influence in Avant Heim.

208
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,825
First we had Elkia, then Elven Gard, and now Avant Heim.

209
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:49,918
Even with our tricks exposed, we would have
still been able to take on the puny likes of Imanity,

210
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,253
but with the Elves and the Flugel as well,

211
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:54,390
I'm afraid that's another matter.

212
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:56,470
What a mess this is.

213
00:12:57,688 --> 00:12:58,887
Here's what I'll do.

214
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:04,542
As representative of the Eastern Federation,

215
00:13:04,813 --> 00:13:07,236
I'm taking revenge on you right now.

216
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,372
Priestess, no!

217
00:13:10,106 --> 00:13:11,638
Shall I say it again?

218
00:13:12,806 --> 00:13:15,698
You've caused me an awful lot of trouble.

219
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,731
Your death will not be painless.

220
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:20,487
All righty then.

221
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,037
I accept your challenge.

222
00:13:25,321 --> 00:13:27,820
Hmm? Uh...

223
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,335
I'm sick of coming up with convoluted strategies.

224
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:34,439
Why don't we go ahead and settle this with a coin toss?

225
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:42,641
That too dull?

226
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,801
Oh, no.

227
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,596
It's just this kingdom's success,

228
00:13:46,621 --> 00:13:47,819
it's my life's work,

229
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:50,307
and it's being destroyed by shaved monkeys?

230
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,459
And to think it's all coming down a coin toss?

231
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,328
It's hilarious.

232
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,182
I knew it. You're a gamer, too, aren't you?

233
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:02,345
Okay, if I win,

234
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:07,411
Elkia gets all the Eastern Federation's territory,
including the islands outlying the continent.

235
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:11,120
And if I win the toss, the Warbeasts get the right

236
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:14,753
to self rule and a guarantee
of resources from the mainland.

237
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,675
For all your talk of revenge,

238
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,257
you're more concerned about
preserving your people's safety.

239
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,284
Well, you see, once the Elves
invade, it's over for us anyway.

240
00:14:24,418 --> 00:14:27,130
This is the least I can do given the situation.

241
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,404
Promise me even if I lose this game,

242
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:36,648
Izuna and Ino and all of my
people will be under your protection.

243
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:38,467
Oh, Priestess.

244
00:14:38,716 --> 00:14:39,905
Of course.

245
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:41,360
You're not so bad.

246
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,164
Yes, yes, can we begin?

247
00:14:44,696 --> 00:14:49,572
All right, let's have the most hard‐core
coin toss ever recorded in history.

248
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:50,455
I'll let you pick.

249
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,847
Which one do you want, heads or tails?

250
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,857
I'll just go with whatever you don't.

251
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:56,788
Are you sure?

252
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,026
Yes, Ma'am.

253
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,033
Ready?

254
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:03,716
Achente!

255
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,275
Blood Destruction!

256
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:21,512
Now I can free myself from all physical boundaries and
begin to grasp all the subtle nuances in the environment.

257
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:27,255
At the rate the coin is currently falling, I
predict that it will hit the ground after 142 flips,

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,183
bounce four times, spin 5.2 seconds, and land on tails.

259
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:34,144
Hmm.

260
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:37,347
I don't detect any magic in the vicinity.

261
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,032
Did they underestimate my kinetic vision?

262
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,726
No, I seriously doubt that.

263
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,275
Although...

264
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,640
I pick tails.

265
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:05,442
You gotta be shitting me.

266
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:07,705
A draw.

267
00:16:11,018 --> 00:16:12,421
What, for real?

268
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:14,815
Oh, boy! Isn't that something else?

269
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,198
Sure didn't see that coming, eh? What a pickle.

270
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,407
Do we both win or do we both lose?

271
00:16:19,432 --> 00:16:20,791
Hmm, which could it be?

272
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:23,325
Sora, you're not fooling anybody, dummy.

273
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,169
Of course.

274
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,179
This was your goal from the start.

275
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:33,741
You know, if we both win, then that
could mean both of our demands are fulfilled.

276
00:16:34,018 --> 00:16:36,980
If so, you'd end up under Elkia's control,

277
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,444
but your rights are assured

278
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,635
and you keep the ability to self rule.

279
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,951
Then we could both share the continent's resources.

280
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,094
The Eastern Federation becomes the Elkia Federation.

281
00:16:46,237 --> 00:16:49,066
Well then, do we both win or do we both lose?

282
00:16:49,193 --> 00:16:49,844
Which one?

283
00:16:50,074 --> 00:16:54,756
Don't listen to him! He wants to take the
Eastern Federation and destroy the Warbeasts!

284
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:56,972
Ino, you've got it all wrong, thanks.

285
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:03,272
I beg your pardon, Sir, but what could possibly possess
me to bring harm to my newfound animal‐girl paradise?!

286
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:07,395
It's filled to the brim with adorable
little kitty and puppy and fox girls like Izuna!

287
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,215
Why the hell would I ever want
to destroy a treasure like that?

288
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,504
Dude, rein it in.

289
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:14,489
Honestly...

290
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,035
to think that we've been playing
into your hands this whole time.

291
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:23,526
However, even if our nations do unite, thanks to you,

292
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,169
the Elves now know all our secrets.

293
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:28,958
Elven Gard will declare war on us eventually.

294
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:30,427
You're right, and when they do,

295
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,218
how about we make them regret they made that decision?

296
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,680
You honestly think you can do that?

297
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,351
Hell, yeah, I can. The thing about that spy?

298
00:17:41,264 --> 00:17:46,166
She actually had her memories altered by the
pledges before she reported to the Elven Gard,

299
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:49,170
so she gave them the wrong information about your game.

300
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:56,092
So then the reason you fought Kurami for
the right to alter her memories, that was...

301
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,481
It was for this very day.

302
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:03,391
Now when Elven Gard attacks us,
we're sure to win against them.

303
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,036
Then we get to claim the Elves' nation, too.

304
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:09,127
You're telling me you thought this through that far?

305
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,308
Checkmate doesn't mean you've
simply cornered the enemy king.

306
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,895
It's a declaration that the enemy king is yours.

307
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,319
That's why I said it the first time I met you.

308
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,323
Check and mate. Get it?

309
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,868
Okay, so which will it be?

310
00:18:26,924 --> 00:18:29,275
Do we both win, or do we both lose?

311
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,784
It's all up to you.

312
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:34,399
Are you really gonna make me say it?

313
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:35,479
Okay, fine.

314
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,762
Have it your way. We both win.

315
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:42,877
Okay, good deal.

316
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:46,061
The Elkia Federation is born.

317
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:52,044
So what you plan to do now?

318
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:55,691
Please don't tell me you're thinking
about starting another Great War.

319
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:59,107
If I wanted that, I would've taken your race piece.

320
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,704
But those must never be taken, so we won't.

321
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:05,193
That's right. Our goal has never changed.

322
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,623
It's simple and straightforward.

323
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:09,895
We must defeat Tet.

324
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:11,048
And that's it.

325
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:12,755
Defeat Tet? How?

326
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,979
But he's God. That's not possible.

327
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:16,425
Oh, yeah, why not?

328
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:17,633
Yeah, why not?

329
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,406
Oh, you're going to try to beat a God?

330
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:31,099
My, you do come up with the strangest ideas.

331
00:19:31,124 --> 00:19:32,709
You actually think you can do it?

332
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:33,358
Don't know.

333
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:37,829
We don't have any clues about the
specifics, but we have some hints.

334
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,581
Like here, why are the race
pieces shaped the way they are?

335
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:43,819
And then...

336
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:48,643
Why are there precisely 16 races of
Exceed in this world, not more or less?

337
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:49,794
And finally...

338
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,510
What are those things I see on the horizon?

339
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:59,327
So you think that gathering all the pieces
is what gives you the right to challenge God?

340
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:03,776
But wait, doesn't that mean you need to
take each of our race pieces to play the game?

341
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,089
I doubt it.

342
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:09,655
'Cause you see, that would go against the pledges.

343
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:10,982
Why do you think that?

344
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,208
Simple, why put in a rule that
doesn't have to be followed?

345
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:17,323
Maybe you forgot.

346
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:19,428
Forgot what?

347
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,636
Pledge number ten of course,

348
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:23,574
perhaps the most important one.

349
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,925
Let's all have fun and play together!

350
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,547
In other words,

351
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,066
if we're not all together having fun,

352
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:32,409
we can't beat the game.

353
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:35,101
You see, we don't need to steal each other's pieces.

354
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:39,813
Like the legend says, each of the races,
the 16 races who call themselves wise,

355
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:41,920
must use their ingenuity and wit,

356
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,850
their great fortunes and power,

357
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,916
to build a tower of knowledge on Disboard.

358
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:48,291
Prove to me your strength of mind.

359
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm not asking for that much from you, right?

360
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,765
That's great! Wonderful!

361
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:56,498
This really is getting fun.

362
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,064
I was so right to bring those two here.

363
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:03,927
I'm waiting for you! We'll have the best game ever!

364
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:06,652
Bring all your friends along, too!

365
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:08,701
Until then...

366
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:28,288
Elven Gard, the largest country in the world,
and we're supposed to tear it apart from within.

367
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:30,425
He makes it sound like that's easy.

368
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,245
Oh, I'm sure he has a plan.

369
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,304
Well, if he does, I'd like to know what it is.

370
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,750
I guess we'll come up with something.

371
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,714
Otherwise, Imanity doesn't really stand a chance.

372
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,184
It'll work out.

373
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,479
A way for the weak to defeat a strong

374
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:45,750
while remaining weak,

375
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,180
a way to stay who you are but at
the same time surpass your limits,

376
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:54,013
to soar through the sky even though you don't have wings.

377
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:57,891
Despite all the despair, suffering, and darkness,

378
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:01,029
he's always managed to find a path of the light.

379
00:22:01,641 --> 00:22:04,081
I knew I wasn't just imagining things.

380
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:07,234
Something about you has changed, Kurami.

381
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,250
Yeah?

382
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:11,016
I guess Sora's confidence is wearing off on me.

383
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,363
And if I have you, then I can do anything.

384
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,172
And I'll be happy to help out.

385
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:26,063
I would take on the entire world for you,

386
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:28,613
which might actually be the case.

387
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:31,101
You may be right.

388
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:33,142
Well, let's see what we can do.

389
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:37,013
Well, we'd better get going.

390
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,330
Oh, thank goodness.

391
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,317
What about the other thingy?

392
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,550
Don't worry, I hadn't forgotten.

393
00:22:43,351 --> 00:22:46,086
Huh? Um, forgotten about what?

394
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,406
Thought of something else to try
and take away from our Priestess?!

395
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:51,026
Think again, Primate!

396
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:53,847
It's not really something we want, per se.

397
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:57,080
If you're a shrine priestess, you must have one, right?

398
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,313
We've been wondering if you could call it.

399
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,513
Oh.

400
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:17,349
What did she just do?! What's going on?!

401
00:23:17,374 --> 00:23:19,399
What an amazing level of power.

402
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:23,331
Divine core manifestation,

403
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,583
mind meld established.

404
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,910
Power setting minimal.

405
00:23:28,665 --> 00:23:30,422
Why have you summoned me,

406
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:33,477
you creatures of the finite lifespans?

407
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,629
Exceed rank number one...

408
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,004
the Old Deus.

409
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:41,198
Exceed rank... one?

410
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:42,438
Old...

411
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:45,562
Old Deus!

412
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:49,056
Okay.

413
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:52,560
Let the games begin.
