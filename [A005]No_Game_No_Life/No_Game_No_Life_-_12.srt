1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:03,670
Hey there, Izuna.

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:04,905
What now, please?

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:05,972
Sora:
<i>When's the last time</i>

4
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:10,143
<i>you really had fun</i>
<i>playing a game, huh?</i>

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,412
Izuna:
<i>I won't lose to losers.</i>

6
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,549
Sora:
<i>Sorry to disappoint you.</i>

7
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,785
Shiro:
Everyone knows
Blank never loses a game.

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,700
This is fun!
Thank you!

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,438
No way!

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,541
A double jump?!

11
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,275
You gotta be kidding!
Cheater!

12
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,049
( grunts )

13
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,231
Wh‐what did she do?

14
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,967
Kurami:
I've heard of this,

15
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:08,969
an ability only
a few Warbeasts possess

16
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,372
<i>that make them able to overcome</i>
<i>all physical limits,</i>

17
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,675
<i>Blood Destruction.</i>

18
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,446
I won't lose, thank you.

19
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,417
My, my, my.

20
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,356
<i>( door closes )</i>

21
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,200
This is BS!
Not even Mario can do that!

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,968
It must be a glitch.

23
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:43,269
( roars )

24
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,679
She's too unpredictable.

25
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,115
The little kid's
all over the place!

26
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,254
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>So then this was her</i>
<i>real cheat all along.</i>

27
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,663
Ino:
<i>( laughs )</i>

28
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,998
<i>The difference between</i>
<i>their strength</i>

29
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>is too great to overcome.</i>

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,270
<i>This battle is already over.</i>

31
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,542
Sora:
<i>Okay, I predicted that</i>
<i>things will get a little hairy,</i>

32
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,878
<i>but I really</i>
<i>didn't expect this.</i>

33
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,080
I can't calculate
what to do.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,550
I know, she's practically
defying physics.

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,153
So trying to use those equations
isn't gonna help us.

36
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,387
Sora...

37
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:37,390
In times like this,
you can leave it to me.

38
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,926
I'm still king when
it comes to bluffs.

39
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,164
Sora:
<i>At this rate of speed,</i>

40
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,067
<i>she'll no doubt predict</i>
<i>that I'll dodge.</i>

41
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:50,036
<i>So she'll try to block</i>
<i>both sides.</i>

42
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,372
<i>And once she decides</i>
<i>that I won't dodge after all,</i>

43
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,676
<i>she'll fire one</i>
<i>straight down the middle.</i>

44
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,010
( gasps )

45
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,879
<i>Two shots?</i>

46
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,449
<i>Damn it. Did she plan</i>
<i>this from the start?</i>

47
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,553
No.

48
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:11,124
Ino:
<i>Sora and Shiro's</i>
<i>heartbeats have gone flat,</i>

49
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,693
<i>a perfect headshot.</i>

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,662
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>to disguise that.</i>

51
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:20,233
<i>You've got them, Izuna!</i>
<i>You've got them!</i>

52
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,803
( panting, heartbeat pounding )

53
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:33,446
<i>( heartbeat slowing )</i>

54
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,654
I won.

55
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,423
<i>I won, thanks!</i>

56
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,192
Yes, I did it!

57
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,994
Thank you!
<i>( gunshot )</i>

58
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,565
Huh?

59
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,234
What the hell was that?

60
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,406
So‐Sora?

61
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,275
Did I do it?
Did I get her?

62
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,846
Is it okay if I open my eyes
now, you guys?

63
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>Steph:</i>
<i>Shiro? Hey, are you</i>
<i>guys still there?</i>

64
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>Answer me!</i>

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,052
Well, looks
like it worked.

66
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,086
Sure does.

67
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,721
That's bullshit!

68
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,058
They couldn't have planned
all of that!

69
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,226
Even if you do have
a sixth sense,

70
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,228
bet you didn't see
that coming.

71
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,298
<i>When Shiro bounced her shot</i>
<i>off of the Jibril's bullet,</i>

72
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,000
<i>she wasn't aiming for you.</i>

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,802
Shiro:
<i>I was aiming below.</i>

74
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,403
Sora:
<i>At Steph, who was being carried</i>

75
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,005
<i>by one of the animal girls.</i>

76
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,507
That's absurd!

77
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,577
Sora:
<i>NPC movement is</i>
<i>controlled by certain rules.</i>

78
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,112
Shiro:
<i>As a result, you can predict</i>
<i>where they'll be.</i>

79
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,315
Sora:
<i>And NPCs, they don't make</i>
<i>any sound when they walk.</i>

80
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,984
<i>And since Steph</i>
<i>was unconscious,</i>

81
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,819
<i>you couldn't sense</i>
<i>her desire to attack you.</i>

82
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,254
That means you weren't
going to detect her.

83
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,990
Also, before the game,

84
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,593
<i>I bound Steph</i>
<i>with the pledges to obey</i>

85
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,828
<i>any order that Shiro</i>
<i>had written on the ground,</i>

86
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,564
<i>but to forget that order</i>
<i>as soon as she read it.</i>

87
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>"Once your love power</i>
<i>is restored,</i>

88
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,702
<i>wait until your energy</i>
<i>is just about to run out,</i>

89
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>and then fire</i>
<i>straight ahead."</i>

90
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,041
Shiro:
<i>All we had to do was</i>
<i>calculate the NPC's movements</i>

91
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,844
<i>and then lead Izuna</i>
<i>to the predicted spot.</i>

92
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:15,215
Ino:
Impossible, that's not
a matter of mere calculation.

93
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,139
That's like...

94
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,418
Sora:
<i>Seeing the future, right?</i>

95
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,022
Why, it's almost like
I read your mind, isn't it?

96
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:23,690
<i>This whole game,</i>
<i>you've been tracking</i>

97
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,893
<i>our heartbeats and pointing</i>
<i>out our positions to Izuna.</i>

98
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,395
Ino:
<i>They knew that we were</i>
<i>doing this all the time</i>

99
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,931
<i>and took advantage of it!</i>

100
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,799
Sora:
<i>When it comes down to it,</i>
<i>there are really</i>

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,502
<i>only two actions</i>
<i>you can take in a game.</i>

102
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,871
Shiro:
<i>Advance your own strategy</i>

103
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,507
<i>or to respond to another</i>
<i>player's strategy.</i>

104
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,576
<i>It's a question</i>
<i>of who has the initiative.</i>

105
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,578
Sora:
And in this case,
we held the initiative

106
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,748
throughout the entire game,
that's all there is to it.

107
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,516
You thought you were
making all the moves

108
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,918
when in fact we were
playing you like fools.

109
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,655
<i>It wasn't precognition</i>
<i>on our part.</i>

110
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,857
<i>The result</i>
<i>was simply inevitable.</i>

111
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,694
<i>You see, the weak have</i>
<i>their own way of fighting.</i>

112
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,029
( chuckles )

113
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,266
We leave it to the strong
to fight each other head‐on.

114
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,901
It's not our style.

115
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,541
<i>All right, how about</i>
<i>you tell everybody</i>

116
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,176
<i>who the winner is, Gramps?</i>

117
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,378
( grunting angrily )

118
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,817
Ino:
<i>The winner is Elkia.</i>

119
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,086
<i>And so in accordance</i>
<i>with the pledges,</i>

120
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,088
<i>the Eastern Federation</i>
<i>turns over everything</i>

121
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:31,491
<i>on the continent</i>
<i>to the kingdom of Elkia.</i>

122
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,361
( cheering )

123
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,264
Sora, why did you
deliberately alter your shot

124
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,566
<i>and aim for my panties?</i>

125
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,768
Sora:
Don't ask that!
You know the answer!

126
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,938
Couldn't let all these people
see my little sister naked!

127
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,709
Oh, yeah, well what about me?
Does my dignity mean nothing?

128
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,411
Now, now, don't get upset.
You won us the victory, Dolly.

129
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,413
You're everyone's hero now.

130
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,148
Oh, and good work
from you, too.

131
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,784
You pulled everything off
exactly according to plan.

132
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,353
But of course, I aim to please
you however I can, Master.

133
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,955
Izuna:
But now‐

134
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,560
but now the Eastern
Federation is‐

135
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,862
<i>the Warbeasts are‐</i>

136
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,466
Izuna, it's not
your fault, my dear.

137
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,569
Our country chose to do this.

138
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,838
You were simply
following my orders.

139
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,607
Sora:
<i>That's not it, is it, Izuna?</i>

140
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,342
You're probably a little
confused right now

141
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,680
because you actually enjoyed
our little game, didn't you?

142
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:31,384
No, I would never,
ever feel that way.

143
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,354
So many people
are going to suffer because‐

144
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,823
because I lost today.

145
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,393
But, Izuna...

146
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,896
<i>you were smiling,</i>
<i>weren't you?</i>

147
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:49,269
Why‐why did I have to go
and smile like that, thank you?

148
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,638
Because I did,
the Eastern Federation

149
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,542
will be taken over
and so many people will‐

150
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,744
and it's all my fault

151
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,446
for having too much fun
and not winning.

152
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,183
Sora:
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

153
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:07,954
Whether you had fun or not,
we would've won anyway.

154
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,757
So how does it feel to know
that there's an enemy out there

155
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,127
that you can't defeat
no matter how hard you try?

156
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:15,829
I'll tell you how it feels.

157
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,297
Both:
It's awesome.

158
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,565
You'll see.

159
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,102
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Your first loss hurt,</i>
<i>I get that,</i>

160
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,938
<i>but that's why it was fun.</i>

161
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,308
Now that you know
how that feels,

162
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,777
you can be our friend.

163
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:35,215
Welcome, Izuna, you're
officially a gamer now.

164
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,858
Next time,
I'm not gonna lose, please.

165
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,362
Sora:
<i>You seem to have the wrong idea</i>
<i>about this, by the way.</i>

166
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,599
<i>Nobody's gonna die,</i>
<i>and nobody's going to suffer.</i>

167
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:55,001
<i>This world really</i>
<i>is a game, you know.</i>

168
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,238
<i>No one here seems</i>
<i>to get that, but we do.</i>

169
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:01,174
Kurami:
This is the power
of Imanity's weakness,

170
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:03,610
the wisdom to see the world
with unclouded eyes

171
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,547
and predict the future.

172
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,783
Okay, I think I can
have faith in that.

173
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,118
Fiel, were heading home.

174
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,487
We've got lots of work
ahead of us.

175
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,890
Sounds simply lovely.

176
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,793
( children laughing,
crowd cheering )

177
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,298
I really hate baths,
thank you.

178
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,301
I totally agree, but right now,
you're all mine.

179
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,572
How nice, you're really
into this today, Master.

180
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,540
As soon as I saw
Izuna's fluffy tail,

181
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,075
I just had to give her...

182
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,010
Tickles! ( laughs )

183
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,679
My, the two of you
are getting along

184
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,146
surprisingly well now,
aren't you?

185
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,314
The way things
were after the game,

186
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,584
I wouldn't have thought
you would become friends.

187
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,619
Sora had a talk
with Izuna afterwards

188
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,953
and straightened things out.

189
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,289
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>He told her</i>
<i>why nobody will suffer</i>

190
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,126
<i>even if the Eastern Federation</i>
<i>is absorbed into Elkia.</i>

191
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,561
And why is that?!

192
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:54,995
Huh?

193
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,130
What lies did you tell
my sweet Izuna

194
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,232
to gain her trust,
you Goddamn ape?

195
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:02,503
What's wrong, pal?
You can't handle the truth?

196
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,436
Come again?

197
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,404
Forget I said anything.

198
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:07,608
Even if I told you,
there's nothing you could do.

199
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,163
Besides...

200
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:11,578
Guys, it's terrible!
The Eastern Federation!

201
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,314
The Eastern Fe‐
( screams ) Ugh!

202
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,784
Before the game with us
even started,

203
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,286
the Eastern Federation moved
all its special technology

204
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,889
and personnel off the continent,
that right?

205
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,724
You knew already?

206
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,992
Well, I just figured
since I'd do the same thing.

207
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,829
So why didn't you stop them
or at least say something?

208
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,396
We managed to take back
the continent,

209
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:31,464
but that's a serious blow.

210
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,633
Don't worry about it.

211
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,636
Our game with them
still hasn't finished yet.

212
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,839
Has it...

213
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,675
representative of the
Eastern Federation?

214
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,779
( laughs )

215
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,082
You look like you're having
a splendid time.

216
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:52,052
Would you mind
if I joined you for a bit?

217
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,689
( gasps )
Sh‐Shrine‐

218
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,191
<i>the shrine priestess.</i>

219
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,395
Nice to meet you.

220
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,364
Hope I'm not intruding.

221
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:11,572
<i>Welcome to the land</i>
<i>beyond the sea,</i>

222
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,576
<i>where we read poetry</i>
<i>under the light of the moon.</i>

223
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:19,012
Ino:
<i>Are you sure you wish to</i>
<i>allow those hairless chimps</i>

224
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,281
<i>into our inner sanctum?</i>

225
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,749
I don't see why not.

226
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,118
The game's over,
so what harm could it do?

227
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,353
Sora:
Is it okay if I take pictures?
Can I?! Huh?!

228
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,322
She's a dignitary
from another country.

229
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,124
Could you be polite
for once in your lives?

230
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:35,061
You two have really given us
an awful lot of trouble.

231
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,031
Hmm? ( laughs )
Well, That's Elves for ya.

232
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,833
They were faster
than I thought they'd be.

233
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,334
Ino:
The Elves?

234
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,503
What are you
talking about?

235
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:45,572
If we moved all the people
and goods off the continent,

236
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:48,809
you couldn't make good use
of your newfound territory.

237
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,377
That way, you'd eventually
challenge us again.

238
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,980
Sora:
And then you could
destroy us for good.

239
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,282
<i>Or so that's what you thought.</i>

240
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,718
Indeed.

241
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,120
Who could have guessed
you'd try to use a spy

242
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,656
<i>to contact the Elves</i>
<i>and expose our game?</i>

243
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,991
<i>Then everyone</i>
<i>would know our secret,</i>

244
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,227
<i>and we wouldn't be able</i>
<i>to win any longer.</i>

245
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,930
<i>Shrine Priestess:</i>
<i>Luckily...</i>

246
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,566
I had already
taken that into account.

247
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:16,069
<i>To be honest, I had assumed</i>
<i>that you were working in league</i>

248
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,072
<i>with Elven Gard</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

249
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,107
But now this problem.

250
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,211
<i>Avant Heim was not supposed</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

251
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:29,249
What?! How long have you
been planning this?

252
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,852
You wouldn't guess
by looking at me,

253
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:32,886
but I was an official there

254
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,221
on the Council of
18 Wings, that is.

255
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,125
I have a formidable degree
of influence in Avant Heim.

256
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,528
First we had Elkia,
then Elven Gard,

257
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,329
and now Avant Heim.

258
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,366
Even with our tricks exposed,
we would have still been able

259
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,334
to take on the puny
likes of Imanity,

260
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,971
but with the Elves
and the Flugel as well,

261
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,339
I'm afraid that's
another matter.

262
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,542
What a mess this is.

263
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,144
Here's what I'll do.

264
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,983
As representative
of the Eastern Federation,

265
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:06,219
I'm taking revenge
on you right now.

266
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:06,720
( screams )

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,689
Priestess, no!

268
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,124
Shall I say it again?

269
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,695
You've caused me an
awful lot of trouble.

270
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,297
Your death will
not be painless.

271
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,866
All righty then.

272
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,002
<i>I accept your challenge.</i>

273
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,573
Hmm? Uh...

274
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,776
I'm sick of coming up
with convoluted strategies.

275
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:33,013
Why don't we go ahead and
settle this with a coin toss?

276
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:38,018
( laughs )

277
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,622
That too dull?

278
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,923
Oh, no.

279
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,091
It's just this
kingdom's success,

280
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,359
it's my life's work,

281
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,829
and it's being destroyed
by shaved monkeys?

282
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,132
And to think it's all
coming down a coin toss?

283
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:56,169
It's hilarious.
( laughs )

284
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,405
I knew it. You're a gamer,
too, aren't you?

285
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:01,007
Okay, if I win,

286
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,644
Elkia gets all the Eastern
Federation's territory,

287
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,212
including the islands
outlying the continent.

288
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,449
And if I win the toss,
the Warbeasts get the right

289
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:13,587
to self rule and a guarantee
of resources from the mainland.

290
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,388
For all your talk of revenge,

291
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,759
you're more concerned about
preserving your people's safety.

292
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,628
Well, you see,
once the Elves invade,

293
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,096
it's over for us anyway.

294
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,232
This is the least I can do
given the situation.

295
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:30,236
Promise me even if
I lose this game,

296
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,306
Izuna and Ino
and all of my people

297
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:35,776
will be under
your protection.

298
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,443
Oh, Priestess.

299
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,912
Of course.

300
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,213
You're not so bad.

301
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,949
Yes, yes, can we begin?

302
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,019
Sora:
<i>All right, let's have</i>
<i>the most hard‐core coin toss</i>

303
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,988
<i>ever recorded in history.</i>

304
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,255
I'll let you pick.

305
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,491
Which one do you want,
heads or tails?

306
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,860
I'll just go
with whatever you don't.

307
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,862
Are you sure?

308
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,063
Yes, Ma'am.

309
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,134
Ready?

310
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,069
Both:
Achente!

311
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,943
( roars )

312
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:12,145
Blood Destruction!

313
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,282
<i>Now I can free myself</i>
<i>from all physical boundaries</i>

314
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,719
<i>and begin to grasp</i>
<i>all the subtle nuances</i>

315
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:20,253
<i>in the environment.</i>

316
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,222
<i>At the rate the coin</i>
<i>is currently falling,</i>

317
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:25,491
<i>I predict that it will hit</i>
<i>the ground after 142 flips,</i>

318
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,695
<i>bounce four times,</i>
<i>spin 5.2 seconds,</i>

319
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,632
<i>and land on tails.</i>

320
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:32,933
<i>Hmm.</i>

321
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,902
<i>I don't detect</i>
<i>any magic in the vicinity.</i>

322
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,739
<i>Did they underestimate</i>
<i>my kinetic vision?</i>

323
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,307
<i>No, I seriously doubt that.</i>

324
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,044
<i>Although...</i>

325
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,248
I pick tails.

326
00:16:01,862 --> 00:16:04,798
Ino:
You gotta be shitting me.

327
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,499
Shiro:
<i>A draw.</i>

328
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,837
What, for real?

329
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,106
Oh, boy! Isn't that
something else?

330
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,509
Sure didn't see that
coming, eh? What a pickle.

331
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,778
Do we both win
or do we both lose?

332
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,345
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Hmm, which could it be?</i>

333
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,915
Sora, you're not
fooling anybody, dummy.

334
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,850
Of course.

335
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,252
<i>This was your goal</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

336
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,390
You know, if we both win,
then that could mean

337
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,325
both of our demands
are fulfilled.

338
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,428
If so, you'd end up
under Elkia's control,

339
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,097
<i>but your rights</i>
<i>are assured</i>

340
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,832
<i>and you keep the</i>
<i>ability to self rule.</i>

341
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,367
<i>Then we could both share</i>
<i>the continent's resources.</i>

342
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,404
Shiro:
<i>The Eastern Federation</i>
<i>becomes the Elkia Federation.</i>

343
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,641
Well then, do we both win
or do we both lose?

344
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:48,775
Which one?

345
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,409
Don't listen to him!

346
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,978
He wants to take
the Eastern Federation

347
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,246
and destroy the Warbeasts!

348
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,248
Ino, you've got
it all wrong, thanks.

349
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,619
I beg your pardon, Sir, but what
could possibly possess me

350
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:01,722
to bring harm to my newfound
animal‐girl paradise?!

351
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:03,624
It's filled to the brim
with adorable little kitty

352
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:05,559
and puppy and fox girls
like Izuna!

353
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,995
Why the hell would I ever want
to destroy a treasure like that?

354
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,932
Dude, rein it in.

355
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,366
Shrine Priestess:
Honestly...

356
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:18,138
to think that we've been playing
into your hands this whole time.

357
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,942
However, even if our nations
do unite, thanks to you,

358
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,678
the Elves now know
all our secrets.

359
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:28,148
Elven Gard will declare
war on us eventually.

360
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,816
You're right,
and when they do,

361
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:33,319
how about we make them regret
they made that decision?

362
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,288
You honestly think
you can do that?

363
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:39,459
Hell, yeah, I can.
The thing about that spy?

364
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,495
<i>She actually had her memories</i>
<i>altered by the pledges</i>

365
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,698
<i>before she reported</i>
<i>to the Elven Gard,</i>

366
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:49,235
<i>so she gave them the wrong</i>
<i>information about your game.</i>

367
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,572
So then the reason
you fought Kurami

368
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,508
<i>for the right to alter</i>
<i>her memories, that was...</i>

369
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:57,911
Shiro:
<i>It was for this very day.</i>

370
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,148
Now when Elven Gard attacks us,
we're sure to win against them.

371
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,651
Then we get to claim
the Elves' nation, too.

372
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,621
You're telling me you thought
this through that far?

373
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,724
Checkmate doesn't mean you've
simply cornered the enemy king.

374
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:14,494
It's a declaration
that the enemy king is yours.

375
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:18,031
<i>That's why I said it</i>
<i>the first time I met you.</i>

376
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,702
Check and mate. Get it?

377
00:18:21,702 --> 00:18:23,904
( gasps )

378
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,539
Okay, so which will it be?

379
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,974
Do we both win,
or do we both lose?

380
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,310
<i>It's all up to you.</i>

381
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,079
Are you really
gonna make me say it?

382
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,181
Okay, fine.

383
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,584
Have it your way.
We both win.

384
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:41,655
Okay, good deal.

385
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,691
Sora and Shiro:
<i>The Elkia Federation is born.</i>

386
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,167
Shrine Priestess:
So what you plan to do now?

387
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,902
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

388
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,138
about starting
another Great War.

389
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,305
If I wanted that,

390
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,807
I would've taken
your race piece.

391
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,710
But those must never be taken,
so we won't.

392
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,480
That's right.
Our goal has never changed.

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,583
It's simple and straightforward.

394
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,985
Both:
We must defeat Tet.

395
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,219
And that's it.

396
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,387
Defeat Tet? How?

397
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,057
But he's God.
That's not possible.

398
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,124
Oh, yeah, why not?

399
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,760
Yeah, why not?

400
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,597
( laughs )

401
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,303
Shrine Priestess:
Oh, you're going
to try to beat a God?

402
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,238
My, you do come up
with the strangest ideas.

403
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:34,274
You actually think
you can do it?

404
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:34,975
Shiro:
Don't know.

405
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:36,309
Sora:
We don't have any clues

406
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,080
about the specifics,
but we have some hints.

407
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,751
Like here, why are the race
pieces shaped the way they are?

408
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:45,777
Shiro:
<i>And then...</i>

409
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,054
Sora:
<i>Why are there precisely</i>
<i>16 races of Exceed</i>

410
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,356
<i>in this world,</i>
<i>not more or less?</i>

411
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,024
Shiro:
And finally...

412
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:55,328
Sora:
<i>What are those things</i>
<i>I see on the horizon?</i>

413
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,732
So you think that gathering
all the pieces

414
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,801
<i>is what gives you the right</i>
<i>to challenge God?</i>

415
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:03,303
<i>But wait, doesn't that mean</i>
<i>you need to take</i>

416
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:05,706
<i>each of our race pieces</i>
<i>to play the game?</i>

417
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,041
Sora:
I doubt it.

418
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,444
'Cause you see, that would go
against the pledges.

419
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,113
Why do you
think that?

420
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:17,250
Simple‐ why put in a rule that
doesn't have to be followed?

421
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,886
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>Maybe you forgot.</i>

422
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,187
Steph:
<i>Forgot what?</i>

423
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,423
Sora:
<i>Pledge number ten of course,</i>

424
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,526
<i>perhaps the most important one.</i>

425
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:28,862
Let's all have fun
and play together!

426
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:30,396
Sora:
<i>In other words,</i>

427
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,833
<i>if we're not all together</i>
<i>having fun,</i>

428
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:33,934
<i>we can't beat the game.</i>

429
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:36,837
<i>You see, we don't need</i>
<i>to steal each other's pieces.</i>

430
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:39,205
<i>Like the legend says,</i>
<i>each of the races,</i>

431
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:41,474
<i>the 16 races</i>
<i>who call themselves wise,</i>

432
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,010
<i>must use their</i>
<i>ingenuity and wit,</i>

433
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,579
<i>their great fortunes and power,</i>

434
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,848
<i>to build a tower</i>
<i>of knowledge on Disboard.</i>

435
00:20:47,848 --> 00:20:49,916
Prove to me
your strength of mind.

436
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,620
I'm not asking for
that much from you, right?

437
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,688
( laughs )

438
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:56,557
That's great!
Wonderful!

439
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:58,424
This really is getting fun.

440
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,461
I was so right
to bring those two here.

441
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:05,732
I'm waiting for you!
We'll have the best game ever!

442
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,502
<i>Bring all your</i>
<i>friends along, too!</i>

443
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:10,837
<i>Until then...</i>

444
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,888
Kurami:
<i>Elven Gard, the largest</i>
<i>country in the world,</i>

445
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:30,323
<i>and we're supposed</i>
<i>to tear it apart from within.</i>

446
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,392
He makes it sound
like that's easy.

447
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,294
Oh, I'm sure he
has a plan.

448
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:37,163
Well, if he does, I'd like
to know what it is.

449
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,465
I guess we'll come up
with something.

450
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,503
Otherwise, Imanity doesn't
really stand a chance.

451
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:43,837
It'll work out.

452
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:46,106
A way for the weak
to defeat a strong

453
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,340
while remaining weak,

454
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,309
<i>a way to stay who you are</i>

455
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,745
<i>but at the same time</i>
<i>surpass your limits,</i>

456
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:55,682
<i>to soar through the sky even</i>
<i>though you don't have wings.</i>

457
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,185
<i>Despite all the despair,</i>
<i>suffering, and darkness,</i>

458
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,856
<i>he's always managed</i>
<i>to find a path of the light.</i>

459
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:05,592
I knew I wasn't just
imagining things.

460
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:08,862
Something about you
has changed, Kurami.

461
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:09,930
Yeah?

462
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,433
I guess Sora's confidence
is wearing off on me.

463
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:18,371
And if I have you,
then I can do anything.

464
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,709
( laughs )

465
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,845
And I'll be happy
to help out.

466
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,781
I would take on
the entire world for you,

467
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,883
which might actually
be the case.

468
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:32,619
Kurami:
<i>( laughs )</i>
<i>You may be right.</i>

469
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,921
<i>Well, let's see</i>
<i>what we can do.</i>

470
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,258
Well, we'd better
get going.

471
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,492
Steph:
Oh, thank goodness.

472
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,795
What about
the other thingy?

473
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:44,765
Don't worry,
I hadn't forgotten.

474
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,701
Huh? Um, forgotten
about what?

475
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:48,869
Thought of something else

476
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,071
to try and take away
from our Priestess?!

477
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,706
Think again, Primate!

478
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,709
It's not really
something we want, per se.

479
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,712
<i>If you're a shrine priestess,</i>
<i>you must have one, right?</i>

480
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,381
Shiro:
<i>We've been wondering</i>
<i>if you could call it.</i>

481
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,750
Oh.

482
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:18,799
What did she just do?!
What's going on?!

483
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,335
What an amazing level
of power.

484
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:25,005
( echoing )
Divine core manifestation,

485
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,173
mind meld established.

486
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,475
Power setting minimal.

487
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,012
Why have you summoned me,

488
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:35,115
you creatures
of the finite lifespans?

489
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:37,984
Exceed rank number one...

490
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:40,086
the Old Deus.

491
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:43,389
Exceed rank... one?

492
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,058
Old...

493
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,561
Old Deus!

494
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,331
Okay.

495
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:54,467
Sora and Shiro:
<i>Let the games begin.</i>
