1
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,820
I could not hate baths any more.

2
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,552
Hey, Shiro, how am I supposed
to wash you if you keep squirming?

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:12,355
Come on, sis, after all the
craziness that went down today,

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,238
I'd say a bath is definitely in order.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,178
Just go with it.

6
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:19,826
I hate taking baths 'cause it makes my hair stiff.

7
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:22,845
If that's the case, why don't you try some of my shampoo?

8
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:26,435
W‐where'd the hell'd you come from, Jibril?!

9
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,628
Suffering from tired, dried‐out hair?

10
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:33,776
Get soft, silky, flowing tresses with
Flugel's very own Spirit Water Blend.

11
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:40,719
And as a bonus, I, Jibril, your new slave, will
even throw in a free back scrubbing for my Masters.

12
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:43,209
Let me explore those hot alien bodies.

13
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:44,242
Shiro, watch out!

14
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:46,497
Her very existence is 18 and over!

15
00:00:46,615 --> 00:00:48,237
Jibril, wait.

16
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:49,792
Oh!

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,703
You just sit there and watch, naughty girl.

18
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:54,218
What? That's not fair.

19
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,965
The stupid steam's covering up all the good stuff.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,364
Look at that, already bossing her around like a pro.

21
00:00:59,389 --> 00:01:01,136
You've really made your big brother proud,

22
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,006
learning to crack the whip at such a young age.

23
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:06,429
I really hate the fact that I'm
starting to get used to this crap.

24
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,041
Uh, what in the world is this?

25
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,880
I prepared it for my Masters.

26
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:53,795
I do believe in your country they call a kitchen.

27
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,742
Um, excuse me, Steve.

28
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:56,624
It's Steph!

29
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,030
My name is Stephanie Dola.

30
00:02:58,055 --> 00:03:00,952
Well, "Dola" is ugly, and I
don't care for you much anyway,

31
00:03:00,977 --> 00:03:04,155
so I'm going to call you something
easier to remember like Dolly.

32
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,069
UGH! Dolly?!

33
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,556
By the way, I received a message from Sora.

34
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:11,677
"Looks like there's plenty of sugar and butter
here, so feel free to bake whatever you want."

35
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,011
Message ends.

36
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:14,714
Really?

37
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,606
Oh, think of all the desserts I can make with this.

38
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,832
Ohh! Hold on, that's just their backhanded
way of getting me to bake goodies for them.

39
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:24,763
Why do they always try to take
advantage of poor little me?

40
00:03:24,832 --> 00:03:26,968
But if it weren't for you, we would have lost.

41
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:28,078
Thanks a lot, Steph.

42
00:03:28,103 --> 00:03:29,928
I'm on it!

43
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,169
So this is how the lowly Imanity experience

44
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:34,228
that strange feeling called love, isn't it?

45
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:35,315
Huh? Love?

46
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,499
No, no, no, you're wrong!

47
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,304
I believe you were ordered to fall in love,

48
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,926
not stay in love... so what's the deal, Dolly?

49
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,809
Why do you still seem to be so affected by it, hmm?

50
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,765
At first, I thought you were useless,

51
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:49,456
but your clownish behavior is actually quite amusing.

52
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,316
Greetings, Kurami, I'm finally back.

53
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,373
You wanted some information, right?

54
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:02,669
Or was it food? Wait, I know.

55
00:04:02,694 --> 00:04:04,909
How about me?

56
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,190
Thanks, but I'll take my clothes first.

57
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,457
Mm, this is great.

58
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:15,428
We had that poor girl you beat in the tournament to thank.

59
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:18,289
Ever since she started enacting the new King's policies,

60
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:21,531
the quality of life in Elkia
has really started to improve.

61
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:25,017
Whatever. Little Princess. Hmph.

62
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:29,324
She's just the puppet of a puppet, and as
shameless as her grandfather was foolish.

63
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:32,421
I know you feel guilty for trying
to cheat her out of the kingdom,

64
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:36,010
and I know you've been working on an
apology when you didn't think I was watching.

65
00:04:36,062 --> 00:04:37,896
You're so adorable, Kurami.

66
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:41,908
Hey, how'd you, I mean, more importantly,
don't you have any intel to report?

67
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,243
Oh, well, this and that.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,949
It seems that the new King has somehow
acquired a Flugel as a personal slave

69
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,601
and he's really interested in the Eastern Federation.

70
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,127
I think that's about it.

71
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,595
All of that's true?

72
00:04:56,156 --> 00:05:00,953
Okay, maybe I got a little carried away,
but remember, it's for the sake of Imanity.

73
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:03,941
It definitely has nothing to do with being in love.

74
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,166
Now then, dear Jibril,

75
00:05:06,293 --> 00:05:09,240
tell me what you know about the Eastern Federation,

76
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:12,115
the sexy animal‐girl paradise we're about to conquer.

77
00:05:12,171 --> 00:05:14,658
Well, I guess this country's pretty much done for.

78
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,866
As you wish, my King.

79
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:21,735
The various Warbeast clans were
embroiled in the civil war for many years,

80
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,396
mostly due to physical differences,

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,632
but the shrine priestess put an end to
the battles in less than half a century.

82
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:30,866
The clans unified into a massive naval empire

83
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:34,686
and became the world's third‐largest
country, the Eastern Federation.

84
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:40,913
So, a land of cat girls, dog girls, fox girls,
rabbit girls, and all other kinds of animal girls,

85
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:42,774
and they'll all be mine.

86
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,991
All right, we must conquer them at once.

87
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:49,797
But to do that, we'll need to utilize all that precious
knowledge you've been collecting over the last millennia.

88
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:53,992
I am sorry, master, I doubt that would do much good.

89
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:59,221
Unfortunately, I can think of no path to victory
when it comes to facing the Eastern Federation.

90
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,645
Jibril, you don't mean that.

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,163
You're saying Blank can't win?

92
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:05,131
Not quite.

93
00:06:05,402 --> 00:06:08,929
What I mean is I won't be of
much help in forming your strategy.

94
00:06:09,088 --> 00:06:11,113
There was once a time where I, too,

95
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,299
fought the Eastern Federation... and lost.

96
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,287
That settles it.

97
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:20,044
I knew Elkia had another nation's support.

98
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:21,838
It must be the Warbeasts.

99
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:24,318
Okay, then, so what you think is going on?

100
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,082
You of all people should know.

101
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:32,937
On at least four occasions, Elven Gard challenged
the Eastern Federation, and lost each time.

102
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:38,317
Hmm... we might have won if the players
weren't those senile elders, but okay.

103
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,449
The point is, when I faced Blank, I lost,

104
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:44,299
and that means they were able
to overcome your Elven magic,

105
00:06:44,324 --> 00:06:46,047
and that Flugel was next.

106
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,736
In other words, they must be
using some sort of Warbeast sorcery

107
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,770
that even an Elf couldn't detect.

108
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,042
Are you sure?

109
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,825
That's gotta be it.

110
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:00,239
There's no way Imanity could beat a higher race by itself.

111
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,813
Don't underestimate humanity.

112
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,589
He's got some nerve.

113
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,910
So you and the Elves both got your asses handed to you?

114
00:07:13,206 --> 00:07:15,491
What the hell kind of game did you play anyway?

115
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,376
When setting the rules,

116
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:21,332
one of the Federation's conditions is that
the loser has their memories of the game erased.

117
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,158
Now do you understand what I mean?

118
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,813
Yeah, I get it, it's impossible.

119
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:27,653
What you mean it's impossible?

120
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,824
If they wipe your memories when you lose
and you have no recollection of the game,

121
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:34,711
how are you gonna adapt your strategy
the next time you challenge them?

122
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:37,427
To top it off, they can also read your mind?

123
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,564
How are we supposed to beat a race like that?

124
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,527
Don't be such a Steph, Steph.

125
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,346
It's pretty obvious.

126
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:45,887
Huh? No, wait a second.

127
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,153
It doesn't add up.

128
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,352
What doesn't?

129
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,212
Since trying to beat the Warbeasts is so pointless,

130
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:54,167
their enemies should eventually stop trying, right?

131
00:07:54,192 --> 00:07:56,654
It would be less painful that way for everyone.

132
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,418
That, dear sis, is why you suck at strategy games

133
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:01,691
despite being a little smarter than me.

134
00:08:02,032 --> 00:08:05,925
They've got some kind of slam‐dunk
method of beating Flugel and even Elves.

135
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,333
Why don't they pretend like they're vulnerable instead?

136
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,598
Then they'd lure the enemy in, give them a
healthy beat down, and snatch their land easy.

137
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,997
That play style is just... mean.

138
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,142
Appalled!

139
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,702
There is something weird about it, though.

140
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:22,260
How could they have expanded their
country so much in just half a century?

141
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,111
See? I told you it's strange!

142
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,044
Master, wait, I just thought of something.

143
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:27,902
I think I might be able to explain how that happened.

144
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,516
Oh, really now? Let's hear it.

145
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,391
I saw something in here somewhere.

146
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,013
Only one country has challenged the Eastern Federation

147
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,388
in the last ten years.

148
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:40,971
Only one? Who's dumb enough to do that?

149
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,528
Why don't I just show you? It'll be faster.

150
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:45,984
Come along, Dolly, you're going with us.

151
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,295
All right then, masters.

152
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,027
Hold on tight and don't let go.

153
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,681
Now then, if everyone is ready.

154
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,515
Wha‐what's going on?!

155
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,978
Wow, it's so nice and clear today.

156
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:13,471
J‐Jibril, what the heck did you just do?!

157
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:15,075
Ever hear of teleporting?

158
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:17,553
Right, I keep forgetting.

159
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,533
I'm living in a fantasy world now.

160
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,773
So how far can you teleport?

161
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,769
I can travel as far as I can see

162
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,119
and to any location I've visited before.

163
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,406
So a zoom spell.

164
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,528
How was poor little Imanity able to survive in a war

165
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:32,951
against a whole race full of monsters like her?

166
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,955
That's been the most perplexing
mystery in all our history.

167
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,974
Oh, I remember it like it was just yesterday.

168
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:45,346
The Dragonia, Giganto, and Old Deus all storming
the battlefield, 50 Flugel desperately fighting

169
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:47,142
to sever a single Dragon's head,

170
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,557
and then 200 of our finest facing a god in vain!

171
00:09:50,582 --> 00:09:52,663
Why, I can almost smell the blood.

172
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:55,307
Ah, yes, the good old days.

173
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:56,930
Have a look over there, master.

174
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:58,812
What I'm looking at here?

175
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:02,236
Some ugly high‐rise crapping up the fantasy landscape?

176
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,470
It's huge.

177
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,321
Oh, that's the Eastern Federation's Elkian embassy.

178
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,993
Well, that kind of seems like overkill, do you think?

179
00:10:09,018 --> 00:10:14,210
Actually, that used to be the Elkian palace,
but the Eastern Federation did a bit of remodeling.

180
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,688
Ah! Hey, hold on!

181
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:19,596
So that place used to be your palace? Why do they have it?

182
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,987
All starting to make sense now, Master?

183
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:25,754
In the last ten years, only one
country has challenged the Federation.

184
00:10:25,873 --> 00:10:28,367
Uh‐huh, and blew it, too.

185
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:31,450
Yeah. The challenger was Elkia.

186
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:35,718
You hanging in there, Sora?

187
00:10:35,743 --> 00:10:39,086
Yeah, sorry, just wallowing in despair, that's all.

188
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:39,929
UWAH!

189
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:44,457
Even the Elves gave up after four losses,
but Elkia challenged these guys eight times

190
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,880
and bet half its kingdom?

191
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:48,495
I'm starting to think that old King really was an idiot.

192
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:52,950
Hey, what was that? Weren't you the one that kept claiming
that he was right despite what everyone else said?

193
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:56,470
And thanks to his recklessness,
your territory got cut in half.

194
00:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,289
You expect me to defend that?

195
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,119
Can you just imagine all the industry and farming
we could have if the country still had all that land?

196
00:11:04,144 --> 00:11:06,446
Man, he was as hopeless as you are.

197
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,437
Did he just suck at getting lucky thinking if he
kept trying that eventually he might somehow win?

198
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:15,577
Okay, maybe it's true that my
grandfather wasn't good at games,

199
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:20,551
but he wasn't stupid enough to risk the three
million lives under his care unless he had a good reason.

200
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,156
The people came first!

201
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,166
Unlike the two of you, he was kind
and loving and reasonable at least.

202
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,249
Well, excuse me for being cruel and awful.

203
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:35,160
Heh. Besides, if throwing away half your shit qualifies
you as reasonable, that I'm happier being a jerk.

204
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,830
Eh, Maybe you're right and he was a good king,

205
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,922
But just a good king for a bunch of whiners
that won't take things into their own hands.

206
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,335
That's more likely.

207
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:46,061
Useless friggin' humans,

208
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,484
completely hopeless, every last one of them.

209
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:50,097
Huh?

210
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,944
You can go ahead and mock me, I don't care.

211
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,663
But don't insult my grandfather or what he believed in.

212
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,740
Hey, Steph, wait, come back!

213
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,147
Too far, way too far.

214
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,611
After finding out about this ridiculous state of affairs,

215
00:12:11,754 --> 00:12:13,304
how else should I react?

216
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:16,978
Hmm?

217
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:21,195
They're yummy.

218
00:12:27,076 --> 00:12:28,005
Damn.

219
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,037
They are good.

220
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:42,842
Um, Granddaddy, what's this key for?

221
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:46,872
Well, sweetie, it opens the lock to
something I've stored away that's very important.

222
00:12:46,897 --> 00:12:48,615
Oooh! I've heard about that!

223
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:51,298
So it's for your secret man books
that you can't show to other people?

224
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,395
No, no, my dear, that's something else.

225
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:54,359
I mean.

226
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:58,155
This key, this is a key of hope.

227
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,354
Hope, huh?

228
00:12:59,393 --> 00:13:01,872
Maybe someday, it will belong to you.

229
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,725
What do I do with it, Granddaddy?

230
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,027
I want you to find someone very special to give it to,

231
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,548
someone to whom you can entrust our kingdom,

232
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:13,457
someone who can carry the weight of Imanity's future.

233
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,907
Like hell I'm ever giving this to that stupid‐

234
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,511
Hey, there, you got a second?

235
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,843
What the heck are you doing here?!

236
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:29,520
Dolly, I highly recommend you
return to the library immediately.

237
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:31,024
What's going on now?

238
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:32,459
Though I came here on my own,

239
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,724
I feel your presence would benefit my Master.

240
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:36,369
However, I won't force you.

241
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:37,395
Huh?

242
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,938
This is so ridiculous. Like they even care about me.

243
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:52,376
Fine! I'll go!

244
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:08,370
Master, no matter how hard you look, I doubt you'll
find evidence to justify the King's foolish actions.

245
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:10,419
No, that's not what I'm looking for.

246
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:12,265
Something about this is bugging me, though.

247
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:15,830
You wouldn't happen to be looking for
clues to help Dolly feel better, now would you?

248
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,246
Look, I'm just reviewing all the info so I don't make

249
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:21,082
the same mistake on my animal‐girl‐kingdom conquest.

250
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:25,458
So anyway, why'd the former king
challenge the Federation eight times?

251
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:31,193
A reasonable man responsible for three million
people wouldn't just rush into defeat again and again.

252
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,467
Right here, isn't this the first
place he offered up as a wager?

253
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,795
That's an omatite mine, isn't it?

254
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:40,961
Even though it's a valuable metal, Imanity
doesn't have the technology to refine it,

255
00:14:40,961 --> 00:14:42,562
so it's worthless to us.

256
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:49,402
Then here's the second bet, then the third
bet, the fourth bet, and finally the eighth, here.

257
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:52,159
Up till the very last game when he bet the castle,

258
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,200
looks like he didn't wager anything of value.

259
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:57,745
Come on, I know we had a reason for it, but why?

260
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:58,641
Master?

261
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,058
Why wipe challengers' memories
when it only discourages them?

262
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,830
Why did Elven Gard challenge them four times?

263
00:15:04,855 --> 00:15:06,697
Why did the former king...

264
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:07,801
no, wait.

265
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,846
Maybe he stopped at eight 'cause maybe by the eighth time,

266
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,777
he actually achieved his goal.

267
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:17,264
There is no written proof, but what if the last King

268
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,162
didn't lose his memories after all?

269
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:23,070
Master, please don't take this as being rude,

270
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:28,513
but from what I've seen, not all Imanity act
with the same forethought and attention as you.

271
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,667
Not all, but I'm sure some of them do,

272
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:33,615
and most of the time, they're probably misunderstood.

273
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,856
Now is the new King, it's my
duty to try and understand them.

274
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,130
I know what you're thinking, how can I possibly believe

275
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:43,833
that an inferior race like humanity actually has a chance?

276
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,526
No, I wasn't thinking that at all.

277
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:47,036
The answer's simple, really.

278
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,507
If you want to know the truth,
I don't believe in humanity.

279
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:57,393
Humans are lowly and stupid creatures,
every single last one of them, including me.

280
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:59,244
They're all crap.

281
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,406
It doesn't matter what planet they're from,

282
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:03,242
this one or my old one.

283
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:06,339
Not a damn thing's changed a bit.

284
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,559
I...

285
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:12,599
I've heard enough.

286
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,286
However, I believe in humanity's potential.

287
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:21,109
If you need proof, it's right here.

288
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,508
This little human is the real deal.

289
00:16:24,464 --> 00:16:31,731
She's a shining example of our potential, our strength,
our hope, and our dreams that reach even beyond the gods.

290
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,852
I remember the first day we met.

291
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:36,070
It was almost eight years ago.

292
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,509
Back then, she was only three.

293
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:42,114
The first time she heard my
name, guess what her response was.

294
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:46,579
You seem so empty.

295
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:52,356
First off, she knew that my name meant sky,

296
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:56,298
and then she noticed that I was smiling
just 'cause everyone else in the room was.

297
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,577
A double entendre at three years old.

298
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,238
I was so pumped. This was it.

299
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:04,020
I found someone who was worth something.

300
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:05,601
Also...

301
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,693
I wanted to be like her or at least try.

302
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,234
You know, back in our old world,

303
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:15,839
humans can fly through the sky
and even travel amongst the stars.

304
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:18,064
Sorry, but that's kind of hard to believe.

305
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,578
Yeah, no kidding, even humanity
itself doubted any of that was possible,

306
00:17:22,684 --> 00:17:26,583
but someone eventually pulled it
off, the real deal, pulled it off.

307
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:31,100
That's why it's up to us to ensure
that the potential of the misunderstood

308
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,747
gets realized before it all goes to waste.

309
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:36,854
And that's the reason why I
need to start believing in him.

310
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,206
The former king was right.

311
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:52,649
Sora...

312
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:58,688
Huh?

313
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,438
I have something that I...

314
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,495
want to give you.

315
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,414
There's no doubt.

316
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,002
It's his porn.

317
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:11,487
I knew it!

318
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:14,681
But my dear Master, which door do you think it goes to?

319
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:17,365
People usually stash their porn in their own room.

320
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:18,984
So then, it's this one.

321
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:21,163
Actually, sis and I found it a long time ago.

322
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:21,601
Peace.

323
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:22,061
Huh?

324
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:25,938
Remember when I said this bed
was lopsided and hard to sleep on?

325
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,486
That was just the start of the puzzle.

326
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:31,455
With a little messing around here and there...

327
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:37,616
Ah, there you go, one secret room coming right up.

328
00:18:39,213 --> 00:18:41,288
I give up. I don't know anything.

329
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:45,626
Hmm.

330
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,640
I leave this in hopes that you will
not be Imanity's last king but rather

331
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,419
the one who restores it.

332
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:20,628
I admit, I am not a wise king.

333
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:24,879
In fact, I fully expect to be
remembered as one of the most foolish.

334
00:19:25,895 --> 00:19:27,554
But that is of no matter.

335
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:30,472
I take up this pen for the future King,

336
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:33,467
the one who will one day bring us to glory.

337
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:38,695
All I can do is trust that the story of my
pathetic and seemingly hopeless struggles...

338
00:19:38,956 --> 00:19:43,064
Will someday assist you in your quest as our next king.

339
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,425
I knew it.

340
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,801
The old king didn't have his memories erased after all.

341
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,424
Unlike the Elves, the Warbeasts knew
Imanity didn't stand a chance to win

342
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,363
and looked down on them as easy prey.

343
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:59,272
They didn't erase his memories
because they wanted him to keep trying.

344
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:01,966
Was that some way to lure him in?

345
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,812
They purposefully went easy on him to make
him think he could beat them the next time.

346
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:13,088
But still, the king knew that, and he challenged
them anyway hoping to figure out how their game worked.

347
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:17,752
He deliberately gave them useless land
that he'd eventually try to take back.

348
00:20:17,828 --> 00:20:22,669
So then if he played so many times, why didn't
he reveal the secrets of the game to anyone?

349
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,172
They probably made him take a pledge,

350
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:28,294
like he couldn't tell people as long as he lived.

351
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:30,663
So it was all for nothing?

352
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:31,528
Not quite.

353
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,056
Once he died, the pledge no longer applied.

354
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,972
He bet eight times,

355
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:40,180
but then he found a loophole in the pledges,

356
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:43,358
then entrusted that information to the next king.

357
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,377
Humanity's greatest gambler.

358
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:52,351
That's why he set up a gambling tournament to
find the next ruler, even if it ousted Steph.

359
00:20:52,726 --> 00:20:55,474
Your former King, he made a bet.

360
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:59,437
He bet that a human, someone from the lowest‐ranked race,

361
00:20:59,437 --> 00:21:01,695
would rise up and crush all the other races.

362
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:05,230
The possibility rests ever so close to naught.

363
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:08,877
However... it still remains.

364
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:11,509
Steph...

365
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:14,924
He just pretended to be a fool,

366
00:21:15,036 --> 00:21:17,480
lost the bets but kept trying.

367
00:21:17,767 --> 00:21:19,762
In reality, he was a great man

368
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:22,303
trying to save Imanity up until his death.

369
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:27,198
This is his trust in our people.

370
00:21:28,462 --> 00:21:30,591
You know what, Steph? Your old Gramps‐

371
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,347
no, sorry, I mean the former king...

372
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,298
he really was a great man after all.

373
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:41,689
Granddaddy!

374
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,018
Granddaddy!

375
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:50,661
Well, it sure is one hell of a task he threw at us.

376
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,307
Don't worry, Sora, you and I can do it.

377
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,987
See, Jibril? Not all humans are so bad.

378
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,220
What do you think?

379
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,427
You ready for this?

380
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,335
Yes, ready indeed, Master.

381
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:53,099
Eastern Federation, your head's gonna
look mighty nice on the end of this pike.
