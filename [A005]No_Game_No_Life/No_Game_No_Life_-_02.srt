1
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:05,303
What the heck is going on here?

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,652
Huh, what? this?

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,703
Well, in case you didn't catch on, we're
siblings, so don't get the wrong idea.

4
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:14,509
Oh, rejected by my own brother.

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,305
I don't care about your stupid relationship!

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:18,094
I'm asking you why you didn't call that girl out

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,650
if you knew she was totally trying to cheat me back there!

8
00:00:20,705 --> 00:00:22,851
Now I've blown my chance at ruling the kingdom!

9
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,433
Pledge eight states.

10
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,996
"Being caught cheating during a game
is grounds for an instant loss," right?

11
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,905
Yeah, duh! And now thanks to you,

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,497
some nobody is gonna take over my kingdom.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,322
My life is over!

14
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:37,748
So, basically.

15
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:41,147
She lost her match to the cheater, and she's a sore loser.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,396
She fell for it.

17
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,098
Let me get this straight.

18
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:46,408
You got totally hustled,

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,076
lost all your worldly possessions,

20
00:00:48,101 --> 00:00:50,388
and somehow that's supposed to be our fault?

21
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,762
Ha, whatever, toots.

22
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,595
What was that?!

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,672
Not only that, when you get called out on it,

24
00:00:54,703 --> 00:00:57,308
you completely flip out and
start yapping like a little dog.

25
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:58,755
Pull it together.

26
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,929
You're an emotional time bomb,
too unstable to think logically

27
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,784
and too scared to take any risks.

28
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:07,081
Let me ask you, does crazy run in your family?

29
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:09,876
Or are you just a natural loser?

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,983
Hmm...

31
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:16,186
You take that back, right... now.

32
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:16,989
Huh?

33
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:18,816
Say what you want about me,

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,047
but I will not tolerate such
insults against my grandfather!

35
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:23,955
You take that back this instant!

36
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:26,363
Well, I'm right about that explosive temper,

37
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,262
a foolish king and a foolish granddaughter.

38
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,225
I said that's enough!

39
00:01:35,372 --> 00:01:37,413
Then how about a game?

40
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,085
A game?

41
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:21,796
Yeah, aren't all conflicts
supposed to be resolved through games?

42
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,797
That's like this world's second rule, right?

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,173
So how's a game of rock‐paper‐scissors sound?

44
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:28,279
You want to play that?

45
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,173
Yeah, but one thing.

46
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,140
It's simple.

47
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,144
I'll only play paper.

48
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:38,606
So I can only win this game if I play paper.

49
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:45,613
But say I beat you at rock or scissors,
you'll lose, too, so it ends up being a tie.

50
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,458
Then what happens if we both play the same thing?

51
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:51,009
In that case, it still ends up being a tie,

52
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:55,591
but if you can play anything besides paper,
you can actually win. Easy enough for you?

53
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:57,341
Oh, I get it.

54
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,096
So that's the trick.

55
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:01,527
I'm in. So what are we betting?

56
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:03,085
How about if you win,

57
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:04,864
whatever you wish will be my command.

58
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:06,978
I'll tell you how you were cheated,

59
00:04:07,105 --> 00:04:11,086
and if you're still mad about me
dissing your stupid old grandfather so much

60
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,315
you can have us put to death.

61
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,254
Do what?!

62
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,144
But if I win the game,

63
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,552
you'll be on my leash, of course.

64
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,286
It's a high stakes game or
rock‐paper‐scissors with my life on the line.

65
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:22,787
Fair enough for you?

66
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,155
And if we tie?

67
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:28,039
Then I'll just give you a hint about our cheating methods.

68
00:04:28,086 --> 00:04:30,890
in exchange, you can do me a tiny favor.

69
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,487
I'm getting worried 'cause when this gold runs out,

70
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,715
we're more or less gonna be hobos on this planet.

71
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:39,622
So you're saying you want me to give you a place to stay.

72
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,045
Mmm...

73
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,197
Fine.

74
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,209
Then challenge excepted.

75
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:48,028
I swear by the pledges.

76
00:04:50,854 --> 00:04:52,397
Aschente! Aschente it is!

77
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,386
Ha! I'm not gonna fall for his trap that easily.

78
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,516
He might be trying to convince me
that his rules give me the advantage,

79
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:02,783
but there's still a one‐in‐three
chance that the game ends in a draw.

80
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:06,731
Basically, he's shooting for a
tie, so he wins a place to stay.

81
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:10,719
Sorry to disappoint you, smarty
pants, but victory won't come that easy.

82
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,053
Even with these rules if I just play rock

83
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,684
I have a two‐in‐three chance of winning.

84
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,377
Same as scissors, also a two‐in‐three chance.

85
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,300
But with paper, I only have a one‐in‐three chance to win,

86
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,335
So my best chance is throwing scissors or rock.

87
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:27,418
But since he said he'd only play paper,
that makes it more risky on my end to play rock,

88
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,064
which is the only way he can win.

89
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:32,019
In other words, he's trying to force me to play scissors.

90
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,037
Ha! So much for your genius ploy.

91
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,317
Did you really think I was stupid enough to fall for that?

92
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,020
I'll crush your plans and play rock!

93
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:45,249
No, wait a minute!

94
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:47,143
Let's think about this, Stephanie Dola.

95
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:50,339
There's a two‐in‐three chance I'll win if I play rock,

96
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:52,628
but there's also a one‐in‐three chance I'll lose.

97
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,456
So, wait a minute.

98
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:57,348
Unless he's totally lying, he said he'd only play paper.

99
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:01,199
So if he does, then he'll risk
a one‐in‐three chance of losing

100
00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:03,468
as well as a one‐in‐three chance of winning.

101
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,164
But if he doesn't, he'll have a two‐in‐three
chance of losing and absolutely no chance of winning.

102
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:12,777
Since that's the case, there shouldn't be
any reason for him to play anything else.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,089
It's obvious. He's got to pick... paper.

104
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:19,738
Ready? Here we go.

105
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:20,927
Yeah, I'm ready.

106
00:06:20,952 --> 00:06:23,192
One, two... But I hope

107
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,065
Shoot!

108
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:29,318
I'll admit, good try.

109
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:31,131
But not good enough.

110
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:34,528
You probably thought I was gonna
try to goad you into playing rock,

111
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,510
but once you saw my expression
you realized I couldn't win

112
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:39,404
unless I played anything but paper.

113
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:40,790
I'll give you that much.

114
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:43,588
You did actually end up blocking me from winning.

115
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,106
But still, your best bet would have been paper.

116
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:50,927
Yeah, but with scissors, I could double
my chances to win compared to paper.

117
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,511
Of course, that's how I knew
you'd end up picking scissors.

118
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:58,833
You were so busy trying to get inside my
head, you didn't think that I was in yours.

119
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:02,139
Otherwise, you would have wised
up and played paper for the win.

120
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:05,500
See, I told you‐ you're just not good enough.

121
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:10,808
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself,
the results were pretty much a given.

122
00:07:10,942 --> 00:07:12,824
Sorry, but you had no chance.

123
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,811
Fine, I get it.

124
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:16,106
You were trying to corner me into a tie.

125
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,474
I'll find you housing.

126
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:18,889
No, that's all right.

127
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,891
Hey, Sis, what did I say my prize would be?

128
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:24,321
If you won, she'd owe you a tiny favor.

129
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,435
And I said that favor was?

130
00:07:27,675 --> 00:07:28,462
Didn't say.

131
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,702
Oh, w‐wait a minute! That's not true!

132
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:34,690
I know I asked if you wanted a
place to stay before we started

133
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,176
Yep, but do you remember my response?

134
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:37,962
Uh...

135
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:42,666
No...

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,837
That's right. Those were my words, not his.

137
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,149
He just complained about money.

138
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,684
I guess you didn't notice, but this game's big catch

139
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,487
was that whether you lost or tied,

140
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:56,966
the risk was gonna be the same.

141
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:58,594
No fair! That's cheating!

142
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,812
Hey, I stuck to the rules of the
pledges when I laid the game out for you.

143
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,809
Why should I take blame if you didn't get it?

144
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,543
So since I'm sure you're wondering...

145
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,640
why don't I tell you the favor?

146
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:19,007
I want you...

147
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:20,825
...to love me!

148
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,604
Huh?

149
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:23,273
To love me!

150
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,098
To love me!

151
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:33,060
What do you think, Sis? Your
brother came up with the perfect plan!

152
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:37,326
Pledge number six‐ any bets made in
accordance with the pledges must be upheld.

153
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:42,140
All I have to do is make her fall in love with
me and we'd be in her palace and rolling in riches.

154
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:46,923
Uh, you could have had all of that if
you'd just said, "give me all of your stuff."

155
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:47,965
Say what?

156
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,850
Sora...

157
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,399
you succumbed to your desires.

158
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,067
I did what?

159
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,420
You mean after all the genius work I've put into my plan,

160
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:03,456
I was thwarted by my not‐so‐subconscious
fear of being a virgin the rest of my life?!

161
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,437
Even when faced against my mighty brain,
you're telling me, Little Sora, down in my pants...

162
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,130
But you said you never wanted a girlfriend.

163
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,887
Remember, you said all you needed was me.

164
00:09:13,694 --> 00:09:14,452
Shiro...

165
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:24,186
I was just trying to look cool
when I said that. It was a lie!

166
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,140
It's not like I can date my sister.

167
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:29,150
You're only 11, anyway. I'm a healthy and virile young man

168
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,693
and a man's got sexual needs and sexual needs

169
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:32,528
and sexual needs.

170
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:33,799
Did I mention sexual needs?

171
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,222
Yeah, you said it four times already.

172
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:38,065
I know the ten pledges are set in stone,

173
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,284
but... am I really jealous that he's
gushing over his sister and ignoring me?

174
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,881
I mean, we just met.

175
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:46,899
No! It's nonsense.

176
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:49,585
I'll never love you!

177
00:09:54,743 --> 00:09:55,529
Baby.

178
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:58,605
No way! There's no way I'm feeling this.

179
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,629
Falling in love is just some chemical imbalance, right?

180
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,250
It's just an illusion.

181
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,460
Come on, stay strong.

182
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:05,601
Fight it!

183
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,969
Fight the urges!

184
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,679
Hey, mind if I call you Steph, from now on?

185
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,036
That would be wonderful!

186
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:14,301
No, no, no, no, no, this isn't
right! What the hell is wrong with me?!

187
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:15,376
Uh, hey, Steph?

188
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,034
Uh‐huh?

189
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:17,838
Are you good with us staying in the palace?

190
00:10:17,877 --> 00:10:18,981
But, of course!

191
00:10:19,006 --> 00:10:22,256
Wow, those pledges really have a
hold on these people, don't they?

192
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,313
Sora?

193
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:23,766
Yo!

194
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,497
You're losing your virginity.

195
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,140
Congrats.

196
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:26,863
Uh...

197
00:10:29,152 --> 00:10:30,804
My cute body isn't ready for defiling.

198
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:32,538
...is happening in front of you!

199
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,006
Why? I'm cool with it.

200
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:35,840
Well, as your brother, I'm not!

201
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,288
One's, youth should be wholesome and healthy.

202
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,998
Why don't you see how healthy she is?

203
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,739
Accidental boob grab.

204
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,604
Nice move.

205
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,614
It was an accident!

206
00:10:57,454 --> 00:11:00,399
So soft, voluptuous.

207
00:11:00,788 --> 00:11:02,712
He's touching me!

208
00:11:02,903 --> 00:11:06,430
And now the moment we've all been waiting for...

209
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,272
The pantaloons.

210
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,401
Please, you have to...

211
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,104
get off me!

212
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:21,933
Oh, Sora! I'm sorry.

213
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:22,459
Are you okay?

214
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,699
I'm sorry. I swear, I'm really
sorry. I'll never touch boobs again.

215
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:28,401
I promise I'll never touch any
girl again. Please forgive me,

216
00:11:28,426 --> 00:11:32,452
I just thought this might be the only chance in
my life to ever lay hands on any boobies anywhere.

217
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,217
I mean, hentai games and oppai mousepads...

218
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:35,790
Did he get brain damaged or wh‐

219
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:37,205
Sora, where are you? Please don't leave me here.

220
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,721
I don't want to be alone. I'm scared.

221
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:40,997
Where did you go? You can't
abandon me in this scary place.

222
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:42,288
Please, Sora, where are you?

223
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:43,869
You've got to be kidding me.

224
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,413
This is what happens when you
two are apart from each other?

225
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:48,232
A couple of weirdos.

226
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,376
Sora!

227
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,682
Shiro!

228
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:52,870
Hug!

229
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,874
Okay, I'm done. You two are freaks.

230
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,141
So you're like aliens or something?

231
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:01,635
Yep.

232
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,296
Then that's why you're trying

233
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:07,306
You don't think it's weird
that we came from another planet?

234
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:11,747
I know there's magic and sorcery and other
stuff like that, so anything's possible, really.

235
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,099
This really is a fantasy world.

236
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:15,847
But I guess my real question is,

237
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,475
is this how your people normally take baths?

238
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,274
Well, Shiro's not a huge fan of baths.
She hates taking them 'cause she says

239
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,476
the Pedo Police will take me away for watching her.

240
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:27,335
That's why we invited our good old friend

241
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,059
Mr. Steam to help out.

242
00:12:29,084 --> 00:12:30,617
No pervs allowed, Sora.

243
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:34,153
If you know it makes her uncomfortable,
then why don't you just wait outside?

244
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:36,933
Obviously, we can't be too far apart from each other.

245
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,521
So Mr. Steam comes in very handy.

246
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,478
But don't despair, Steph,

247
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,052
I'll be sure to check out your boobage.

248
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:44,941
Oopsie!

249
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,919
Heya, Steph, my hand's all slippery!

250
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,286
Mind picking that up for me?

251
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,225
Uh... what is it?

252
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,576
Oh, it's just a secret tool from another world.

253
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,007
A secret tool?

254
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,805
Oh!

255
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,521
As long as Steph grabs the phone first, I
can check out her naughty nudey nakedness

256
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:03,627
without Shiro getting in the shot!

257
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:06,798
What's going on?

258
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:07,660
Did you grab it?

259
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:08,672
Yeah...

260
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:12,026
Perfect view, too. Pew pew.

261
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,369
It's hard to move in, and it's so frilly.

262
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:18,907
I used to wear that all the
time back when I was a little kid.

263
00:13:19,303 --> 00:13:20,788
Perfect fit, huh?

264
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:26,938
It's a bit formal for my taste, but it's kind
of like cosplay, so I guess that's cool, right?

265
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,814
My butler fantasy!

266
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,261
You look exquisite, Steph, ravishing.

267
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,570
Oh, you.

268
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:35,383
Huh?!

269
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,283
Don't be such an idiot!

270
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,419
What the heck is her problem, anyway?

271
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,246
Maybe herself?

272
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:45,490
I'll be right back. Better go make some tea!

273
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:49,819
That was really weird.

274
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:52,525
Sora, you really don't get girls, do you?

275
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,017
Um, Miss, wait.

276
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,455
Hold on, Miss. Perhaps, you should let us make the tea?

277
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,908
Don't worry about me!

278
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,699
Um, Ma'am, why are you dressed like a hobo?

279
00:14:00,724 --> 00:14:02,921
Maybe she's sick. Call a doctor!

280
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:06,797
Simply delicious. You're quite
the cook, aren't you, sweet cheeks?

281
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:09,453
Sora, you should totally marry her.

282
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,130
Huh, your wife?!

283
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:13,769
Oh, my, I'm embarrassed!

284
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,150
Miss Dola no!

285
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:16,705
Please stop!

286
00:14:16,896 --> 00:14:19,239
Okay, keep your wits about you, Stephanie Dola.

287
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:22,997
You can't let him undo you with his unworldly wiles.

288
00:14:23,584 --> 00:14:25,571
I'm sorry if I kept you waiting.

289
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:26,175
What the?

290
00:14:27,373 --> 00:14:28,464
Sora?

291
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:30,069
Uh...

292
00:14:46,112 --> 00:14:50,480
You'd never guess there's a tournament to
find the next king by the looks of this place.

293
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,092
It's like a ghost town.

294
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,451
Hm?

295
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,771
So what the hell language is that?

296
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,639
Not sure.

297
00:14:56,664 --> 00:14:57,854
It's a real Imanity.

298
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:02,835
There used to be a time when Elkia was
the largest of all the Imanity nations.

299
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:04,471
And what's Imanity?

300
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:05,909
That's the human race.

301
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,268
Oh, so, us?

302
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,674
Imanity once had many nations,

303
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,884
and they were spread all throughout the world,

304
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:16,109
But many of them are already dying out
by the time my grandfather took power.

305
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:17,990
Now there is only Elkia.

306
00:15:18,373 --> 00:15:23,389
It's gotten to the point where we have to gamble our
territories in hopes of gaining even just a little ground.

307
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:25,697
Then who else is there to play against,

308
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:28,827
something other than humans or Imanity or whatever?

309
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,210
Yes, exactly.

310
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:32,663
So other aliens like us, or what?

311
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,198
Well, let's see.

312
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:39,663
There are a total of 16 sentient races
that must abide by God's ten sacred pledges.

313
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:44,574
Collectively, we just refer to all the
races as The Exceed to keep it simple.

314
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,417
The first order is the Old Deus

315
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:47,848
who were defeated by the One God.

316
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,216
The Phantasma are the second order
and The Elementals are the third.

317
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,594
Skipping to the seventh order, we
have the Elves, who are great at magic

318
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:56,873
and comprise the world's largest nation.

319
00:15:57,158 --> 00:16:00,376
On the lower end, we have the Warbeasts at number 14,

320
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,490
and The Sirens at the 15th...

321
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:02,221
Hold on a second.

322
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:04,652
What's up with the all this order business?

323
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,302
It's like a ranking system.

324
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:07,728
From what I've been told,

325
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,134
it's determined by a race's affinity for magic.

326
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,317
And what about Imanity?

327
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:15,885
Well, we're at 16.

328
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,585
Dead last, huh?

329
00:16:17,717 --> 00:16:19,095
That's just the way it is.

330
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,001
We have zero magical abilities.

331
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,835
Zero? So Imanity can't use magic?

332
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:26,388
Right, unlike the other races,

333
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:31,132
Imanity lacks the Spirit Circuits that would
allow us to connect to the source of all magic.

334
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,487
And what's worse than that,

335
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:36,450
we can't even tell if someone else is using magic or not.

336
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:39,008
So you think you can't win.

337
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,099
Well, you know what they call that, don't you?

338
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:44,021
A self‐fulfilling prophecy.

339
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:44,820
Huh?

340
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,509
Hey, Steph, any libraries around here?

341
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,441
Uh, well, there's a bunch of books in the study.

342
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,537
However...

343
00:16:52,954 --> 00:16:54,823
They're all in Imanity.

344
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,804
We'll just have to learn it then, won't we?

345
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,193
Yeah, I guess so.

346
00:16:58,524 --> 00:16:59,275
Sora?

347
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,949
Huh?

348
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:02,915
I learned it.

349
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:03,238
Huh?

350
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,067
That was fast.

351
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:05,075
Praise me more.

352
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,716
Yeah, way to go, Little Sis.

353
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:07,467
She learned it?

354
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:08,573
You make me so proud of you, you tiny little genius.

355
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:09,369
She's gotta be joking, right?

356
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,637
She really learned the entire language that fast?

357
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:12,768
Yeah, so what?

358
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:13,776
But that's impossible.

359
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,275
It's only been like five minutes.

360
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:18,303
Since your spoken language is the same as ours, it's easy.

361
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:19,662
Catch up, Sora.

362
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,346
Huh, a man should take his
time, instead of finishing quickly.

363
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,347
This... is totally insane.

364
00:17:23,562 --> 00:17:25,558
My, how very small of you, Brother.

365
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,877
No weiner jokes!

366
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:28,753
His rock‐paper‐scissors scheming,

367
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,407
her genius level intelligence, solid teamwork,

368
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:34,291
complete trust and confidence...

369
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,640
You think you're so special...

370
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,612
then it's possible that these two...

371
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,361
...that these two could be the ones to save Elkia!

372
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,941
And the victor of this match is Kurami Zell!

373
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,915
Steph, what made you want to rule Elkia?

374
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,098
Huh?

375
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,964
I stayed up all night reading all these books.

376
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:10,230
I've learned a lot about this kingdom
and your grandfather and his whole story.

377
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,208
Oh.

378
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:14,210
Were you scared of losing your status in the royal family?

379
00:18:14,478 --> 00:18:15,945
No, not really.

380
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,017
Then it was Elkia you wanted to save.

381
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,272
That's pretty much it.

382
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,314
Of course I have other reasons.

383
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:26,701
In any case, my grandfather was
forced to gamble our country's territory,

384
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:27,794
but he kept losing.

385
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,105
Hence his title, "The Foolish King."

386
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:34,739
But despite people resenting him, my
grandfather believed in the potential of Imanity.

387
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:38,230
He didn't care we were the lowest
ranked or that we can't use magic,

388
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,931
He believed that if we tried
hard enough, we could win somehow.

389
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:45,712
I want to show the world that my
grandfather wasn't just some old fool.

390
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,455
If I can become king, then I can take our territory back.

391
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,656
Then I can prove to everyone
that my grandfather was right,

392
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:54,190
that we can win.

393
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:59,624
Tell me, Steph, do you love this country,

394
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:00,721
this world?

395
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:03,692
Yeah...

396
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,044
with all of my heart.

397
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:09,803
Wow, nice.

398
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm kind of jealous you can say that with such conviction,

399
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:18,071
but... there's no way that wish is coming true.

400
00:19:21,342 --> 00:19:23,089
In fact, as it stands,

401
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,296
this country is already doomed.

402
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,554
Once the next king takes the throne,

403
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:29,814
it's all over.

404
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:38,770
Uh, Kurami?

405
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:42,773
So it's time for the coronation already, huh?

406
00:19:45,235 --> 00:19:47,137
Well, well, Princess,

407
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:50,448
don't tell me you've been dressing
in bed sheets ever since I beat you.

408
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:55,760
I believe I heard you say this was the dress that
your beloved grandfather gave you before he died.

409
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:58,137
Here, I don't need it.

410
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,473
Oops.

411
00:20:08,434 --> 00:20:11,150
Just face it, you lost, so move on.

412
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:14,781
It would be wise if you didn't make the same mistakes

413
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:17,227
as the fool who gave you that dress.

414
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,898
You know, if you keep acting like
that you're only gonna prove her right.

415
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:34,055
In case you hadn't noticed, the game's already started.

416
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,008
Sora?

417
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,536
I'm sure you know pledge six‐

418
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:48,182
all bets made in accordance
with the pledges must be upheld.

419
00:20:48,752 --> 00:20:50,206
So this dress is yours.

420
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:53,457
But just for a while, okay?

421
00:20:54,927 --> 00:20:57,302
Looks like the granddaughter of The Foolish King

422
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,962
has inherited some fools for servants, too.

423
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:11,962
Hey, Shiro?

424
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:12,485
Mm?

425
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,783
You're gonna stick by your bro no matter what happens?

426
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:16,636
Mm.

427
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,526
Just like I promised, I'll follow you anywhere.

428
00:21:20,807 --> 00:21:22,109
That's a good answer!

429
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:23,720
This is a pretty miserable situation, so‐

430
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:26,127
Liar, you know you're loving this.

431
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:31,092
Well, it sure beats sitting at home and now you
can't say I don't take you anywhere fun, right?

432
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:34,397
Hey, Steph, you just gonna sit there forever?

433
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,584
Come on, you want to win that
dress back from her, don't you?

434
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:39,316
Let's get going. Hurry.

435
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:40,246
Uh...

436
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:41,660
You ready?

437
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,185
But where?

438
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,658
We're going to prove that your
grandfather wasn't the fool people thought.

439
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,897
Huh? Sora!

440
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,115
What's going on?

441
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:56,707
I'm not just having another fantasy, am I?

442
00:21:57,427 --> 00:21:59,962
Oh, I almost forgot. Thanks, Steph.

443
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,720
Those cookies were great, nice work.

444
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,355
Yum!

445
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:06,597
I'm so glad you liked them!

446
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,477
What's next?

447
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:15,789
I don't know.

448
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:18,085
Being king might be fun.

449
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,701
You still like your sheet dress, Steph?

450
00:23:50,726 --> 00:23:52,240
I never liked it!
