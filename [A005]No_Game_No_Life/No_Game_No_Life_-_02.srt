1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:06,039
What the heck
is going on here?

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,273
Huh, what? this?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,975
Well, in case
you didn't catch on,

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,945
we're siblings,
so don't get the wrong idea.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,181
Oh, rejected
by my own brother.

6
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,783
I don't care about
your stupid relationship!

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,652
I'm asking you why
you didn't call that girl out

8
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,287
if you knew she was totally
trying to cheat me back there!

9
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,690
Now I've blown my chance
at ruling the kingdom!

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,025
Pledge eight states‐

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,527
"Being caught cheating
during a game

12
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,529
is grounds for
an instant loss," right?

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,330
Yeah, duh!
And now thanks to you,

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,099
<i>some nobody is gonna</i>
<i>take over my kingdom.</i>

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,201
<i>My life is over!</i>

16
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,471
So, basically‐

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,674
Shiro:
She lost her match
to the cheater,

18
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>and she's a sore loser.</i>

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,477
Sora:
<i>She fell for it.</i>

20
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,846
Sora:
Let me get this straight.

21
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,013
You got totally hustled,

22
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,715
lost all your worldly
possessions,

23
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,084
and somehow that's supposed
to be our fault?

24
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,153
What was that?!
Ha, whatever, toots.

25
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,355
Not only that,
when you get called out on it,

26
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,256
you completely flip out

27
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,024
and start yapping
like a little dog.

28
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,392
Pull it together.

29
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,894
<i>You're an emotional time bomb,</i>

30
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,462
<i>too unstable</i>
<i>to think logically</i>

31
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,330
<i>and too scared</i>
<i>to take any risks.</i>

32
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,868
Let me ask you,
does crazy run in your family?

33
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,604
<i>Or are you just</i>
<i>a natural loser?</i>

34
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:12,973
( sobs )

35
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:13,674
Hmm...

36
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:16,877
You take that back,
right... now.

37
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,211
Huh?

38
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,445
Say what you want about me,

39
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:22,482
but I will not tolerate such
insults against my grandfather!

40
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,551
You take that back
this instant!

41
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,787
Well, I'm right about
that explosive temper,

42
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,656
a foolish king
and a foolish granddaughter.

43
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,558
Stephanie:
I said that's enough!

44
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,493
( claps )

45
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,999
Then how about a game?

46
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:41,835
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

47
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:13,860
A game?

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,228
Yeah,
aren't all conflicts

49
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,330
supposed to be resolved
through games?

50
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,365
That's like this world's
second rule, right?

51
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,368
So how's a game
of rock‐paper‐scissors sound?

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,904
You want to play that?

53
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,839
Yeah, but one thing.

54
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,141
It's simple.

55
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,810
I'll only play paper.

56
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,811
(gasps)

57
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:34,347
So I can only win this game
if I play paper.

58
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,583
( trumpet fanfare )

59
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,585
<i>But say I beat you</i>
<i>at rock or scissors,</i>

60
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,622
<i>you'll lose, too,</i>
<i>so it ends up being a tie.</i>

61
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,924
Stephanie:
<i>Then what happens if we both</i>
<i>play the same thing?</i>

62
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:46,426
Sora:
<i>In that case,</i>
<i>it still ends up being a tie,</i>

63
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,595
<i>but if you can play</i>
<i>anything besides paper,</i>

64
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,364
<i>you can actually win.</i>
<i>Easy enough for you?</i>

65
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,635
Stephanie:
Oh, I get it.
So that's the trick.

66
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:57,337
I'm in.
So what are we betting?

67
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,605
How about if you win,

68
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,674
whatever you wish
will be my command.

69
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,442
I'll tell you how
you were cheated,

70
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,610
and if you're still mad

71
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,513
about me dissing your
stupid old grandfather so much

72
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:07,981
you can have us put to death.

73
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,049
Do what?!

74
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,517
But if I win the game,

75
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,953
you'll be on my leash,
of course.

76
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,421
It's a high stakes game
or rock‐paper‐scissors

77
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,023
with my life on the line.

78
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,525
<i>Fair enough for you?</i>

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,661
And if we tie?

80
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,496
Then I'll just give you a hint
about our cheating methods.

81
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,633
in exchange,
you can do me a tiny favor.

82
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm getting worried
'cause when this gold runs out,

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,573
we're more or less gonna
be hobos on this planet.

84
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,208
So you're saying you want me
to give you a place to stay.

85
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,177
Mmm...

86
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,378
Fine.

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,582
Then challenge excepted.

88
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,550
I swear by the pledges.

89
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,088
Aschente!
Aschente it is!

90
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,858
Stephanie:
<i>Ha! I'm not gonna fall</i>
<i>for his trap that easily.</i>

91
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,326
<i>He might be trying</i>
<i>to convince me</i>

92
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,761
<i>that his rules give me</i>
<i>the advantage,</i>

93
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,597
<i>but there's still</i>
<i>a one‐in‐three chance</i>

94
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,165
<i>that the game</i>
<i>ends in a draw.</i>

95
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,601
<i>Basically,</i>
<i>he's shooting for a tie,</i>

96
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,503
<i>so he wins</i>
<i>a place to stay.</i>

97
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,437
<i>Sorry to disappoint you,</i>
<i>smarty pants,</i>

98
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,439
<i>but victory won't come</i>
<i>that easy.</i>

99
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,408
<i>Even with these rules</i>
<i>if I just play rock</i>

100
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,076
<i>I have a two‐in‐three chance</i>
<i>of winning.</i>

101
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,746
<i>Same as scissors,</i>
<i>also a two‐in‐three chance.</i>

102
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,816
<i>But with paper, I only have</i>
<i>a one‐in‐three chance to win,</i>

103
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,619
<i>So my best chance is throwing</i>
<i>scissors or rock.</i>

104
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,554
<i>But since he said</i>
<i>he'd only play paper,</i>

105
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,789
<i>that makes it more risky</i>
<i>on my end to play rock,</i>

106
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,858
<i>which is the only way</i>
<i>he can win.</i>

107
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:25,358
<i>In other words,</i>

108
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,393
<i>he's trying to force me</i>
<i>to play scissors.</i>

109
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,564
<i>Ha! So much</i>
<i>for your genius ploy.</i>

110
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,799
<i>Did you really think I was</i>
<i>stupid enough to fall for that?</i>

111
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,737
<i>I'll crush your plans</i>
<i>and play rock!</i>

112
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,707
<i>No, wait a minute!</i>

113
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,809
<i>Let's think about this,</i>
<i>Stephanie Dola.</i>

114
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,579
<i>There's a two‐in‐three chance</i>
<i>I'll win if I play rock,</i>

115
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,414
<i>but there's also a one‐in‐three</i>
<i>chance I'll lose.</i>

116
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,883
<i>So, wait a minute.</i>

117
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,053
<i>Unless he's totally lying,</i>
<i>he said he'd only play paper.</i>

118
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,521
<i>So if he does,</i>

119
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,523
<i>then he'll risk a one‐in‐three</i>
<i>chance of losing</i>

120
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,159
<i>as well as a one‐in‐three</i>
<i>chance of winning.</i>

121
00:05:59,159 --> 00:05:59,793
<i>But if he doesn't,</i>

122
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,562
<i>he'll have a two‐in‐three</i>
<i>chance of losing</i>

123
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,830
<i>and absolutely no chance</i>
<i>of winning.</i>

124
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,600
<i>Since that's the case,</i>
<i>there shouldn't be any reason</i>

125
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,502
<i>for him to play anything else.</i>

126
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:12,773
<i>It's obvious.</i>
<i>He's got to pick... paper.</i>

127
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,109
Ready? Here we go.
Yeah, I'm ready.

128
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,912
Sora:
One, two...
Stephanie:
But I hope

129
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,113
Sora:
Shoot!

130
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,118
( whimpers )
I'll admit, good try.

131
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,920
But not good enough.

132
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,922
You probably thought
I was gonna try to goad you

133
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:31,558
<i>into playing rock,</i>
<i>but once you saw my expression</i>

134
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,859
<i>you realized I couldn't win</i>

135
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,095
<i>unless I played</i>
<i>anything but paper.</i>

136
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:36,129
<i>I'll give you that much.</i>

137
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,800
<i>You did actually end up</i>
<i>blocking me from winning.</i>

138
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,503
But still, your best bet
would have been paper.

139
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:45,105
Yeah, but with scissors,
I could double my chances

140
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,239
to win compared to paper.

141
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:50,511
Of course, that's how I knew
you'd end up picking scissors.

142
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,679
You were so busy trying
to get inside my head,

143
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,347
you didn't think that
I was in yours.

144
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,149
Otherwise, you would
have wised up

145
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,718
and played paper
for the win.

146
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,555
See, I told you‐
you're just not good enough.

147
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,525
<i>Oh, don't be so hard</i>
<i>on yourself,</i>

148
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,326
<i>the results were pretty</i>
<i>much a given.</i>

149
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,361
Sorry,
but you had no chance.

150
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,395
Fine, I get it.

151
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,632
You were trying to
corner me into a tie.

152
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,066
I'll find you housing.

153
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,168
No, that's all right.

154
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,203
Hey, Sis, what did I say
my prize would be?

155
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,373
Shiro:
If you won,
she'd owe you a tiny favor.

156
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,509
And I said that favor was?

157
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:23,977
Didn't say.

158
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,113
Oh, w‐wait a minute!
That's not true!

159
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,215
<i>I know I asked if</i>
<i>you wanted a place to stay</i>

160
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,416
<i>before we started</i>

161
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,919
Yep, but do you remember
my response?

162
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,954
Uh...

163
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,156
( gasps )

164
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,525
No...

165
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,729
That's right.
Those were my words, not his.

166
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,132
<i>He just complained</i>
<i>about money.</i>

167
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,035
I guess you didn't notice,
but this game's big catch

168
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,871
was that whether
you lost or tied,

169
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,372
the risk was gonna
be the same.

170
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,874
No fair!
That's cheating!

171
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,709
Hey, I stuck to the rules
of the pledges

172
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,811
when I laid the game
out for you.

173
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,481
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Why should I take blame</i>
<i>if you didn't get it?</i>

174
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,751
So since I'm sure
you're wondering...

175
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:07,487
(menacing)
why don't I
tell you the favor?

176
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,761
<i>I want you...</i>

177
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,262
...to love me!

178
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,999
Huh?
<i>( echoes )</i>
<i>To love me!</i>

179
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,967
<i>To love me!</i>

180
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,403
( laughs )

181
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:25,471
( cackles )

182
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,206
What do you think, Sis?

183
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:28,642
Your brother came up
with the perfect plan!

184
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,744
Pledge number six‐
any bets made in accordance

185
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,913
with the pledges
must be upheld.

186
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,848
All I have to do is make
her fall in love with me

187
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,718
and we'd be in her palace
and rolling in riches.

188
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,653
Uh, you could
have had all of that

189
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,956
if you'd just said,
"give me all of your stuff."

190
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,224
Say what?

191
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,893
Shiro:
Sora...

192
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,662
you succumbed
to your desires.

193
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,931
( stammers )
I did what?

194
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:52,766
( shouts )

195
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,068
You mean after all the genius
work I've put into my plan,

196
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,970
I was thwarted by
my not‐so‐subconscious fear

197
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,905
of being a virgin
the rest of my life?!

198
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,607
Even when faced against
my mighty brain,

199
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,175
you're telling me,
Little Sora, down in my pants...

200
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,612
But you said you never
wanted a girlfriend.

201
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,715
Remember, you said
all you needed was me.

202
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,717
Shiro...

203
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,356
( groans )

204
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,525
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>I was just trying to look cool</i>
<i>when I said that.</i>

205
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,960
<i>It was a lie!</i>

206
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,628
<i>It's not like</i>
<i>I can date my sister.</i>

207
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,663
<i>You're only 11, anyway.</i>

208
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,264
<i>I'm a healthy</i>
<i>and virile young man</i>

209
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,800
<i>and a man's got sexual needs</i>
<i>and sexual needs</i>

210
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,901
<i>AND sexual needs.</i>

211
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,102
<i>Did I mention sexual needs?</i>

212
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,672
Shiro:
<i>Yeah, you said it four times</i>
<i>already.</i>

213
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,206
Steph:
<i>I know the ten pledges are set</i>
<i>in stone,</i>

214
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,809
<i>but... am I really jealous</i>
<i>that he's gushing</i>

215
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,744
<i>over his sister</i>
<i>and ignoring me?</i>

216
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,713
I mean, we just met.

217
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,448
No! It's nonsense.

218
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,652
( shouts )
I'll never love you!

219
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:48,488
( growls )

220
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,391
Sora:
<i>( chuckles ) Baby.</i>

221
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,327
( screams )
No way! There's no way
I'm feeling this.

222
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,396
Falling in love is just
some chemical imbalance, right?

223
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,564
It's just an illusion.

224
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:58,799
( screams and sobs )

225
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,867
<i>Come on, stay strong.</i>
<i>(gravelly) Fight it!</i>

226
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,235
<i>Fight the urges!</i>

227
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:05,405
Sora:
Hey, mind if I call you
Steph, from now on?

228
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,640
That would be wonderful!

229
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,241
No, no, no, no, no,
this isn't right!

230
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,910
What the hell
is wrong with me?!
(screams)

231
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,011
Uh, hey, Steph?
Uh‐huh?

232
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,346
Are you good with us
staying in the palace?

233
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,548
But, of course!
( sobs )

234
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,583
Wow, those pledges
really have a hold

235
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,251
on these people,
don't they?

236
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,019
Sora?
Yo!

237
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,655
You're losing your virginity.
Congrats.

238
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,656
Uh...
( gasps )

239
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,660
My cute body isn't ready
for defiling.

240
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,661
...is happening
in front of you!

241
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,663
( gasps )
Shiro:
Why? I'm cool with it.

242
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,097
Well, as your brother,
I'm not!

243
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:33,399
One's, youth should be
wholesome and healthy.

244
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,469
Shiro:
Why don't you see
how healthy she is?

245
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,639
( groans )

246
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,006
(thud)

247
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,313
Accidental boob grab.
Nice move.

248
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,349
It was an accident!

249
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:52,686
(surprised moan)

250
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:56,122
<i>So soft, voluptuous.</i>

251
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,658
Steph:
<i>(irritated)</i>
<i>He's touching me!</i>

252
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:01,828
Shiro:
<i>And now the moment we've all</i>
<i>been waiting for...</i>

253
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,830
Sora:
(deep tone)
<i>The pantaloons.</i>

254
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,067
( whimpers )
Please, you have to...

255
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,770
(screaming)
get off me!

256
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:14,240
( panting )

257
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,444
Stephanie:
Oh, Sora! I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Sora:

258
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,047
I swear, I'm really sorry.
I'll never touch boobs again.

259
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,984
I promise I'll never touch any
girl again. Please forgive me,

260
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,786
I just thought this might be
the only chance in my life

261
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,954
to ever lay hands
on any boobies anywhere.

262
00:11:27,954 --> 00:11:29,723
I mean, hentai games
and oppai mousepads...

263
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,124
Did he get brain damaged
or wh‐ ( screams )

264
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:32,626
Sora, where are you?
Please don't leave me here.

265
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,027
I don't want to be alone.
I'm scared.

266
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,663
Where did you go? You can't
abandon me in this scary place.

267
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,864
Please, Sora,
where are you?

268
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,132
You've got to be kidding me.

269
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,433
This is what happens
when you two

270
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,868
are apart from each other?

271
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,704
A couple of weirdos.

272
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,271
Sora!

273
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,373
Shiro!

274
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,875
Both:
Hug!

275
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,712
Okay, I'm done.
You two are freaks.

276
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,219
Steph:
So you're like
aliens or something?

277
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,388
Sora:
Yep.
(Stephanie)
Then that's why you're trying

278
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,691
Shiro:
You don't think
it's weird that we came

279
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,391
from another planet?

280
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,160
Stephanie:
I know there's magic
and sorcery

281
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,030
and other stuff like that,
so anything's possible, really.

282
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,498
Sora: <i>This really</i>
<i>is a fantasy world.</i>

283
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,434
But I guess
my real question is,

284
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,469
is this how your people
normally take baths?

285
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,172
Sora:
<i>Well, Shiro's not</i>
<i>a huge fan of baths.</i>

286
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,441
<i>She hates taking them</i>
<i>'cause she says</i>

287
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,910
<i>the Pedo Police will take me</i>
<i>away for watching her.</i>

288
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,579
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>That's why we invited</i>
<i>our good old friend</i>

289
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,581
<i>Mr. Steam to help out.</i>

290
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,115
No pervs allowed,
Sora.

291
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,051
Stephanie:
If you know
it makes her uncomfortable,

292
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,285
then why don't you just
wait outside?

293
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,556
Obviously, we can't be
too far apart from each other.

294
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,224
So Mr. Steam comes
in very handy.

295
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,726
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>But don't despair, Steph,</i>

296
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,696
<i>I'll be sure to check out</i>
<i>your boobage.</i>

297
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:43,363
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>Oopsie!</i>

298
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,232
<i>Heya, Steph,</i>
<i>my hand's all slippery!</i>

299
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,634
<i>Mind picking that up for me?</i>

300
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,536
Stephanie:
Uh... what is it?

301
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,305
Oh, it's just a secret tool
from another world.

302
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,574
A secret tool?

303
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,875
Shiro:
Oh!

304
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,342
Sora:
<i>( chuckles )</i>

305
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,078
<i>As long as Steph grabs</i>
<i>the phone first,</i>

306
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,880
<i>I can check out her naughty</i>
<i>nudey nakedness</i>

307
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,248
<i>without Shiro getting</i>
<i>in the shot!</i>

308
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,019
What's going on?
Did you grab it?
(screams)

309
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,491
Stephanie:
Yeah...
Shiro:
Perfect view, too. Pew pew.

310
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,728
It's hard to move in,
and it's so frilly.

311
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:15,829
I used to wear that
all the time

312
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,764
back when I was
a little kid.

313
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,499
Perfect fit, huh?

314
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,500
( gasps )

315
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,302
Sora:
It's a bit formal
for my taste,

316
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,338
but it's kind of like cosplay,
so I guess that's cool, right?

317
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,707
( chuckles )

318
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,941
My butler fantasy!

319
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:31,177
You look exquisite,
Steph, ravishing.

320
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,412
Oh, you.

321
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,313
(pop)

322
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:33,880
Huh?!

323
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,481
Don't be such an idiot!

324
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,018
Sora:
What the heck is
her problem, anyway?

325
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,686
Shiro:
Maybe herself?

326
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,421
( screams )

327
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:44,858
I'll be right back.
Better go make some tea!
(giggle)

328
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,426
<i>( door slams )</i>

329
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:48,294
That was really weird.

330
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,264
Sora, you really don't
get girls, do you?

331
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:53,366
Um, Miss, wait.
Hold on, Miss.

332
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,569
Perhaps, you should
let us make the tea?

333
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:57,070
Don't worry about me!

334
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,640
Um, Ma'am, why are
you dressed like a hobo?

335
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,508
Maybe she's sick.
Call a doctor!

336
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,043
Simply delicious.

337
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,078
You're quite the cook,
aren't you, sweet cheeks?

338
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,681
Sora, you should
totally marry her.

339
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,882
( snickers )

340
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,951
Stephanie:
<i>Huh, your wife?!</i>

341
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,152
Oh, my, I'm embarrassed!

342
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,188
Miss Dola no!
Please stop!
( screams )

343
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,058
<i>Okay, keep your wits</i>
<i>about you, Stephanie Dola.</i>

344
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,928
<i>You can't let him undo</i>
<i>you with his unworldly wiles.</i>

345
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,930
I'm sorry
if I kept you waiting.

346
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,732
What the?

347
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,634
Sora?

348
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,202
Uh...

349
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,052
Sora:
<i>You'd never guess</i>
<i>there's a tournament</i>

350
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,022
<i>to find the next king</i>
<i>by the looks of this place.</i>

351
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,024
It's like a ghost town.

352
00:14:51,525 --> 00:14:52,192
Hm?

353
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,027
So what the hell
language is that?

354
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,030
Shiro:
Not sure.
Stephanie:

355
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,165
There used to be a time
when Elkia was the largest

356
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,434
of all the Imanity nations.

357
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:02,936
And what's Imanity?

358
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,671
That's the human race.

359
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,972
Oh, so, us?

360
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:08,108
Imanity once had many nations,

361
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,243
and they were spread
all throughout the world,

362
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,212
<i>Stephanie:</i>
<i>But many of them</i>
<i>are already dying out</i>

363
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:14,715
<i>by the time my</i>
<i>grandfather took power.</i>

364
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,349
<i>Now there is only Elkia.</i>

365
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,418
<i>It's gotten to the point</i>
<i>where we have to gamble</i>

366
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,153
<i>our territories</i>
<i>in hopes of gaining</i>

367
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,822
<i>even just a little ground.</i>

368
00:15:21,822 --> 00:15:24,157
Then who else
is there to play against,

369
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:27,260
something other than humans
or Imanity or whatever?

370
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,729
Stephanie:
<i>Yes, exactly.</i>

371
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:31,464
So other aliens
like us, or what?

372
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,766
Well, let's see.

373
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,135
There are a total
of 16 sentient races

374
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,171
that must abide by God's
ten sacred pledges.

375
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,240
Collectively,
we just refer to all the races

376
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,009
as The Exceed
to keep it simple.

377
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,845
The first order
is the Old Deus

378
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,112
who were defeated
by the One God.

379
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,048
The Phantasma
are the second order

380
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:49,516
and The Elementals
are the third.

381
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,885
<i>Skipping to the seventh order,</i>
<i>we have the Elves,</i>

382
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:52,953
<i>who are great at magic</i>

383
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,589
<i>and comprise the world's</i>
<i>largest nation.</i>

384
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,289
<i>On the lower end,</i>

385
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,525
<i>we have the Warbeasts</i>
<i>at number 14,</i>

386
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,493
and The Sirens at the 15th‐
Sora:
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

387
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,096
What's up with the all
this order business?

388
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,931
It's like a ranking system.

389
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,266
From what I've been told,

390
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,735
it's determined by
a race's affinity for magic.

391
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,236
And what about Imanity?

392
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,174
Well, we're at 16.

393
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,076
Sora:
<i>Dead last, huh?</i>

394
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,678
Stephanie:
That's just the way
it is.

395
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,445
We have zero magical abilities.

396
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,248
Zero? So Imanity
can't use magic?

397
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,985
Right, unlike
the other races,

398
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,553
<i>Imanity lacks</i>
<i>the Spirit Circuits</i>

399
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,790
<i>that would allow us to connect</i>
<i>to the source of all magic.</i>

400
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,859
And what's worse than that,
we can't even tell

401
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,529
if someone else
is using magic or not.

402
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,431
Sora:
<i>So you think</i>
<i>you can't win.</i>

403
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,667
Well, you know what
they call that, don't you?

404
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,869
A self‐fulfilling prophecy.

405
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:43,203
Huh?

406
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:46,439
Hey, Steph,
any libraries around here?

407
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:49,910
Steph:
<i>Uh, well, there's a bunch</i>
<i>of books in the study.</i>

408
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,377
<i>However...</i>

409
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,246
They're all in Imanity.

410
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,281
We'll just have
to learn it then, won't we?

411
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,883
Stephanie:
Yeah, I guess so.

412
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,284
Shiro:
Sora?
Huh?

413
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,086
(book slams shut)

414
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:01,421
I learned it.
Stephanie:
Huh?

415
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,356
Sora:
That was fast.
Praise me more.

416
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,826
Yeah, way to go,
Little Sis.
She learned it?

417
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:07,728
You make me so proud of you,
you tiny little genius.
She's gotta be joking, right?

418
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:09,996
She really learned
the entire language that fast?

419
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,098
Yeah, so what?
But that's impossible.

420
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,634
It's only been like
five minutes.

421
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:16,703
Since your spoken language
is the same as ours, it's easy.

422
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:17,704
Catch up, Sora.

423
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,873
Sora:
<i>Huh, a man should</i>
<i>take his time,</i>
<i>This... is totally insane.</i>

424
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,008
<i>instead of</i>
<i>finishing quickly.</i>
<i>This... is totally insane.</i>

425
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,677
My, how very small of you,
Brother.

426
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:24,978
No weiner jokes!
Steph:
<i>Wait, his</i>
<i>rock‐paper‐scissors scheming,</i>

427
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,180
Steph:
<i>Wait, his</i>
<i>rock‐paper‐scissors scheming,</i>

428
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,651
<i>her genius level intelligence,</i>
<i>solid teamwork,</i>

429
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,819
<i>complete trust</i>
<i>and confidence...</i>

430
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,820
You think
you're so special...

431
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,222
<i>Stephanie:</i>
<i>then it's possible</i>
<i>that these two...</i>

432
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:40,260
<i>...that these two could</i>
<i>be the ones to save Elkia!</i>

433
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,630
<i>( cheers and applause )</i>

434
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,300
Man:
And the victor of this match
is Kurami Zell!

435
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,708
( cries )

436
00:17:57,544 --> 00:18:00,947
Sora:
Steph, what made you
want to rule Elkia?

437
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:01,882
Huh?

438
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:04,184
Sora:
I stayed up all night
reading all these books.

439
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,552
I've learned a lot
about this kingdom

440
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,589
and your grandfather
and his whole story.

441
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,790
Oh.

442
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,893
Sora:
Were you scared of losing
your status in the royal family?

443
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:14,360
Steph:
<i>No, not really.</i>

444
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,130
Then it was Elkia
you wanted to save.

445
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,199
That's pretty much it.

446
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,201
Of course I have
other reasons.

447
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:23,369
In any case,
my grandfather was forced

448
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,171
to gamble our
country's territory,

449
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:26,239
but he kept losing.

450
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,042
<i>Hence his title,</i>
<i>"The Foolish King."</i>

451
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,544
<i>But despite people</i>
<i>resenting him,</i>

452
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:33,213
<i>my grandfather believed</i>
<i>in the potential of Imanity.</i>

453
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,981
He didn't care
we were the lowest ranked

454
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,282
or that we can't use magic,

455
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,685
He believed that
if we tried hard enough,

456
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,186
we could win somehow.

457
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:42,355
I want to show the world
that my grandfather

458
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,958
wasn't just some old fool.

459
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,992
If I can become king,

460
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,994
then I can take
our territory back.

461
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:51,598
Then I can prove to everyone
that my grandfather was right,

462
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,568
that we can win.

463
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:57,838
Tell me, Steph,
do you love this country,

464
00:18:57,838 --> 00:18:59,606
this world?

465
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,043
Yeah...

466
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,878
with all of my heart.

467
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,081
Wow, nice.

468
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,850
I'm kind of jealous
you can say that

469
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,553
with such conviction,

470
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:17,257
but... there's no way
that wish is coming true.

471
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,565
<i>Sora:</i>
<i>In fact, as it stands,</i>

472
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:27,668
<i>this country</i>
<i>is already doomed.</i>

473
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,003
<i>Once the next king</i>
<i>takes the throne,</i>

474
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,672
<i>it's all over.</i>

475
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,548
Uh, Kurami?

476
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:44,885
<i>Stephanie:</i>
<i>So it's time for</i>
<i>the coronation already, huh?</i>

477
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,555
Kurami:
Well, well, Princess,

478
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,490
don't tell me you've been
dressing in bed sheets

479
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,358
ever since I beat you.

480
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,060
I believe I heard you say
this was the dress

481
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,731
that your beloved grandfather
gave you before he died.

482
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,666
Here, I don't need it.

483
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,404
Oops.

484
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:13,046
Just face it,
you lost, so move on.

485
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,382
It would be wise if you didn't
make the same mistakes

486
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,852
as the fool
who gave you that dress.

487
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,355
( sobs )

488
00:20:25,926 --> 00:20:27,594
Sora:
You know,
if you keep acting like that

489
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,462
you're only gonna prove
her right.

490
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:35,536
In case you hadn't noticed,
the game's already started.

491
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,343
Sora?

492
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,746
I'm sure you know
pledge six‐

493
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:50,383
all bets made in accordance
with the pledges must be upheld.

494
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,018
So this dress is yours.

495
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:56,456
But just for a while, okay?

496
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,759
Looks like the granddaughter
of The Foolish King

497
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,695
has inherited some
fools for servants, too.

498
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,474
Hey, Shiro?
Mm?

499
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:17,744
You're gonna stick by your bro
no matter what happens?

500
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:18,211
Mm.

501
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:22,248
<i>Shiro:</i>
<i>Just like I promised,</i>
<i>I'll follow you anywhere.</i>

502
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,550
That's a good answer!

503
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,218
This is a pretty
miserable situation, so‐

504
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,488
Liar, you know
you're loving this.

505
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,823
Well, it sure beats
sitting at home

506
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:32,759
and now you can't say I don't
take you anywhere fun, right?

507
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,129
<i>Hey, Steph, you just</i>
<i>gonna sit there forever?</i>

508
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,999
Come on, you want
to win that dress
back from her, don't you?

509
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,167
Let's get going.
Hurry.

510
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,203
Uh...
Sora:
<i>You ready?</i>

511
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,438
But where?

512
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,673
We're going to prove

513
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,409
that your grandfather wasn't
the fool people thought.

514
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:51,978
Huh? Sora!

515
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,516
What's going on?

516
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:58,852
<i>I'm not just having</i>
<i>another fantasy, am I?</i>

517
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,221
Oh, I almost forgot.
Thanks, Steph.

518
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:03,156
Those cookies were great,
nice work.

519
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,891
Yum!

520
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,226
( gasps )

521
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,261
I'm so glad
you liked them!

522
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,531
( laughs )

523
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,435
Sora:
<i>What's next?</i>

524
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,004
<i>I don't know.</i>

525
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,273
<i>Being king might be fun.</i>

526
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:24,611
<i>( theme song plays )</i>

527
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,165
Sora:
<i>You still like your sheet</i>
<i>dress, Steph?</i>

528
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,134
Steph:
<i>I never liked it!</i>
