1
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:04,898
This is impossible.

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,584
Sorry, Imanity's finished.

3
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,603
Are you friggin' serious, after all that smack talk?!

4
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,390
I'm sorry, I didn't expect it to be set in Tokyo!

5
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:16,195
I can't do anything here! It's
our home and we're the away team!

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,714
We can't help you, I'm so sorry.
Please handle this on your own.

7
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:19,770
We can't do it. Try to understand, so sorry.

8
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:21,427
Oh my, could it really be?

9
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,681
Don't tell me that this is the
world you come from, my Masters.

10
00:00:24,706 --> 00:00:27,119
Have fun with the Warbeasts!
I'm sure they'll be just lovely!

11
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:30,436
You're an unreasonably popular man,

12
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:35,849
so popular in fact that girls from all
over the planet chase after you and you alone.

13
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:40,499
However, despite their advances, you
willingly scorn them by the thousands

14
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:44,317
because your heart has already
been captured by your true love.

15
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:55,027
But watch out, anyone faced with such
an overwhelming number of temptations

16
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:58,009
is liable to cave if they're not careful.

17
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,859
Do you have what it takes to
survive the snares of seduction

18
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:05,018
and live to convey your feelings to the one you love?

19
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:09,624
"Living or Dead City Side Story!

20
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,761
Love or Love Part 2!

21
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:17,837
Strike Her Down With Your Bullet of Love!"

22
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,038
"Living or Dead,

23
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:48,609
City Side Story!

24
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,713
Love or Lust 2!

25
00:01:50,763 --> 00:01:53,128
Shoot Her With Your Bullet of Love!"

26
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,037
Yes!

27
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,646
Check, check, hello?

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,220
Hello, can you hear me?

29
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:14,813
Welcome to the world that exists within our game.

30
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:19,706
The match will be held within the bounds of
the virtual reality field that you see before you.

31
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:20,920
Wait.

32
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:21,906
Yes?

33
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:23,760
Let me just confirm something.

34
00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:26,746
All this here is made up? It doesn't really exist, right?

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,574
Like it's just a virtual world you made for
your game and that's it, all just make‐believe.

36
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,426
Yes, that's what I just said, what of it?

37
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,398
Don't scare me like that!

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,718
Screw you, man! That got my PTSD or whatever...

39
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,585
Why are you so upset?

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,811
Do you have some kind of issue
with the contents of this level?

41
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:48,171
You bet your hairy ass I do! Why the
hell would you use Tokyo in a game?!

42
00:02:48,196 --> 00:02:50,420
Is this psychological warfare?! Are you screwing with me?!

43
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:52,287
This is a science‐fiction level,

44
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:55,147
very popular with the youth of the Eastern Federation.

45
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:57,214
That is the only reason it was chosen.

46
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,764
So please try to calm yourself. It's only a game,

47
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,807
So for the most part, there is nothing for you to fear.

48
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:08,217
I guess that explains why the sun
doesn't seem to be bothering me too much.

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,556
Shiro, it's gonna be okay! This isn't Tokyo!

50
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:16,281
It only looks like it is. They
just imagined the whole thing up.

51
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,499
That's right, we're inside a game, you see?

52
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:23,424
Just like "Persona" or "Stein's Gate" or "Akiba Strip!"

53
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:25,386
See? Not scary at all!

54
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:29,143
So... it's just... a game?

55
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:31,662
Oh...

56
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,745
Mm... understood.

57
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:40,659
Good, I think we're okay now. You can start up the game.

58
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,714
Very well then.

59
00:03:43,817 --> 00:03:47,131
Allow me to take this moment to explain the rules to you.

60
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:50,619
Please take a look at the box
located on the ground in front of you.

61
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:59,600
As the NPCs rush to shower you with affection,
take your weapon and shoot them between the eyes.

62
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,584
We gotta shoot them?

63
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,833
By shooting them at times and exploding them at times,

64
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:05,764
you'll make them fall in love with you.

65
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,654
Then what?

66
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:10,711
They will be incapacitated and give you their love power.

67
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,041
The lovey‐dovey gun fires the ammo of amore,

68
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,593
the very essence of love power
that dwells within your heart.

69
00:04:17,618 --> 00:04:20,056
They're seriously calling this the lovey‐dovey gun?

70
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,152
So lame.

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,626
However, if Izuna happens to shoot one of you with
her lovey‐dovey gun, you'll turn into her love slave.

72
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,485
Love slave, really?

73
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,853
As more girls than you can handle
turn to greet you with open arms,

74
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:35,740
the one person you truly love will not!

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,745
The object of this game is to use your love power to
convey the strength of your undying affection for her.

76
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:44,200
Thus ends the explanation!

77
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,626
So what you're saying is I pretty
much have to reject every girl I see?

78
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:51,064
What a rip‐off.

79
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,148
On the other hand, Izuna wants us
all to be part of her little harem

80
00:04:55,346 --> 00:04:57,713
with eyes for her only, am I right?

81
00:04:57,856 --> 00:04:59,741
That is precisely correct.

82
00:04:59,805 --> 00:05:04,355
One final note, I'm afraid magic of any
kind cannot be used in the Virtual World,

83
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,812
so please be aware of that as you strategize.

84
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:11,038
Well, then, do you need a more
detailed explanation of the rules?

85
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,207
No, thanks, I think I can figure it out from here.

86
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,135
All right, let's give this a shot.

87
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,621
Firing the lovey‐dovey gun depletes your love power.

88
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:25,204
And when you defeat the NPCs, it restores your love power.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,152
What you doing? Cut it out!

90
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,330
If an NPC touches you, your love power depletes,

91
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:34,175
and if it runs out, the NPCs will stop approaching you.

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,780
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?

93
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:42,230
But this means you'll run out of energy to fire your
lovey‐dovey gun and become unable to continue combat.

94
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:45,788
So what happens if you shoot an ally, old man?

95
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,515
That will restore all love power to an ally who's run out.

96
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,812
You can also shoot an ally to bring them back to
their senses after they've been turned into a love slave.

97
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:57,841
But the one shot will be temporarily
the love slave of the shooter.

98
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:00,906
Ohh! Agh!

99
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,099
Oh, my Master!

100
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:09,336
Oh, my darling sister, to think that such a
charming, precious girl was so close to me all this time!

101
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,515
When I think how blind I was to not notice your beauty,

102
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,051
oh, I could gouge out my eyes.

103
00:06:15,114 --> 00:06:18,166
No, we can't, Sora! We're brother and sis‐

104
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:19,921
Ohh!

105
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:24,061
Oh, no, Shiro, why are you rejecting
your brother's unconditional love?!

106
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:28,708
So this is the mysterious love triangle, and
unrequited love I read about in my Master's books.

107
00:06:28,733 --> 00:06:31,527
I'm not even capable of experiencing such an emotion,

108
00:06:31,552 --> 00:06:33,967
but I'm so happy I could die!

109
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:37,343
Watch it, Jibirl. You're gonna get it later.

110
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:39,919
I see, so that's how it is.

111
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:44,606
When your a love slave, it's like you become a
zombie and lose all sense of what's going on in the game.

112
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:46,648
There you are!

113
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,783
You jerks left me all on my own again!

114
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,748
What kind of a person just walks off‐

115
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:52,917
Sora, my Prince Charming!

116
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,538
So, Steph, do you understand all the rules so far?

117
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:57,737
Yeah, I understand that love doesn't need rules...

118
00:06:57,762 --> 00:07:00,414
Mm. Of course you don't, that wouldn't make any sense.

119
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,521
Now put this here and this here.

120
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:04,755
Okay, now pull your index finger in.

121
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,192
That way you'll love me forever?

122
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:10,976
Oh, what is this? I'm so beau‐ti‐ful!

123
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:14,334
I thought so, these love bullets can ricochet off things.

124
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,553
This bouncing ability is gonna be key, Shiro.

125
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:17,927
Leave it to me.

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,856
And even though we're inside a game world,
our stamina hasn't changed much from real life.

127
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,794
Keep your running to a minimum if you can.

128
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,638
All right, you two ready to do this?

129
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,164
Yeah!

130
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,441
Looks like they finally decided
to start playing the game for real.

131
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,642
So can you see it, Fiel?

132
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:45,105
Yes, coming in loud and clear.

133
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,641
The view through your eyes is
as perfect as always, Kurami.

134
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,152
That's good to know.

135
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,004
Boy, I bet the Warbeasts must
really hate this kind of magic.

136
00:07:54,522 --> 00:07:57,858
Yes, most definitely, it's very powerful stuff.

137
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:00,169
But it's difficult to maintain.

138
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,515
Either way, I will do my best just for you, Kurami.

139
00:08:04,142 --> 00:08:10,109
The Warbeasts, their physical abilities
are so extreme, they practically defy physics.

140
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:14,088
I'll be interested to see how
someone fights against a race like that.

141
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:20,493
Put on a good show for me... Sora.

142
00:08:25,696 --> 00:08:26,976
Hey there, Izuna.

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,573
When's the last time you really had fun playing a game?

144
00:08:50,332 --> 00:08:52,303
All right, yah!

145
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,003
I knew it!

146
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,886
That's what makes this game truly special.

147
00:08:57,926 --> 00:08:59,644
I know I can do this.

148
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:07,303
Target NPC's cotton panties, max thickness one
millimeter, direction 12:00, firing angle 93 degrees,

149
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:11,410
300 meters per second. Acceptable
targeting error within .5 millimeters.

150
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,834
But I think I can still make it. Fire!

151
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:17,171
Ha ha!

152
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,512
What?

153
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,408
Damn it, it didn't work!

154
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,820
Why?!

155
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:34,555
I give up.

156
00:09:34,665 --> 00:09:36,826
Our race is a bunch of morons.

157
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:42,832
I don't understand why you're
fooling around so much, please.

158
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:46,637
If you lose, you'll bring suffering
to so many people, thank you.

159
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,188
Don't you realize this is a battle?

160
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,866
Yes, bra destroyed!

161
00:09:53,582 --> 00:09:55,790
Of course I've never thought of it as fun.

162
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,936
How could I? Thanks.

163
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:07,446
Footsteps.

164
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,762
Is that Shiro?

165
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:18,726
She's coming this way.

166
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:24,647
All right, you're mine.

167
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:35,920
Hmm?

168
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,031
Oh, shit! Please!

169
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:42,929
That's impossible.

170
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,339
Huh?!

171
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,398
This can't be happening!

172
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:58,270
I'm sure you're surprised right now, Izuna.

173
00:10:58,295 --> 00:11:01,494
In our world, we have these
things called first‐person shooters

174
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,555
where the best marksmen in the
world gather, and guess what?

175
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,882
I'm not the one who holds all the records.

176
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:09,893
Shiro is.

177
00:11:12,116 --> 00:11:13,532
Futile.

178
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,294
Her terrifying knack at calculations allows
her to perfectly predict her enemies' movements.

179
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:27,062
Her firing intervals take into account not only
your movement patterns but your firing speed as well.

180
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,627
Her skills border on precognition.

181
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,250
It seems as though your bullets
harmlessly pass through her,

182
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:37,341
and yet her bullets relentlessly
hunt you down like guided missiles.

183
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,323
Holy crap, please!

184
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,345
I have to get out of here.

185
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,842
Hi, there!

186
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,615
Welcome to your nightmare.

187
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:07,199
It's the Flugel. Jibril!

188
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,164
I'll blind her, thank you.

189
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,931
Oh! Oh!

190
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,730
I forgot, no magic!

191
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,255
Jibril!

192
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,492
I can't dodge it!

193
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:02,688
Oh, Master, my cute little Master,

194
00:13:02,713 --> 00:13:05,644
won't you please come back to me, pretty please?

195
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:08,519
Okay, I get it. I understand now.

196
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,110
She can use her clothes as a shield.

197
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,635
Fiel, did you catch that?

198
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:24,655
I sure did. It's all so very exciting.

199
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,102
Shiro's firing skills are quite amazing,

200
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,326
but Izuna is really something else.

201
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,003
Yes, Sora was completely silent,

202
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,347
and that shot was long‐distance.

203
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,716
I can't believe she was able to not only sense his attack

204
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:39,225
but dodge it as well.

205
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:40,878
It's frightening.

206
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,135
Such is the unique Warbeast ability.

207
00:13:44,262 --> 00:13:45,859
This battle may be futile.

208
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,081
Don't be stupid,

209
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,283
this has nothing to do with their animal senses.

210
00:13:49,283 --> 00:13:50,610
It's not normal.

211
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,050
You mean...

212
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,564
That's right, no doubt about it.

213
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:55,655
A cheat code.

214
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,005
They're up to something.

215
00:13:57,411 --> 00:13:59,045
Be careful out there, guys.

216
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,138
I got it. A cheat that can't be proven.

217
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,229
The whole Warbeast sixth‐sense thing is just a ruse.

218
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,683
I should've known.

219
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,750
They're familiar with this game after all,

220
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:14,628
possibly more so than we are. But no matter.

221
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:18,854
Izuna, they're hiding in the corridor below you.

222
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,484
Shiro is exhausted and can't run.

223
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,819
Use this chance to take them out now!

224
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:26,377
You don't need to tell me twice, please.

225
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:49,238
Jeez, looks like were gonna have to
be on the defensive for a while now.

226
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:53,011
I'm counting on you. Since my
plans to finish this early are dashed,

227
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,544
we're gonna have to wing it.

228
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,229
Wing it? Who am I kidding?

229
00:14:57,348 --> 00:15:01,916
We're trying to play a fair match against
superpower cheaters who know this game inside and out.

230
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,505
We're freakin' screwed.

231
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:07,429
Aha, your luck just ran out, Sora!

232
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:10,371
I'm gonna get you back for all you've
done to me and Mistress Izuna, too!

233
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:16,346
Agh! Oh, Jibril, how could you
do this? I'm never letting you

234
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,542
Bringing her might have been a mistake after all.

235
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,378
out of my sight again!

236
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,019
I'm smiling.

237
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:37,991
And my heart's pounding. It almost hurts my ears.

238
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:42,202
When's the last time you really had fun playing a game?

239
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,813
Shut up, please!

240
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:51,706
Mistress Shiro, what's our next course of action?

241
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,517
Jibril, shut up for a second.

242
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,545
Master, perhaps this is impossible,

243
00:15:57,632 --> 00:15:59,102
even for Mistress Shiro.

244
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:00,659
No, she can do it.

245
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,893
If there's something I can't
handle in a game, Shiro's got my back.

246
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,999
That's always been true, and it always will be.

247
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:09,231
Sora?

248
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,403
Do you... believe in me?

249
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,167
Yeah.

250
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,106
Has your big brother ever doubted you before?

251
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:21,792
Then, Sora...

252
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,611
this time...

253
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,687
it's up to you, okay?

254
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,594
Up to me?

255
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:33,495
Oh, shi...

256
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,620
Shiro!

257
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:50,474
Shiro.

258
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:04,680
The game's as good as over, isn't it?

259
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,524
Why did Shiro protect you back there, Master?

260
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,446
I don't understand her logic.

261
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:13,681
Yeah, well, I do, so don't worry about it.

262
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,405
It's not that Shiro couldn't find the answer.

263
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:19,258
What she did back there was the answer.

264
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,758
It was blank.

265
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,715
In other words, me and her, everything,
including Shiro joining the enemy,

266
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,520
is part of Blank's plan.

267
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:35,098
The only thing left now is for me to complete her magic
formula and lead us all the way to the victory we deserve.

268
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:38,024
That's right, isn't it, Shiro?

269
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:39,613
Jibril.

270
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,113
Huh?

271
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:42,452
Fight Izuna to buy me some time.

272
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:46,215
Of course, whatever you say, Master.

273
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:49,948
However, if I end up destroying her in the process,

274
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:52,515
that won't be a problem, right?

275
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,821
You know, I should probably warn you,

276
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:57,028
but those are famous last words right there.

277
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:59,118
What?! Fine then.

278
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,596
I'll just go defeat her normally.

279
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,637
Well, that makes things easier.

280
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:15,330
Where did she go? She's gone!

281
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,009
Here, little puppy, come to mama.

282
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:25,336
I'm experiencing a good deal of déjà vu.

283
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:28,489
The last time I challenged
the Eastern Federation and lost,

284
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,303
were you my opponent, by chance?

285
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:33,297
Well, I suppose it doesn't matter anyway.

286
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:38,994
I'm so curious to see just how many
tricks you know how to do, little doggie.

287
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:41,774
Let's have some fun, shall we?

288
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,862
Feel free to throw everything you've got at me,

289
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:47,185
and go ahead and embarrass yourself
to your fuzzy little heart's content.

290
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,711
No, come on, Sora!

291
00:19:04,766 --> 00:19:06,983
Going to a different area isn't gonna help.

292
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,645
What the hell am I supposed to do, Shiro?!

293
00:19:20,307 --> 00:19:21,873
I need to run to the roof.

294
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,637
No, she's planned for that.

295
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:27,084
Either way, she'll catch up to me soon, huh?

296
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,319
Huh? Wait, something's not right.

297
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:35,100
Why isn't Shiro running to catch up with me?

298
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,611
If she were trying harder, she'd
have plenty of chances to beat me.

299
00:19:40,694 --> 00:19:43,435
Keep your running to a minimum if you can.

300
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,592
Oh, yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

301
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,095
If I get this wrong, I'm gonna have hell to pay.

302
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,313
Right, Shiro?

303
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,930
Okay, sis, your big brother's just about had it.

304
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,474
This is a rough game for a guy who never leaves his room.

305
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:20,275
Come on, buddy, pull it together.

306
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,278
You absolutely cannot mess this up.

307
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:33,678
Shiro, if there's one thing I know you'd never expect,

308
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,134
it's this!

309
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:36,515
Yah!

310
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,245
I mean, that's totally insane, right?

311
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,087
Gotcha!

312
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,961
Sora, I love you!

313
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:54,716
Yeah, I love you too, Sis.

314
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,252
Izuna, do it now!

315
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:01,709
I thought they'd keep me waiting forever, please.

316
00:21:11,654 --> 00:21:15,517
This is why you saved your strength and
didn't run after me, isn't that right, Shiro?

317
00:21:16,064 --> 00:21:18,026
Sora, I love you.

318
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:19,577
Impossible!

319
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:21,038
Sora just shot her.

320
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,468
She couldn't be able to think rationally yet.

321
00:21:24,062 --> 00:21:24,628
Huh?

322
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:27,457
Her panties, they're gone!

323
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:29,809
There's no way!

324
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,407
Was it really only her panties that got hit?

325
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:34,792
She's not under a lovey‐dovey spell?!

326
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,754
You finally figured it out, huh?

327
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:39,852
All this time, Shiro was never on your side.

328
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:41,082
She never got hit.

329
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:46,103
She let the shot hit a button or something
and pretended to be under my control.

330
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,569
They tricked me. Still, that doesn't change anything.

331
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:52,460
Ha!

332
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,008
When's the last time you really had fun playing a game?

333
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,548
This is fun! Thank you!

334
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,197
We're almost there.

335
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,769
Give Blank everything you got!

336
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:53,174
Okay!
