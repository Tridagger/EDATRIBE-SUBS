Linel: I know, and there
seems to be no end to them.

too many for us to deal with!

something most crucial.

Renly: Kirito?

78
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:19,924
He is the one
who killed the pontifex?

79

Ronie: Sir knight, forgive me
if I'm being impertinent,

80
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,666
but since you're here,
could you please help us?

81
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,869
We hate to ask, but you see,

82
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,807

Kirito safe, no matter what.

We can't defend ourselves
against things like Goblins yet.

Even so, we accepted
this responsibility.

00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:11,343
Kosogi: Thought I was just
another Goblin, did ye, boy?

187
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,047
Well, I ain't so impressed
with ye, either, to be honest.

188
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:19,217
You said before
you were an integrity knight.

189
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:23,087
I was told one of you
could take on a thousand.

190
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,891
But that ain't the case
for ye, now, is it? ( Chuckles )

191
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:30,829
That's why ye be hidin'
all the way back here.

192
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,765
Ain't that right?

193
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,168
Administrator: It seems
that you are broken, child.

194
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,103
Renly: Perhaps she was right.

195
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,172
I am a failure.

196
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,073
Maybe I am.

197
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,842

198
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,178
( chuckles ) You are correct.

199
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:48,513
I am not much of a knight.

200
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,383
Even so, let us be clear.

201
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,852
Though I might be defective,

202
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,820
these are not!

( Kosogi growls )

207
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,480
I can do this all day, boy!

208
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,015
Renly: Release...

209
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,017
Recollection!

210
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,194
Beautiful.

211
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:46,205

Fizel: Well, well, well.

218
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,207
Someone's gotten
a bit more knightly.

219
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,943
We were hoping
to get credit for saving you.

220
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,945
Too bad you had to spoil that.

221
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,681
( Linel sighs )
No one's gonna care

222
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,883
that we chopped off
way more heads than you did.

223
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:31,750
( Fizel groans )

224
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,556
Both: Sir knight,
we humbly request your orders.

225
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,291
( Renly gasps )

226
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,426
( Clears throat )

227
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,561
Very well, then.

228
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,829
Keep Kirito and the girls safe.

229
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,031
Fizel: You don't
have to worry about that.

230
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,501
We handed them all off
to the supply corps just now.

231
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,570
( Renly sighs )

232
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,305
We should secure the area, then.

233
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:54,907
Linel: We killed
all the Goblins here.

234
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:55,908
( Renly gasps )

235
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:57,442
I-If  that is the case,

236
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,445
then I suppose
we'd best return to our units.

237
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,313
Fizel: Yes, sir.

238
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,715
Linel: As you command.

239
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,758
Renly: Thank you.

240
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,771
Mage: Lord Sigurosig,
Lord Shibori, and Lord Kosogi

241
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,173
have all been killed.

242
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,242
Dee: Useless wretches.

243
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,911
Demi-Humans can't be
counted on for anything.

244
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,581
Have you located
all the integrity knights yet?

245
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,183
Mage: Currently
we have the three

246
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:40,052
on the front lines
in our sights.

247
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,855
We found two more
among their rear units,

248
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,257
but we do not
have a fix on them yet.

249
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,860
Dee: There are
only five knights here?

250
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,129
Impossible, unless that is
all they ever had.

251
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,998
Regardless of how many
there are here,

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,268
we must slaughter them all.

253
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,336
Go on. Wake the minions.

254
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,338
Have them fly for 700 mels,

255
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,675
then descend
upon the battlefield...

256
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,810
And kill everything.

257
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,279
Mage: Forgive the question,

258
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,948
but won't our Demi-human units
get caught in that?

259
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,349
- Dee: Too bad.
- Mage: Right.

260
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,286
How many minions do you wish?

261
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,354
We have 800 available.

262
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:18,356
They are all
hatched and ready to go.

263
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,992
Dee: Hmm.

264
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:22,928
( Slurps )

265
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,131
Send every last one of them.

his perfect weapon control.

274
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,070
He has made his move.

Dee: You imbecile!

278
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
How did we not know

279
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,656
they had
such a large unit of mages?

280
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,992
- Mage: Th-they don't.
- ( Dee sputtering )

281
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,927
Mage: I-I don't know
what happened.

282
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,798
( Dee breathes deeply )

283
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:08,333
Have they deployed
their flying dragons yet?

284
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,601
Mage: No.

285
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,136
The skies above the battlefield
are clear.

286
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,539
Not one dragon has been spotted.

287
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,276
Dee: Then there can be
only one explanation for it.

288
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:22,014
That must be
perfect weapon control,

289
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,149
their knight's special skill.

290
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,484
Damn them.

291
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,220
( Scoffs ) They are
stronger than I thought.

292
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:32,090
Using a weapon that way
is risky, though.

293
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,693
It would drain massive amounts
of the knight's life.

294
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,029
How could they unleash
such a barrage?

295
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,430
Mage: I just got word, milady.

296
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,233
Our spotters located
the two knights in the rear.

297
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,567
We've targeted them.

298
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,004
We now have all five of them
in our sights.

299
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,406
Dee: Good.

300
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,710
I have waited for this.

00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,914
It is my chance for glory,

Ogre archers and dark mages,

304
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,587
advance into the ravine!

305
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,122
Once you are in position,

306
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:09,127
ready the bows, and begin
the incineration incantation!

Prepare for wide-range
incineration projectiles!

310
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:34,286
Spotters, begin the incantation
to guide the projectiles

311
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,921
to the integrity knight's
position!

312
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,324

318
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:01,045
That the souls
of the fallen below,

319
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,315
whether human or Demi-human,

320
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:06,919
generate sacred power
that is so warm and pure?

321
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,522
The people of the human empire

322
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,324
and the monsters
of the dark territory

323
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:15,527
have essentially the same souls.

324
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,131
The only difference
is whether they were born

325
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:22,434
on one side of the end mountains
or the other.

326
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,271
If so, then why are they--

327
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
why are we fighting?

328
00:18:30,411 --> 00:18:33,979
Kirito, if you were here...

329
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,684
No. I raised my sword
against the pontifex

330
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:42,154
and defied the axiom church.

331
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,157
It is my duty
to see this through now.

As far as maintaining elements,

336
00:18:52,433 --> 00:18:56,301
I am no match for what thousands
of dark mages are capable of,

337
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,704
and converting sacred power
into fire or ice elements

338
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,573
would not be
a potent enough art

339
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,310
to sap all the spatial resources
rising from the ravine.

340
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:07,846
However...

Sealing luminous elements
