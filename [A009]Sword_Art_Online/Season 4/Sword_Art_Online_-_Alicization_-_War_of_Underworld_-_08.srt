1
00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:04,403
Alice: Burst element.

2
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,143
( Mages yelling )

3
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:13,211
Mage: Wh-what do we do?!

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,014
( Mages screaming )

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,917
( Dee gasps )

6
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,558
Mage 2: For some reason,

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,560
there was a lack
of spatial power,

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,964
and we couldn't conjure
our incineration projectiles,

9
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,367
and then the enemy
launched a large-scale attack.

10
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,636
90% of the Demi-human unit,

11
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,104
70% of the Ogre Archers,

12
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:43,508
and over 30% of the Dark Mage
unit were destroyed.

13
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,843
Dee: "For some reason"?

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,178
Are you dense?!

15
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,112
Someone used
a massive formal art

16
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,450
and drained all
the spatial power in the ravine!

17
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,652
But how can that be?

18
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,055
I can't even conjure
a spell of that scale.

19
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,958
Who do they have
that is that powerful?

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,064
¶

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,033
( singing in Japanese )

22
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,968
¶

23
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,972
( army yelling, cheering )

24
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:51,944
( Applause )

25
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,215
Fanatio: Welcome back.
You did well.

26
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,217
( Gasps )

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,520
The enemy has retreated.

28
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:04,056
You guided us to victory.

29
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,323
Alice: No, Fanatio.

30
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,260
This battle
is far from being over.

31
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,397
More sacred power
has collected in the ravine.

32
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,199
We must consume it
with healing arts

33
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:16,935
before the enemy can absorb it.

34
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,738
Time is short,
and we have yet to face

35
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,540
their dark knights
and pugilists.

36
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,075
Fanatio: True.

37
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,211
All who are able,
take the wounded, and fall back!

38
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,946
Priests, focus on healing

39
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,215
until all the spatial power
has been depleted!

40
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,552
And keep watch
for enemy movement!

41
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:36,555
I will go and
give my report to the commander.

42
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,156
Will you be all right here?

43
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,124
Alice: Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,431
I could not have succeeded
without you, Amayori.

45
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,567
Eat your fill,
and get some rest.

46
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,568
You've earned it.

47
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,836
( Amayori trills )

48
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,672
( Wings flapping )

49
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,110
Eldrie: Milady.

50
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,111
Alice: Eh?

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,183
( Gasps ) Eldrie!

52
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,518
Have you been injured?

53
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:10,054
Eldrie: No.
Nothing major, at least.

54
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,656
But if I am being honest,

55
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,592
I would have preferred
to perish.

56
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,260
Alice: What kind
of talk is that?

57
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,529
Your troops look up to you,
and you have a duty

58
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,265
to lead them
and fight to the very end.

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,335
Eldrie: And yet,
as a leader, I have failed.

60
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,437
( Shuddering )

61
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,074
Not only did
the goblins breach my ranks,

62
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:33,077
their commander
was felled by Sir Renly.

63
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,546
How humiliating.

64
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:39,418
I betrayed your teachings
and your expectations of me.

65
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,487
To think I could be worthy

66
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,756
of her heart, her love,

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,425
how laughable!

68
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,496
I do not have the right
to call myself your disciple!

69
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,167
Alice: Of course you do.
I know you did all you could.

70
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,103
Can you not see
how much everyone needs you--

71
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,173
the troops under your command,
the citizens,

72
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:03,175
I, too, as a matter of fact.

73
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,577
Eldrie: Do you?

74
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,046
For my strength
on the battlefield?

75
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,381
Nothing more?

76
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,283
- ( Male groaning )
- ( Both gasp )

77
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,386
¶

78
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,654
( groaning continues )

79
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:16,522
( Alice gasps )

80
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,001
Alice: Stop right there!

81
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,470
What business
do you have here unarmed?

82
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:33,605
Your life is almost at its end.

83
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
Furgr: I be Furgr.

84
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,409
I be Chief of all Ogre.

85
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,211
Alice: Keep up your guard.

86
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,213
He is one
of their council of ten.

87
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,747
Furgr: I saw all.

88
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:48,220
The light and fire,
you conjure, unleash.

89
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,489
Your power, your look,

90
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,624
you be Priestess of Light.

91
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,161
If take back with me,
end of war,

92
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:59,297
ogre return to plains.

93
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,099
Alice: Priestess? End of war?

94
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,901
Who told you this?

95
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,636
Come on now. Speak up.

96
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,473
Eldrie: Milady, this fiend
is obviously stalling!

97
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,242
( Furgr growls )

98
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,576
( Eldrie yells )

99
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,378
( Gasps )

100
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:14,513
But, milady,

101
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,382
he lies!

102
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,583
Alice: As you say,

103
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,052
I am the Priestess of Light.

104
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,522
Now, then,
before I go anywhere with you,

105
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,458
I wish to know
who it is that seeks me.

106
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,527
Furgr: Emperor Vecta.

107
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,794
( Alice gasps )

108
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,997
Furgr: He say
find Priestess of Light.

109
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,268
He grant wish
to who catch and bring to him,

110
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:40,338
and then ogre can go home,

111
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,276
raise horses,
hunt bird, and live.

112
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,945
Alice: Surely you
must despise me.

113
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,948
Do you not wish to avenge
your people? I killed them.

114
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,618
Furgr: Burden of strong
heavy as they be strong.

115
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,155
I Chief.
My burden to protect kind.

116
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,691
Is why I have no choice.

117
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,360
I catch you and take back!

118
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,930
( Roaring )

119
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,317
¶

120
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,323
Alice: May your soul
return home,

121
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,425
back to the plains.

122
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,469
Emperor Vecta.

123
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,207
Gabriel: Hmph. So the reason
your strategy failed

124
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,209
and a thousand dark mages died

125
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:54,146
was because the enemy
absorbed all the spatial power

126
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,347
before you could.

127
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,482
Did I understand that correctly?

128
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,151
Dee: Yes.

129
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:03,087
Y-Your majesty,
I-I swear we had no idea

130
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,423
they had someone
who could cast such an art,

131
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,360
only the pontifex,
and she is dead.

132
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,963
Gabriel: Is there some other way
to replenish this power?

133
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,698
Dee: Yes,
using spatial resources,

134
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,167
such as rich land and sunlight,

135
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,170
but to generate enough power
to destroy the enemy,

136
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:19,504
we would need ample amounts,

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,707
and unfortunately
there is little here.

138
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,509
Gabriel: Obviously.

139
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,313
In fact,
I see no grass or trees at all,

140
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,448
and the sun set a while ago.

141
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,985
So tell me,
what were you going to use

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,453
as a power source
for your attack spell?

143
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,256
Dee: Well, each life has power,

144
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,324
and during the assault,

145
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,393
as warriors
from both sides died,

146
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,129
their expired lives filled
the air with spatial power.

147
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,130
Gabriel: Ah.

148
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,434
( Dee sobbing )

149
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,336
¶

150
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,238
Gabriel: Blood and life.

151
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,542
( Dee gasps )

152
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,410
( Whimpers )

153
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,479
Gabriel: Dee Eye Ell,

154
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,414
would 3,000 be sufficient?

155
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,948
Dee: Uh, what?

156
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:04,883
( Gasps )

157
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,556
( Gasps )

158
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,226
( Sighs )

159
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,628
Yes, your majesty.

160
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,464
That would be enough.

161
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,241
( Soft chatter )

162
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,578
Bercouli: "Priestess of Light"?

163
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:37,449
Alice: Yes. I do not recall
reading about this person

164
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,251
in any of the history books,

165
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,053
but whoever she may be,

166
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,589
the emperor of
the dark territory is after her.

167
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,190
( Bercouli grunts )

168
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,658
This emperor...

169
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,395
Is the Dark God Vecta, huh?

170
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,730
Fanatio: A god walking among us?
I find that hard to believe.

171
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:55,734
Bercouli: All right, kid.
Let's say Vecta's back

172
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,069
and running things
in the dark territory.

173
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,671
If what the ogre said's true

174
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,673
and Vecta's looking
for this Priestess of Light

175
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,275
and he thinks you're it,

176
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:07,112
how's that gonna affect
where this war goes from here?

177
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,083
Alice: The five tribes
want the resources

178
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,285
of the human empire. However...

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,155
Vecta just wants
the Priestess of Light.

180
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:18,890
I have a plan.

181
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,626
I shall enter
the dark territory,

182
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,228
then make my way
to the edge of it.

183
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,031
If the Priestess of Light
is what Vecta wants,

184
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,501
then he will come after me
with most of his army.

185
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:32,638
The troops he leaves behind
will be without leadership,

186
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,106
and you can wipe them out
in the chaos.

187
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:39,645
Then I shall make my way
to the world's end altar.

188
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,114
Kikuoka: All right,
once we're off the line,

189
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,316
I'll crank the F.L.A. To 1,000.

190
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:47,252
Then take Alice, and head
to the world's end altar!

191
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,121
Kirito: I never
heard of that place!

192
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,589
Kikuoka: That's okay!
Just go out the eastern gate,

193
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,125
and the altar's due south.

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,095
Alice: Perhaps, if I go there...

195
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,664
( Bercouli sighs ) All right,

196
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,600
but I'm sending a third
of our troops along with you.

197
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,202
Alice: Uncle...

198
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,672
You cannot spare that many
just for my escort.

199
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,641
Bercouli: The enemy
has more than 30,000 left.

200
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,145
They're not all gonna chase you,

201
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:15,347
especially if you're
the only one running around.

202
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:18,416
If the plan is to get them
to split their ranks,

203
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,086
we gotta give 'em
a big enough reason to.

204
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,221
Alice: You have a point.

205
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,423
Bercouli: I got
one more condition for you.

206
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,159
Alice: What is it?

207
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:28,960
Bercouli: The only way
you're doing this

208
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,063
- is if I come along.
- Alice: Huh?

209
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,299
( Bercouli chuckles )

210
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,704
Dee: Orc chief Lilpilin,

211
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:41,573
you will offer 3,000 lives

212
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:44,309
so that my dark mages
can launch their attack spell.

213
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:45,844
( Lilpilin gasps )

214
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,645
Y-You can't do that to us!

215
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,448
My tribe are warriors,
and we came here to fight!

216
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:51,983
You and your people failed,

217
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,452
so why do we have to pay
for that with our lives?!

218
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,388
Dee: This is an order
from the emperor.

219
00:10:56,524 --> 00:10:57,789
( Lilpilin growls )

220
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,124
- Orc: Lil!
- ( Lilpilin gasps )

221
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,526
Orc: We have no choice,

222
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,128
'cept to obey
his majesty's orders.

223
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,262
Lilpilin: But, Lenju--

224
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,464
Lenju: If he needs
3,000 of our troops,

225
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,267
I'll offer my life
and my clan's.

226
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:12,538
I'll do it for him
and for the honor of the orc.

227
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,439
( Lilpilin groans )

228
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,541
Lenju: Lil...

229
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,809
You know what I believe.

230
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,545
All souls go to heaven.

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,081
Be it human or orc,
when we die, we go there.

232
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,351
And that's where I'll
be waiting for you.

233
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,085
( Lilpilin sobs )

234
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:28,620
I know, Len. I know.

235
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:31,489
I'm sorry I can't stop this!

236
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,425
( Dee groans )

237
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,694
You will assemble your troops
100 mels from the ravine,

238
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,365
3,000, not one less.

239
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:40,366
Do it now.

240
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,234
( Lilpilin growls )

241
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:44,136
¶

242
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,514
Bercouli: Right. Move out!

243
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,651
( Soldiers yelling )

244
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,029
Alice: Eldrie.

245
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,600
Our goal is to split
the enemy forces

246
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,269
and destroy the group
that follows us.

247
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,471
After we pass
through the eastern gate,

248
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,406
the guard unit,
the priest unit,

249
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,675
and the supply corps
will head south.

250
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,413
If the terrain is favorable,
the troops will take position.

251
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,549
Until then, we knights
will act as a diversion.

252
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,456
( Fanatio breathes deeply )

253
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,026
Return to your positions,

254
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,695
and prepare for battle!

255
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,168
¶

256
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,245
Mages: System call.

257
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,183
Transfer human unit durability,
area to self.

258
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,918
Generate umbral element.

259
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,586
- Form element.
- ( Lilpilin gasping )

260
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,122
Mages: Worm shape.

261
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,291

( Lilpilin shuddering )

263
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,340
Orcs: Long live the Orc Tribe!

264
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:30,275
Glory be to the Orc!

265
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,410
( Gagging )

266
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,179

( Lenju groans )

268

( Lilpilin gasps ) Lenju!

269
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,693
( Lenju sighs )

270
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,696
( Lilpilin crying )

271
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,234
Damn humans.

272
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,369
Damn them all.

273
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,571
( Sobbing )

274
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,909
A curse on every one of them.

275
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,644
( Wind blowing )

276
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,451
Mages: Transfer
human unit durability.

277
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,453
- Alice: It can't be.
- Mages: Area to self.

278
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,988
Alice: They are
chanting a sacred art.

279
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,392
Uncle! I used
all the spatial resources here.

280
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:23,261
There should not be enough left
to carry out a large-scale art!

281
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,462
( Bercouli gasps )

282
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,464
There is. They're making it.

283
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,300

284
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,404
( Dee laughs )

285
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,806
What incredible power.

286
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,943
How magnificent.

287
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,413
So much darkness.
So much potential.

288
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,415
( Sighing )

289
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,818

Mage: I just got word
from our spotters.

291
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,622
There are
integrity knights approaching.

292
00:14:50,758 --> 00:14:52,358
Dee: This Deathworm attack spell

293
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,826
can't be blocked
by sword or armor.

294
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:58,564
Those damned integrity knights
will be devoured alive!

295
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,566
Be patient!

296
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,167
Let them get closer!

297
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:05,471
Hold. Hold.

298
00:15:08,376 --> 00:15:10,375

We're gonna lure 'em away.

Pull up!

304
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,458

No, kid!

if you are truly
the king of snakes,

312
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,616
then you should have no trouble

313
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,684

thanks to you.

Eldrie: Do not cry, milady.

343

You must think
of those who need you.

344
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,096
They are all
that matter now, not I.

345
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,566
I have behaved so selfishly.

346
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,302
I thought I could
have you all to myself.

Just stay!
