00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,537
Administrator: Have you ever
felt you were going to die?

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,472
Bercouli: Eh?

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,208
I don't remember
how long ago it was,

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,077
but there was one time.

6
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:14,012
It was during a fight
with the last general

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,348
of the Dark Knights
or the one before.

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:18,683
Didn't think
I'd make it out of that one.

9
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,019
( Administrator laughs )
You did, though.

10
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:23,221
Eventually you brought
his head back to me.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,557
You felt it then? Never again?

12
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,559
Bercouli: Hmm?

13
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:30,295
If I did, I don't remember.

14
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,631
Why are you asking?
I doubt someone like you

15
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,432
worries about dyin'. Am I right?

16
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,433
( Administrator chuckles )

17
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,703
Not true, my dear Bercouli.

18
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,840
I feel death hovering over me
every single day.

19
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,175
( Bercouli gasps )

20
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,310
Administrator:
It is there in my dreams

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,313
and in the morning
when I awaken.

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:53,251
Why? Because I still
do not control everything,

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,920
because I still have
enemies who live

24
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,856
and because, the longer I live,

25
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,659
it is possible that,
at some point in the future,

26
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,195
there will come a new enemy.

27
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,597
( Bercouli chuckles )
Point taken, my lady.

28
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,602
I guess bein' the pontifex
ain't easy after all, huh?

29
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:22,280
Your eminence, I didn't get
what you meant then,

30
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,748
but I do now.

36
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,731
Ronie: Here. Eat up.

37
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,411
I have to say you're looking

38
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,812
much healthier this morning,
kirito.

39
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,347
( Women gasp )

40
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,884
Ronie: And your appetite's
back with a vengeance.

41
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,485
( Women sigh, chuckle )

42
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,819
Alice: Perhaps
spending the night

43
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,122
with four lovely ladies
is the reason.

44
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,159
Asuna: Eh? ( Chuckles )

45
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,629
( Horn blowing )

46
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,167
( Running footsteps )

47
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:52,504
Bercouli: I'll be damned.

48
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,973
It looks like Emperor Vecta's

49
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,576
got some bold strategies
in mind.

50
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,579
He's taking a risk,
and it's gonna cost him big.

51
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:02,781
( Alice gasps )

( gasps )

54
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,791
Bercouli: This is war, folks.

55
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,394
I wanna remind you
this ain't the time for mercy.

56
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:20,064
The enemy's makin' their way
across that canyon Asuna made.

57
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,734
This is our chance to stop 'em.

58
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,335
Alice: Chance?

59
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,603
Bercouli: Yeah.

60

00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,349
Iskahn: Keep going. Hurry!

Gabriel: I want you
to cast some ropes over

68
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,365
to the other side
and send your people across.

69
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,433
If they fall, they fall.

70
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,901
( Iskahn growls )

71
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,305
Gabriel: Execute anyone
who doesn't comply.

72
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,641
Iskahn: What the hell?

73
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,311
The five tribes should be
conquering the human empire,

74
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,514
not chasing
after some priestess of light.

75
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:11,249
We're out here
dyin' for nothin'!

76
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,518
Come on, come on. Move it.

77
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,453
Get across while you can.

78
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,556
Hurry, before the enemy notices!

79

The integrity knights
are coming!

86

Protect the ropes
'til the rest of us get across!

Iskahn: This--this ain't no war!

93
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:17,916
They can't even
defend themselves!

94
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,519
My people trained for this?

95
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:24,656
To shimmy across a rope
and die for no reason at all?!

96
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,658
¶

97
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,994
forgive me.

Gabriel: No doubt about it.
The human empire's a.I.S

100
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,876
are slightly superior
to the dark territory's.

101
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:44,877
Well done.

102
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:47,145
As far as adaptability goes,

103
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,347
they're on a whole other level.

104
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,983
You're up, Critter.

105
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,419
Don't blow it.

106
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,625
Critter: And for my next trick,

107
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,228
syncing the Underworld's time
to the real world.

108

110
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,108
No way!

111
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:17,642
Is this for real?

112
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,043
Gamer 2: Are they crazy?

113
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,580
A pvp with
life-like human avatars

114
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:23,248
and realistic violence?

115
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,049
Gamer 3: You mean
we can like cut off arms

116
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,185
and heads and stuff? No way!

117
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:29,721
Gamer 4: No restrictions?!
Hell to the yes!

118
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,123
This developer's adventurous!

00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,524
Gamer 5: Yeah, baby!

120
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,659
I'm so signing up
for this beta!

Critter: Don't push.

122
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,797
There's enough dark knight
accounts for everyone.

123
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:42,901
Go forth, my dudes, and chop
that human army to ribbons.

Yui: Daddy! Mommy!

125

Sinon: Yui? Wh-what are you--

132
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,106
Yui: I'm sorry to call so late,
but it's an emergency!

133
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,041
Get dressed. There's a taxi
waiting out front.

134
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,910
I sent the address and
the fastest route to your phone.

135

Make sure to follow it!

136
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,648
Sinon: Wh-what's going on?
Where am I going?

137
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,183
Yui: Daddy and mommy
are in danger!

138
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:32,818
I'll explain on the way!

Leafa: Driver, take me
to minato ward in Tokyo, please.

140
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,995
Sorry I left
without telling you, mom,

141
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,798
but Kazuto's in trouble,
and he needs me.

( Sighs )

146
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:04,616
It's been ten hours

147
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,685
since Asuna logged in
to the Underworld,

148
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,087
so in there, it's been a year.

149
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,223
What's taking her so long?

( Yawns )

151
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:18,030
The world's end altar
can't be that far away from her.

152
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,698
Or can it?

153
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:20,699
- ( Telephone rings )
- ( Gasps )

154
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,100
Hey! Keeks!

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,836
- The phone!

Kikuoka: Kikuoka in subcon.
Talk to me.

Man: Hello, sir. I know
I'm not supposed to call hq

158
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,176
unless it's important.

159
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,645
This is Hiraki at Rath Roppongi.

160
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,114
We've got an issue here.

161
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,183
I think
it's some kind of prank.

162
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,919
A couple visitors
just showed up at our location

163
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,387
without an appointment.

164
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,257
Kikuoka: Visitors?
Who are they, clients?

165
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,060
Hiraki: No, they're
definitely not clients,

166
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,062
but they seem to know
a lot about us.

167
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,797
They're girls,
two teenage girls.

168
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,866
Higa and Kikuoka: What?!

169
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,600
Kikuoka: Teenagers, you said?

170
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,601
Hiraki: Yeah.

171
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,871
Anyway, they knew your name

172
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,005
and that you were at rath hq,
so I let them in.

173
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,807
They said I should call you

174
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,609
and ask you
to check the f.L.A. Rate

175
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,679
of the Underworld,
said it was urgent.

176

Holy...

It--it's one to one?!

179
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,686
Since when?!

180
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,820
Kikuoka: Hey, Hiraki,

181
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,021
did the girls
tell you their names?

182
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:18,356
Hiraki: Yes, sir,

183
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,893
but the names they gave
are obviously fake.

184
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,762
They said not to worry,
you'd know who they were.

185
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,898
Hold on. I wrote them down.

186
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,901
Let's see.
One called herself "Sinon,"

187
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,769
and the other, "Leafa."

188
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,638
It sounds crazy, but that's
what they told me to tell you.

189
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:34,573
( Both gasp )

190
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,549
Klein: I swear. He's in a coma,

191
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:48,753
and he still managed to get
caught up in something crazy.

192
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,156
I mean,
a full-on A.I. Called Alice

193
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:54,626
who was born in a virtual world
made by the sdf?

194
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,562
( Groans )
This is way beyond v.R. Games,

195
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,364
and there's no goin' back.

196
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,766
Silica: Poor Alice.
She's so special,

197
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,768
and they just want her
to fly fighter jets.

198
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:06,839
Yui: Ultimately, yes,
but they won't right away.

199
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,173
Rath will probably use her

200
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:11,109
to demonstrate the technology
to the world first.

201
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,179
The hijackers aboard
the ocean turtle, however,

202
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,715
aren't interested
in demonstrations.

203
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,050
I think, once they get her,

204
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,318
they'll use her
for what she was intended.

205
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,320
Klein: Know anything else
about those creeps,

206
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,322
like who they are
or where they're from?

207
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,058
Yui: I can't confirm it,

208
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,794
but I think they're
U.S. military or intelligence.

209
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,663
- ( Group gasps )
- Klein: What?!

210
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,930
Lisbeth: They're behind it?!

211
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,998
O-Oh, my god.

212
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:37,069
Yui: Again, I can't confirm
they're involved with this,

213
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:41,740
but if they are and Alice
does fall into their hands,

214
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,341
they'll use her
for drone warfare.

215
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:48,681
I know daddy and mommy wouldn't
want that to happen to her,

216
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,215
because Alice--

217
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,150
Alice is proof!

218
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,753
Her existence proves
all v.R. Worlds,

219
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,755
starting with "s.A.O.,"
are real,

220
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,157
that those who lived in them
had real lives!

221
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,227
She's the result of massive
amounts of the time, energy,

222
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:05,830
and imagination
of thousands of humans!

223
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:09,234
( All gasp )

224
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:12,036
Yui: I'm convinced
beyond a doubt

225
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:15,741
she's why the seed package
was created, its true purpose...

226
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,244
To give birth
to someone like her.

227
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,379
Throughout all
the connected worlds

228
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,115
that sprang up from the seed,

229
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,919
so many people have laughed,
cried, suffered, and loved.

230
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,053
It was the radiance
of all those souls

231
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,256
shimmering with life
that made it possible

232
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:35,394
for a new form of humanity
to be born in the Underworld.

233
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,062
Daddy and mommy,

234
00:11:37,131 --> 00:11:42,000
Leafa, Klein, Lisbeth,
Silica, Agil, and Sinon,

235
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:45,137
it's the combination of
your hearts and so many others,

236
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,472
all woven together
in a big tapestry,

237
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,141
that gave birth to Alice!

238
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,278
Lisbeth: Yeah, you're right.

239
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,414
It's all connected,

240
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:59,017
people and time
and our hearts, too,

241
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,219
flowin' like a big river.

242
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,287
Yui: Eh?

243
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,089
Silica: It's okay, Yui.

244
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,824
Don't cry.

245
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,093
We'll rescue kirito and Asuna.

246
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:12,164
I promise, we'll do whatever it
takes to get them out of this.

247
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,232
You can count on that.

248
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,634
Klein: Damn straight.

249
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,102
You should have
come to us sooner.

250
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,037
If there's a chance
to get 'em out,

251
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,505
hell, we're taking it.

252
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,774
Agil: You got that right.

253
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,508
I owe 'em as much as anyone.

254
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,178
'Bout damn time
I started paying 'em back.

255
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,781
Yui: You guys!
Thank you so much!

256
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,315
( Laughs )

257
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,384
Seriously, thank you.

258
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,319
Klein: Mm-hmm.

259
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,054
Now the hard part.

260
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,191
There's 30,000
American vrmmo players diving,

261
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,794
and soon it could
go up to 100 thou.

262
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,997
The human army's
just a bunch of targets to them.

263
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:47,732
Lisbeth: What's stopping us from
doing what the hijackers did?

264
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:51,336
We can post on the same
U.S. vrmmo sites, too.

265
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:53,538
We'll tell the players
about the experiment

266
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,408
and the fake beta.
I'm pretty sure they'll listen.

267
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,210
Yui: At the center of it all
is a struggle

268
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,013
for military secrets
between Japan and America.

269
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:04,949
If we told anyone about that,
it would just make this worse.

270
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,150
Agil: Mm-hmm.

271
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,152
Silica: If we said
they'd be killing

272
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,221
real people,
not avatars, maybe--

273
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,955
oh, who am I kidding?

274
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,224
( Klein scoffs )

275
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,894
Well, I say we tear a page
out of their playbook.

276
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,563
We'll post a notice
for the beta test ourselves.

277
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,033
Then we get the rath guys
to hand out accounts,

278
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,703
and I bet we could get 30,000
or 40,000 logged on, easy.

279
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,840
Agil: That's a great idea, man,
but there's one problem.

280
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,842
Klein: You gonna
tell me what that is?

281
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,243
- Agil: The time.
- ( Klein gasps )

282
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,513
Agil: Here in Japan,
it's 4:30 in the morning.

283
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:37,516
Besides us, there's not
a whole lot of folks online.

284
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:40,385
But in Los Angeles,
it's half past noon right now

285
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,454
and 3:30 in New York.

286
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:45,323
The U.S. has way more
active players online.

287
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,925
( Klein groans )

288
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,261
Yui: Agil is correct about that.

289
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,464
We couldn't get the number
of players we need right now.

290
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,867
It would be
way less than 10,000.

291
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:58,070
Our accounts would be
the same level as the Americans,

292
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,004
so we'd be evenly matched.

293
00:14:00,074 --> 00:14:01,940
Fighting all of them off
would be impossible.

294
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,210
Lisbeth: But, like, maybe rath
has more god accounts

295
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,411
like the one Asuna's using.

296
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
We can't start from scratch.

297
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,750
We'd need as much time as kirito
to level up enough.

298
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,152
Klein: Crap. Game over, then.

299
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,087
- Yui: No.
- ( Both gasp )

300
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,956
Yui: There are strong accounts,

301
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,093
both in terms of level
and in equipment.

302
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,028
The Americans' default accounts
can't compare.

303
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,765
Lisbeth: Really?
How do we get them?

304
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,501
Yui: That's the best part.
The accounts are already yours.

305
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,303
They're the ones
you're logged in with now.

306
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,971
Lisbeth: Huh?

307
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,639
Yui: You must convert them.

308
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,508
If you do, then you

309
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:40,112
and all the other vrmmo players
you recruit will start

310
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,381
with stronger accounts
than the Americans.

311
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:45,450
You're all leveled up already.
Just convert, and log in!

312
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,186
Klein: Of course! Why didn't
any of us think of that?!

313
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:53,325
Yui: Although I should mention
this plan involves some risk.

314
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,194
( Crowd murmuring )

315
00:14:58,532 --> 00:14:59,932
Lisbeth: What i'm
about to tell you

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
is not some kind of prank.

317
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:04,336
There's a place
called the Underworld.

318
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,071
It's a virtual world
based on the seed,

319
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,141
made by Japanese researchers.

320
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,810
As I stand here,
tens of thousands

321
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,012
of American players
are logging in to it.

322
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,348
They've been told it's a beta
for a hack-and-slash game

323
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,951
and they can kill
anyone they come across.

324
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,553
But the people
of the Underworld are real.

325
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,421
They're not just npcs.

326
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,157
They're true bottom-up a.I.S

327
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:27,426
with feelings
and souls like us.

328
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,227
We need your help
to protect them,

329
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,963
but there's no time
to level up there.

330
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,298
But if you convert
your character accounts

331
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:36,100
to the Underworld,
we can save their people!

332
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,836
( Crowd murmuring )

333
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,307
Sakuya: I know you well,

334
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,242
and I trust your intentions.

335
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,178
You wouldn't have
called us so early

336
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,180
just so you could play
a trick on us.

337
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,650
And the fact kirito hasn't
logged on for over ten days

338
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:55,520
suggests whatever is going on
is indeed serious.

339
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,923
But a.I.S with human souls

340
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,460
and the U.S. military
out to steal them,

341
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:04,596
it all seems so far-fetched.

342
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:07,332
Diving in would be
the only way to confirm it.

343
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,203
In private, you told me
you had other concerns,

344
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:14,939
that converting our accounts
would have risks.

345
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:18,143
You should explain
what those are before we decide.

346
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:19,478
Lisbeth: Sure.

347
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,914
Here's what I know.

348
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:26,084
The Underworld
isn't a vrmmo game.

349
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,020
It's a simulated civilization,

350
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:32,224
so you'll be faced with
a few issues once you dive in.

351
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:35,293
The first one
is there's no user interface

352
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,162
to call up and manipulate.

353
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,432
Once you're logged in,
you can't log yourself out.

354
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,100
( All gasp )

355
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,036
Lisbeth: The only way
for you to log out

356
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,505
is by dying in there.

357
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,175
That brings me to another issue
you all need to know about.

358
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:53,512
The Underworld doesn't have
a pain absorber function.

359
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,113
( All gasping )

360
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,183
If you take enough damage
to drop your h.P. To zero,

361
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,452
you'll experience
loads of virtual pain.

362
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,120
( All murmuring )

363
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,422
Lisbeth: And finally...

364
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,192
The Underworld's
in a chaotic state right now,

365
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,528
and the devs
can't fully operate it,

366
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:12,197
so once you convert
your character data

367
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,799
to the Underworld,
there's no guarantee

368
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,668
you'll be able
to convert it back.

369
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:19,071
And worse, if you die there,

370
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:22,407
there's a good chance you might
lose your character forever.

371
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:23,408
Player: Did I hear her right?

372
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,409
Player 2: How can she ask that?

373
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,544
Player 3: Hard pass.

374
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,345
Player 4: Yeah,
what's the point?

375
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,947
Player 5: What a load of crap!

376
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,349
If we help
and lose our characters,

377
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,085
are you gonna
reimburse us for 'em?

378
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,353
Or is this a trick
to weaken the tribes

379
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,354
so you can take over!

380
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,956
Klein: Hey!

381
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,157
Lisbeth: You're wrong.

382
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:40,492
We're not tricking you!

383
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,094
( All murmuring )

384
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,362
Lisbeth: We know
how hard you worked

385
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,029
to build your characters up,

386
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,300
and no amount of money
can replace their loss.

387
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,168
We're not asking this lightly.

388
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,036
We're begging you to help us.

389
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:55,107
Right now, our friends are
fighting the American players

390
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,775
alongside the underworlders,

391
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:59,444
but they're outnumbered,
and they need reinforcements!

392
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,446
Player 5: You're all
"s.A.O." Survivors,

393
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:04,182
so you should be tough enough
to deal with it!

394
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,651
Screw your sob story!
You think you're all that,

395
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,320
just 'cause
you were in that game!

396
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,722
Well, here's your chance
to prove how bad-ass you are!

397
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,257
Player 6: Why should we care

398
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,259
about hijackers
or a.I.S with souls?

399
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,194
Player 7: Don't bring
this real-life crap

400
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,196
into our game
and expect us to help!

401
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,399
Player 8: You and
the rest of your "s.A.O." Club

402
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,666
can deal with it!

403
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,201
Player 5:
Go save the day again,

404
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,536
you stuck-up jerks!

405
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:25,637
( Players yelling )

406
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,412
Lisbeth: It didn't work.

407
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,348
No matter what I say,
they don't care.

408
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,385
¶

409
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,568
( Sighs )

410
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:04,709
( Crowd muttering )

411
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,111
( Lisbeth chuckles )

412
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:08,513
You're right!

413
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,449
This is a real-life problem!

414
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,052
And as for us survivors,

415
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:15,854
yeah, some of us
do blur the line

416
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,390
between the real world
and the virtual,

417
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:22,727
but we don't think we're tougher
or better than anyone here.

418
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,529
None of us think we're heroes!

419
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,131
Me and Silica,

420
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,068
she and I go to a special school
for survivors.

421
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:32,471
Once a month, the students
have to go to counseling

422
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,474
'cause of the trauma
we still deal with.

423
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,543
They ask us painful questions.

424
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,879
They make some of the kids
take medication,

425
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,215
even though it makes 'em sick.

426
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,617
And the government,
they're afraid of us,

427
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,953
so they monitor us like we're
a bunch of criminals!

428
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:52,691
The truth is it's not just us
at the returnee school

429
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,093
they're suspicious of.

430
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,629
It's all vrmmo players.

431
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:00,699
They think we're all
a bunch of deadbeats,

432
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,302
losers dragging society down,

433
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,173
cowards who don't pay taxes
and can't face reality.

434
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:10,575
People are saying
we need the draft back,

435
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,712
to force us to enlist, 'cause
at least we can be useful there.

436
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,914
And even though
they think that about us,

437
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,249
you know what I believe?

438
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,718
That this here...

439
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,153
This is reality.

440
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,256
( Singing in Japanese )

441
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:28,793
This world and all the other
virtual worlds connected to it,

442
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,928
they're real.

443
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:32,264
They're not just games we play.

444
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:35,400
Here in v.R.,
I have a real life,

445
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,869
and I have real friends.

446
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:39,804
I laugh, and I cry,
and I feel real feelings,

447
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,740
the same as offline!

448
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:43,408
Isn't it like that for you?!

449
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,744
We pour our hearts and souls
into this world,

450
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,280
because it's different
from what we got out there!

451
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,015
But if it's all
just a stupid game,

452
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:54,352
if everything we've been through
and felt here is fake,

453
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:57,021
if so, then in the end,

454
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,291
what is real for us?!

455
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,427
( Crying )

456
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,363
All the worlds we've grown
fused together.

457
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,766
They're as thick and tall
as the world tree.

458
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,301
And from them...

459
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:13,371
From them, the Underworld
started to bloom.

460
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,174
I want to protect it.

461
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,310
So please,

462
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,579
please...

463
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,513
Help us.

464
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,414
( Blade slashes )

465
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,750
( Pugilists scream )

466
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,685
Bercouli: Don't stop!
Cut the next one!

467
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,287
( Hooves pounding )

468
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:06,090
( Asuna gasps )

469
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,893
( Energy pulsing )

470
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:14,233
( Bercouli gasps )

471
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:16,835
( Asuna gasps )

472
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,708
¶

473
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:36,120
( Gabriel chuckles )

474
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,923
( Red Knights yelling )
