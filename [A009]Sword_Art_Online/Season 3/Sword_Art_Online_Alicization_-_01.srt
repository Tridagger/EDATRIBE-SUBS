to find out who they were

529
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:38,245
and what they were
up to, tough guy.

530
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,014
Klein: Yeah, well,
a win’s a win.

531
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,417
Asuna: That said,
it would have been nice

532
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,185
to find out the leader’s name.

533
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:47,221
Silica: Yeah, but with
the way they fought,

534
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:49,556
it wasn’t even clear
who the leader was.

535
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,791
( Lisbeth yelps )

536
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:52,125
Hey, don’t flop on me!

537
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,794
What do I look like, a pillow?

538
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:56,229
Asuna: He said he’s been
taking time off from school

539
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:58,499
since Thursday
and touring companies.

540
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,401
Sinon: Knowing him,
he’s probably mixed up

541
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,336
in something sinister again.

542
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:04,304
( Kirito sighing )

543
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:08,342
Sinon: Thanks again for helping
me out, guys. You’re the best.

544
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,277
Klein: No probs. Anytime!

545
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,545
Later.

546
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:13,380
Silica: Today was fun!

547
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:14,948
Lisbeth: See ya!

548
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,817
Asuna: Well, bye.

549
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,486
- Sinon: No, wait. One sec.
- Asuna: What’s up?

550
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,856
Sinon: I was hoping you guys
could help me with something.

551
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:24,058
Asuna: That squad of p.K.Ers?

552
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:27,361
sinon: No,
it’s something else, actually.

553
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:33,367
If you and kirito have time,
could we meet I.R.L. Tomorrow?

554
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,235
Asuna: I think so.

555
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,338
Yeah, i’m free in the evening.

556
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:38,973
Do you want to meet at agil’s?

557
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,140
Sinon: Sure.

558
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:42,877
Oh, i’ll also
email you the plan

559
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,045
so you can think about it,
if that’s okay.

560
00:30:45,078 --> 00:30:46,880
Asuna: Sounds good.

561
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,951
( Kirito gasps )

562
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:55,990
Sinon: You’re so thin.
Are you eating?

563
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,225
Kirito: What are you, my mom?

564
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:02,028
Anyway, what is it
you wanted to ask me?

565
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:03,463
Is it about b.O.B.?

566
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:05,032
Sinon: Mm-hmm.

567
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,534
there’s a player
calling himself subtilizer,

568
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:09,236
who won b.O.B. Four.

569
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:12,506
He’s the same guy
who won the first b.O.B.

570
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,974
Kirito: Huh.

571
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:16,343
Sinon: When we found out
he was in four,

572
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,412
everyone got excited, ’cause
he’s like a legend, you know?

573
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,949
Kirito: Yeah. We all
watched the live feed.

574
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:24,985
Can’t believe he started
with just his bare hands.

575
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,387
He fought with a confidant,
stealthy style,

576
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,156
like that team
from the other day.

577
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,525
Sinon: They did have
the same vibe, didn’t they?

578
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,129
Well, except subtilizer’s on
a whole ’nother level than them.

579
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:37,398
( Sighs )

580
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,500
He killed me so fast.

581
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,602
I didn’t even have time to aim.

582
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,338
that’s how it was
for everyone in the tourney.

583
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:47,074
It’s like he knew our moves
before we did.

584
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,475
Kirito: No way. Really?

585
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:50,578
But you’re all vets at b.O.B.

586
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:54,048
How could he anticipate
everyone’s moves like that?

587
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,316
Sinon: I suppose, as vets,

588
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,484
there’s a predictability
to how we play.

589
00:31:57,518 --> 00:32:00,654
We tend to use the same moves,
’cause they work.

590
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:03,390
Which brings me
to why you’re here.

591
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,691
( Kirito sighs )

592
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:06,460
Sinon: I was thinking
that a player

593
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,428
with a more chaotic
fighting style

594
00:32:08,462 --> 00:32:11,532
might have a better chance
at outmaneuvering subtilizer.

595
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:14,301
Anyway, the point
is the next b.O.B.’s

596
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,203
gonna be happening
at the end of the year,

597
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:18,338
and i’d like you
to sign up for it.

598
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:20,007
Kirito: Huh? Uh...

599
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,309
Sinon: There’s no way
i’m gonna let myself lose

600
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:25,178
to the same guy again.
He’s going down.

601
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,716
Kirito: Looks like
you made some progress.

602
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,218
Sinon: O-oh, yeah.

603
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,620
I still get the shakes
every now and then,

604
00:32:33,654 --> 00:32:35,389
but i’m getting better.

605
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,725
Kirito: And your friend,

606
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:39,326
is he doing any better?

607
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,327
( Sinon sighs )

608
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,596
You mean shinkawa.

609
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:45,699
Yeah, he’s making progress.

610
00:32:45,732 --> 00:32:49,502
I’ll probably go visit him
again in a couple days.

611
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,204
Kirito: That’s good.

612
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,207
Well, look on the bright side.

613
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,477
He’s finally getting the help
he needs. Death gun’s over.

614
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,212
Sinon: No, it isn’t.

615
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,247
his partner’s
still out there, remember?

616
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,183
Kirito: Yeah, but kikuoka said

617
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:04,719
they’ll catch up with him
soon enough.

618
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,753
Sinon: Yeah, I hope so.

619
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:07,755
- ( Entry bell rings )
- ( Asuna sighs )

620
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,189
Sorry i’m late!

621
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,158
Hey there, shinonon!

622
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,426
Kirito: What’d you
just call her?

623
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:14,728
Sinon: Hey, asuna.
Right on time.

624
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:18,498
Asuna: I read your email
about b.O.B. Five. I’m in.

625
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:20,768
kirito: Wait.
You asked her to help, too?

626
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:23,137
Sinon: Yup. I figured
if it were just you,

627
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,272
there’s a chance
you’d get too aggro.

628
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,641
Even good dogs
need a leash, right?

629
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,642
Kirito: Dang.

630
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,011
Asuna: Hey, kirito.

631
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:34,147
You’re so thin. Are you eating?

632
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,449
Kirito: Yeah, I am.

633
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:37,017
Sinon: Hah! See?

634
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,052
She can even tell
something’s up.

635
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,721
Asuna: It’s that part-time job,
isn’t it?

636
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,389
Honestly.

637
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,623
Kirito: Uh...

638
00:33:43,657 --> 00:33:46,693
Asuna: Physically,
you’re fine, so far.

639
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,762
Sinon: Wait. You can tell?

640
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:49,796
Eh?

641
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,032
What’s that?

642
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:54,367
Kirito: It’s exactly
what it looks like.

643
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,571
Sinon: Huh?! You mean
she can track your vitals?!

644
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:59,072
Asuna: Neat, huh?

645
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,307
Sinon: Yeah, I guess,

646
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,142
but, like, how’s it work?

647
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:03,544
Kirito: A little while ago,

648
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:07,147
I had this miniature sensor
implanted in my chest.

649
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:09,550
It sends my heart rate,
body temperature,

650
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,119
and other stuff over the net
to asuna’s smartphone.

651
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:14,721
sinon: What?!
Wh-why would you wanna do--

652
00:34:14,755 --> 00:34:18,058
oh, I get it.
It’s an anti-cheating system.

653
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,559
- Kirito: No! Not even!
- Asuna: No! Not even!

654
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:22,229
Kirito: When I started
this part-time job,

655
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,498
they thought
it’d be good to get it.

656
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:27,067
I have to wear electrodes,
and sticking ’em on

657
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,169
and pulling ’em off’s
kind of a hassle.

658
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:33,774
Using it like this was her idea,
so I made a little app for it.

659
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:37,077
Asuna: Yeah, something
about looking at it’s
kind of soothing,

660
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,847
knowing that’s kirito’s heart
beating. ( Sighs )

661
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:43,250
i get all woozy,
and my head starts to spin.

662
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:44,618
( Kirito sighs, chuckles )

663
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:48,355
Sinon: Uh, that’s both cute
and kinda creepy.

664
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,724
A-anyway, with you on my side,

665
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:52,659
i’ll have a machine gun
in my pillbox.

666
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:55,496
You’re exactly the edge I need.

667
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:57,664
Asuna: I’m happy to help
any way I can.

668
00:34:57,698 --> 00:34:58,832
( Kirito chuckles )

669
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,634
- Sinon: Now, then...
- Kirito: What?

670
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,801
Sinon: I wanna hear some more

671
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:04,104
about this sketchy
new job of yours.

672
00:35:04,137 --> 00:35:05,605
Let me guess.

673
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,409
you’re Alpha testing
a new v.R.M.M.O. Game, right?

674
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,779
Kirito: Actually,
it’s not a game.

675
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:14,481
It’s a brain-machine interface

676
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,751
designed for this
brand-new full-dive system.

677
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,853
Rath developed it.
They’re new.

678
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,356
Sinon: What the heck
kind of a name is "rath"?

679
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,625
Asuna: It’s the name
of an imaginary creature.

680
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:27,227
I remember it from the book
"through the looking-glass."

681
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:30,564
Some characters said it was
a pig, and others, a turtle.

682
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:32,232
Sinon: So are they releasing

683
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,802
some next-gen full-dive rig
for gaming?

684
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,905
Kirito: I don’t know. Maybe.

685
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:39,773
This thing’s totally different

686
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,175
compared to the full-dive tech
that’s out now.

687
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:45,679
Sinon: Oh. So what’s
the in-game world like?

688
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:50,150
- Kirito: I have no idea.
- sinon: Huh?

689
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:52,286
Kirito: It’s how they
keep things confidential.

690
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,323
The memories I make using
their rig in the v.R. World,

691
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,892
they don’t stick with me
in the real world.

692
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:01,662
Whatever I saw during the tests,
whatever I did,

693
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:04,598
I forget all of it
after I log out.

694
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,266
- Sinon: Uh, huh?!
- ( Asuna gasps )

695
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,602
Sinon: You can’t remember
anything at all?

696
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,805
oh, my god.
Is it another augma?

697
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,843
Kirito: Uh, n-no.
It’s not like that!

698
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:19,213
This rig doesn’t put stress on
your brain like the augma did.

699
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:21,281
I didn’t lose my memories
or anything.

700
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:23,551
I just can’t access them
from my fluctlight.

701
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,920
- sinon: Uh...
- Asuna: A fluct what?

702
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:29,390
Kirito: This is gonna
take some time to explain.

703
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:30,891
First off,

704
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:34,828
the rig i’m testing’s
called the soul translator.

705
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,367
where in your body
do you think your soul is?

706
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,668
Asuna: Seriously?

707
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:43,938
Sinon: I don’t know.
In the brain?

708
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,940
Kirito: If you zoom in
to the brain,

709
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:48,008
you’ll see
it’s made up of cells.

710
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:52,379
So where in all those cells
do you think the soul is?

711
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:53,747
Sinon: I-I don’t know.

712
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,315
Kirito: Zoom in to a brain cell,

713
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:56,951
and you’ll see
that it has things in it

714
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:58,786
that support
the cell’s structure.

715
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,754
They’re called microtubules.

716
00:37:00,787 --> 00:37:01,755
Sinon: Okay.

717
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,490
Kirito: Like the name implies,

718
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:06,560
they’re like hollow pipes,
but they’re not empty.

719
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:08,829
They got something
sealed inside.

720
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,598
Sinon: So what
do they have inside?

721
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,367
Kirito: Light.

722
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,970
That’s it, fluctuating light.

723
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:19,573
It’s the building block
of the human soul,

724
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:20,807
according to rath.

725
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,943
Asuna: So let me see
if I understand this.

726
00:37:22,976 --> 00:37:27,013
They’re saying this light
in brain cells, that’s the soul?

727
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:28,582
Kirito: Yeah.

728
00:37:28,615 --> 00:37:30,917
They don’t call it
a soul at rath, though.

729
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:32,953
They decided to go
with a combination

730
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:35,722
of the words "fluctuating"
and "light,"

731
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,691
"fluctlight" for short.

732
00:37:37,724 --> 00:37:38,758
Sinon: Huh.

733
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:40,394
Asuna: Then the soul translator

734
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,062
doesn’t just read
a person’s brain.

735
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,663
It reads their fluctlight.

736
00:37:43,697 --> 00:37:46,633
Which means it can
also imprint on them.

737
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,835
Sinon: Imprint?

738
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:49,470
Asuna: Like the amusphere.

739
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:52,506
That rig lets you experience
v.R. By sending images,

740
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,709
sounds, and other sensory
information to your brain.

741
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:58,111
with this rig,
since it’s next-gen and all,

742
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,015
it would work the same way,
but on your soul, right?

743
00:38:01,048 --> 00:38:03,050
Kirito: Yeah, that’s right.

744
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,485
the name
pretty much says it all.

745
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,888
The soul translator, or s.T.L.,

746
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:10,424
writes short-term memories
onto your fluctlight

747
00:38:10,457 --> 00:38:13,460
of the sights and sounds
it wants you to experience.

748
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:17,030
Mnemonic visual data
is what it’s called.

749
00:38:17,064 --> 00:38:21,402
I remember the test dives I took
at the beginning of the job.

750
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:22,736
( Note vibrates )

751
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,371
Those dives were different.

752
00:38:24,404 --> 00:38:26,406
I was blown away.

753
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,143
it’s nothing like
what the amusphere creates.

754
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:31,879
Everything was so real,

755
00:38:31,912 --> 00:38:34,848
I couldn’t tell it was
a virtual world at first.

756
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,718
Asuna: I don’t know.
This scares me.

757
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:41,121
I mean, is it safe?

758
00:38:41,154 --> 00:38:43,923
Mr. Kikuoka offered you the job,
and that’s great,

759
00:38:43,957 --> 00:38:45,892
but who knows
what his motives are?

760
00:38:45,926 --> 00:38:46,994
( Kirito sighs )

761
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:48,595
Yeah, you’re right,

762
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:51,432
but I don’t let my guard down
around him ever.

763
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:54,635
The thing is I wanna know.

764
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:58,605
I have to do this to see
where full-dive’s heading.

765
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,443
I know it’s risky,
but the s.T.L.’s special.

766
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:06,680
Sure terms like "mnemonic"
and "fluctlight" sound creepy,

767
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:07,981
but I connect with it.

768
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,984
Way more than the amusphere.

769
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,653
It’s like a waking dream
when i’m in it.

770
00:39:12,686 --> 00:39:13,954
Asuna: How so?

771
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:16,122
kirito: You know
how you sometimes have dreams

772
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:18,792
that seem long,
the kind where you wake up

773
00:39:18,825 --> 00:39:21,194
and you’d swear that dream
went on for hours,

774
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,831
especially if it
was a nightmare?

775
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:25,666
The truth is, that dream

776
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:27,701
probably only lasted
a few minutes.

777
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:31,538
You get that same phenomena
if you dive with the s.T.L.

778
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:32,673
Sinon: Seriously?

779
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,608
Kirito: It’s just like a dream

780
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:37,444
that felt like hours,
but was only a few minutes.

781
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:41,448
Your time diving with the s.T.L.
Is way longer than your dive.

782
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,016
( Sinon gasps )

783
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,219
Kirito: That’s the main feature
of the s.T.L.

784
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:47,988
rath calls it
fluctlight acceleration,

785
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,191
or f.L.A. For short.

786
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:52,593
Sinon: Whoa.

787
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,194
Asuna: I’m so confused.

788
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,596
Sinon: My head’s spinning.

789
00:39:55,629 --> 00:39:58,232
You were diving
for three whole days,

790
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,834
so how much time
was that in v.R.?

791
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,470
Kirito: Mm, i’m not sure.

792
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,905
It could have been ten days
or a month.

793
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:07,040
I don’t remember how long.

794
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:10,210
When I asked how long,
they wouldn’t tell me,

795
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,980
but they did tell me
the code name of the test world.

796
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:15,015
Sinon: Really? What is it?

797
00:40:15,048 --> 00:40:16,650
Kirito: The underworld.

798
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,985
Sinon: So it’s like
an underground world?

799
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:20,187
Asuna: It’s a reference.

800
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,622
It has to do with "Alice,"
same as rath.

801
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:25,893
"Alice in wonderland"
was the title the book
was published under,

802
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,729
but it had a different title
when it was being written.

803
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,897
Originally it was called

804
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,000
"alice’s adventures
under ground."

805
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,067
( Kirito sighs )

806
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,103
Sinon: You okay?

807
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:38,271
Kirito: When I heard
the name "Alice,"

808
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:41,041
it felt like I was
about to remember something.

809
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,043
Sinon: Something about the test?

810
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,611
Kirito: I’m not sure.

811
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,781
it feels like
there’s something I need to do.

812
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:50,150
I just can’t remember what.

813
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:52,753
( Asuna sighs )

814
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,788
Sinon: Thanks, agil.

815
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:55,989
See you later!

816
00:40:56,023 --> 00:40:57,858
- Agil: Bye, guys!
- ( Entry bell rings )

817
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,233
Sinon: I’ll keep you guys
up to date about b.O.B.

818
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,735
thanks again
for meeting up with me today.

819
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,771
asuna: Sure!
See you later, shinonon!

820
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:11,905
Sinon: See you.

821
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,808
Asuna: That was fun.

822
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:15,876
Eh?

823
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:17,110
What’s wrong?

824
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,312
Kirito: Say what?

825
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,848
Oh. Nothing.

826
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,816
♪

827
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,089
( Sighs )

828
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,059
( Asuna sighs )

829
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:39,533
Talk to me.

830
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:43,604
Kirito: Asuna...

831
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:48,075
I think i’m gonna go.

832
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:50,043
- Asuna: To America?
- Kirito: Yeah.

833
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:53,247
the research is
way more advanced there.

834
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,816
It’s all next-gen stuff.

835
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:57,584
They’re creating a new world,

836
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:01,122
and I wanna be there
when it’s born.

837
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:02,288
( Asuna chuckles )

838
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:04,357
We were happy in aincrad.

839
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:07,828
but there was
so much pain and sadness, too.

840
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,129
You want to find out

841
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:11,364
why that castle still
haunts your thoughts

842
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:14,635
and where that experience
is taking you.

843
00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:16,904
Kirito: Even if I lived
a couple hundred years,

844
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:18,906
I doubt i’d ever find that out.

845
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:22,810
Anyway, I-I want...

846
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:27,013
I want you with me,
asuna, always.

847
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,750
I want you to come with me,

848
00:42:29,783 --> 00:42:33,987
and I-I know that’s asking
a lot, but the truth is...

849
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,657
I can’t do this without you!

850
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,991
( Asuna gasps )

851
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:40,361
( Sighs )

852
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:45,699
of course.
I’ll go anywhere with you.

853
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:49,336
It doesn’t matter where.
i’ll go.

854
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,971
Kirito: Asuna.

855
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:02,416
( Footsteps echoing )

856
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,651
Asuna: So does this mean
the soul translator

857
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,120
isn’t the next step in v.R.?

858
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:09,223
Hearing you talk about it,
I thought it was.

859
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,326
Kirito: Eh, I don’t know.

860
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,662
for some reason,
I get the feeling its purpose

861
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:18,065
isn’t just to full-dive
in v.R. Worlds.

862
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:19,766
Asuna: Then what’s it for?

863
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,135
Kirito: A tool for learning

864
00:43:21,168 --> 00:43:23,904
about fluctlights
and human consciousness.

865
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,338
Asuna: Hmm?

866
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:26,840
Kirito: It’s like...

867
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:30,177
Whatever I know about the s.T.L.
Makes me think

868
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,246
it might be an extension
of kayaba’s ideas.

869
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,049
( Asuna gasps )
He’s behind it?!

870
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:38,419
Kirito: I don’t know why he
made the nervegear and "s.A.O."

871
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:41,822
To trap everyone
and make us all suffer

872
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:44,057
or why he’d fry his own brain.

873
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:48,395
And the seed, he didn’t make it
just to keep v.R. Alive.

874
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:51,732
i wanna know
what his endgame was,

875
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:53,267
but I don’t want it to be mine.

876
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,202
I’m not his puppet,

877
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:58,004
and if I go down that road,
I would be.

878
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,373
Asuna: You said
you talked to him

879
00:43:59,406 --> 00:44:01,708
or the part of him
he left behind.

880
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,143
Kirito: Yeah.

881
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:06,881
I think I know why he left
a copy of himself out there,

882
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,716
and it might
have something to do

883
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:11,418
with what rath’s up to
with the s.T.L.

884
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:12,919
- Eh?
- Asuna: Eh?

885
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:15,889
Man: Hey, sorry to bother you.

886
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:19,059
I’m sorta lost.
Where’s the station?

887
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,127
Asuna: Oh, just down there.

888
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:24,765
Kirito?

889
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:27,134
Kirito: You followed us
from dicey’s cafe.

890
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:28,735
( Man sighs )

891
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:31,038
There goes my plan
to ambush y’all.

892
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,139
Kirito: Who are you?

893
00:44:32,172 --> 00:44:34,041
Man: Ah, come on, kirito.

894
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:35,842
Don’t you recognize me?

895
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:40,848
oh. That’s right.
I always wore a mask back there.

896
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:43,250
Yeah, now that
xaxa’s been caught,

897
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:46,820
there’s no one left
to finish things but me,

898
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:49,824

of laughing coffin...

Kirito: So you’re
still on the run?

Johnny: Of course!

905

Damn, kirito. ( Laughs )

906
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:12,179
I can’t believe
you’re the same dude

907
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:14,181
that beat the hell outta us!

908

But you’re just a punk-ass kid,
ain’t you?

909

Take away your swords,
and you’re nothing.

Kirito: What about you?

911
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,990
You don’t have
your poison dagger.

Johnny: I don’t?
