i was just thinking
how strange your moves are.

361
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,310
If you performed them
at the midsummer festival,

362
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,310
you would attract
quite an audience.

Thanks for the compliment.

the midsummer festival before?

it was only for commoners.

going to the academy with.
