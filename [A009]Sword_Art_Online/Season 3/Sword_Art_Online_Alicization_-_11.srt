for a day and a half,

180
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:04,672
but it feels way longer.

181
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,675

182
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,210

humbert’s arm flying off

185

and raios screaming as he died.

186
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,652
Kirito: Get that stuff
out of your head.

187
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:20,820
Start thinking about
what we’re gonna do next.

188
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,758
Eugeo: I don’t know
what that could be.

189
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,362
you know,
you’re absolutely right.

190
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,165
We have to find a way
to break out of this cell

191
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,201
and then figure out
what happened to Alice.

192
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,936
Kirito: Yeah.

193
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,705
if there’s a way out
of this place, we’ll find it.

194
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,074
Eugeo: I wonder...

195
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,944
Did they bring Alice here
eight years ago?

196
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,345
Kirito: I don’t know. Maybe.

197
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:47,081
( Sighs )

198
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,949
Since you brought her up,

199
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,318
I just wanna be sure
of something.

200
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:55,155
The knight that calls herself
Alice synthesis thirty,

201
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,791
you’re positive that she’s

202
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,060
the same Alice
you’re looking for?

203
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,627
Eugeo: Yeah, I am.

204
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,864
those blue eyes,
golden hair, and that voice,

205
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,298
i’d never forget them.

206
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,035
but she seemed like
a totally different person.

207
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,736
Kirito: For someone
who’s supposed to be

208
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,339
your childhood friend,
she whacked you pretty good.

209
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,941
But if you want my opinion,
it could be

210
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,411
she’s under some kind
of mind control or something.

211
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,379
Eugeo: But I don’t remember
seeing spells like that

212
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,814
in any of our textbooks.

213
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,817
kirito: Right,
but the high-ranking priests

214
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,186
in the church
can manipulate life.

215
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:28,889
If they can do that, they can
control someone’s mind, too.

216
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,159
Although, if that knight
really is your Alice,

217
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,361
whose voice did I hear...

218
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,797
Two years ago in the cave?

219
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,935
Girl: Kirito, eugeo,
come and find me.

220
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:43,204
I am waiting...

221
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:48,141
at the top
of the central cathedral.

222
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,314
I will wait there for you both.

223
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:57,084
Eugeo: Right. You told me that.

224
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,952
When you and selka
were healing me,

225
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,387
you said you heard a voice

226
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,322
and then saw something
that looked like Alice.

227
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,391
kirito: Yeah.
She said she’d wait for us

228
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,326
at the top
of the central cathedral.

229
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,263
And now we’re stuck.

230
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:13,434
( Gasps )

231
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,471
Hey, do you think
we can access

232
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,106
the stacia windows
on these chains?

233
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,475
Eugeo: I never even
thought to try that.

234
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,943
Give it a shot.

235
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:23,910
Kirito: ’kay.

236
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,816
Whoa. It worked.

237
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:36,424
Eugeo: Ah, we could pull
on these chains forever,

238
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,991
and they’d never budge.

239
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,194
if we’re going
to break free of them,

240
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,863
we need to get our hands
on a tool or weapon

241
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,464
that’s at least class 38.

242
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:46,800
( Kirito grunts )

243
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,969

what you’re thinking,

246

but the only things
we have in here

247
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,946
are a couple of beds,
water skins, and these chains.

248
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,916
Kirito: A pair of chains.

We got these chains,

252
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:11,992
two of these suckers,

253
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,260
just what we need.

254
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,128

Hang on. I have a question.

257
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,944
Is your idea to use the chains
against one another?

258
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:31,545
Kirito: It totally is.

259
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:34,247
These chains of ours have
the same durability level.

260
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,949
We’d need something

261
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,186
with an object control authority
over 40 to break ’em,

262
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,088
but if we snap ’em
against each other,

263
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,123
that should wear ’em down.

264
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:44,558

remember,
by breaking out of this cell

285

and looking
for the truth about Alice,

286
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:48,989
we’re defying the axiom church
and its laws.

287
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,858
That means from now on,
there’s no time

288
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,428
for second-guessing
or hesitation.

289
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:58,098
you better make sure
you’re prepared for that now.

290
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,566

you should stay here.

If I can return home with Alice,

294
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:11,111
defying the church
isn’t even a question.

295
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:14,180
I’ll even draw my sword
against them if I have to.

296
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:18,518
I want to make sure that knight
is Alice, and, if she is,

00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,555
i’ll find a way to change her
back to the way she was.

353
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:29,410
You’re worried i’ll find a way

354
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,679
to get my memories back
in that tower, aren’t you?

355

Stop it! Let me go!

Kirito: Man, I told you before
not to worry, and I meant it.

361
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:48,428
Whether I get my memories back
or not, we make a great team,

362

Stop treating me like a kid.

It’s not that I don’t trust you
to keep your word.

366

You’ve only mentioned it
a million times so far.

367
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,743
But when I think
about how our journey

368
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:07,848
might be coming to an end,
I feel--i don’t know.

369
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:11,885
Kirito: The fact is
it’s gonna end one day,

370
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,888
but don’t forget
what that’s gonna mean.

371
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,857
You’ll get alice’s memory back,

372
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,825
and then you’re
gonna take her home.

373
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,896
There’s another good thing
that’ll come out of it.

374
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,498
You’ll get to pick
another calling.

375
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:27,134
it might last
the rest of your life,

376
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,237
so you better start thinking
about what you want.

377
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,306
Eugeo: I think I still have
a bit of time to decide.

378
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,641
I know whatever I pick

379
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,677

Kirito: Mentor?

to camp out here for the night

389
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,880

I was skeptical you’d show up,

here’s a warning for you, then.

go back there without a fight,
