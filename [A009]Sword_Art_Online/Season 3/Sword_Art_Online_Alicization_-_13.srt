1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,210
Cardinal: Under the all-powerful
administrator’s rule,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,220
this world entered
a long period of peace,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,980
and the people became apathetic.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,790
70 years had passed since
quinella became administrator.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,860
Then, one day,

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,700
she realized
she’d undergone a change.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,400
She used her control command

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,170
to examine her fluctlight
and discovered

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,370
it had reached its capacity
to retain her memories.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,680
She refused to accept it,

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,180
so she came up with
another monstrous solution.

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,280
Administrator: Welcome, child.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,790
Please, come closer.

14

overwrite her fluctlight

with a copy of the thoughts
and memories from my own,

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,860
I will never lose them.

18

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,370
( Girl whimpers )

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,740
cardinal: It was
a diabolical ceremony...

21
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,340
A fusing of soul and memory

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,910
which she called
the synthesis ritual.

23
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,920
With it, she could seize control
of another human’s fluctlight.

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,050
and here was
where administrator,

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,690
or quinella,
made a critical mistake.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,220
Kirito: What do you mean?

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,030
Cardinal: It didn’t occur to her
that, during the process

28
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,060
of taking over the young girl
and deleting her old self,

29
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,900
there would be a split second

30
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,670
where two gods with equal power
existed at the same time.

31
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,140
Kirito, you are familiar

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,240
with my original version,
are you not?

33
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,780
What is the main feature
of the cardinal system?

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,850

35
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,920

to operate automatically

36

for long periods of time.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,150
It doesn’t need humans to run.

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,990
Cardinal: That is correct,
and, to facilitate it,

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,390
the cardinal system
has two core programs,

40
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,060
a main process and a subprocess.

41
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,300
The main process performs
balance controls on the system.

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,900
Kirito: While the subprocess
runs error checks on the main.

43
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,600
Cardinal: Precisely.

44
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,040
When she became administrator,
the preservation of order

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,240
wasn’t the only thing quinella
etched onto her fluctlight.

46

In the recesses of her soul,

47
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,950
i still functioned
as the subprocess to her main,

So, for 200 years,

150
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,970
you had critters like her out
in the world looking for help,

151
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,900
and you’ve been stuck
in here the whole time?

152
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,240
Cardinal: Indeed,
and, as I sat here

153
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,270
observing the world
through their eyes,

154
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,910
a question kept repeating.

155
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,050
Why would the gods
of the outside

156
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,950
abandon a world they created

157
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,190
to suffer under the tyranny
of administrator, a false god?

158
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,960
As I pondered this and referred
to the cardinal system’s

159
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,090
built-in database over and over,

160
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,260
I eventually arrived
at a conclusion.

161
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,660
Rath may be the god here,

162
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,200
but it doesn’t want the people
to lead happy lives at all.

163
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,770
It wants the opposite.

164
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a test.

165
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,770
Rath created the underworld

166
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,140
so they can observe
how its people react

167
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,710
to stress parameters
put upon them.

168
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,820
Day by day, they increase.

169
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,750
Eventually all those stressors
will reach their limit,

170
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,350
and the final phase of the test
will be at hand.

171
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,790
Kirito: Then what happens?

172
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,160
Cardinal: What these people
fear the most,

173
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,130
an invasion
from outside this realm.

174
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,830
Kirito: The dark territory.

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,630
Cardinal: Correct. The world
of darkness was created

176
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,000
to subject the underworldians
to the ultimate agony.

177
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,270
The monsters there have
fluctlights, just like humans.

178
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,640
The difference is,
their prime directive

179
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,950
is to plunder and slaughter.

180
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,280
They’re eager for the day

181
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,580
when they can breach
the land of the iums,

182
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,220
as they call you,
and wreak havoc.

183
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,950
That day is coming.

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,960
Kirito: And administrator,
does she know they’re coming?

185
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,630
cardinal: Yes,
but she underestimates them.

186
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,660
she thinks she
and her integrity knights

187
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,570
are strong enough to repel them.

188
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,340
she even had
all four guardian dragons slain,

189
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,800
north, south, east, and west.

190
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,210
as allies,
they would have been valuable,

191
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,740
but she could not control them.

192
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,780
Pity, she cannot win now,

193
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,210
for the forces of darkness
are too many,

194
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,150
and her numbers are too few.

195
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,750
Kirito: Hang on. If that’s true,

196
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,650
then why bother takin’ her down?

197
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,990
’cause it sounds like
the fate of this world’s sealed

198
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,220
whether you do or don’t.

199
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,290
Cardinal: You are correct.

200
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
( Kirito gasps )

201
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,860
Cardinal: No matter what I do,

202
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,830
the dark territory
will invade the human realm,

203
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,770
and there is no stopping it.

204
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,840
kirito: So, like,
once you stop administrator,

205
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
your job here’s done,

206
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,270
and whatever else happens
happens.

207
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,980
You don’t care, do you?

208
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,350
Cardinal: Perhaps I don’t.

209
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,980
However...

210
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,220
rath engineered
the bloodshed that is to come.

211
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,360
I cannot accept
a god who does that.

212
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,690
Once I learned the stress test
was unavoidable, I decided.

213
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,830
The human realm
and the dark territory

214
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
must be returned to nothingness.

215
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,940
Kirito: Hold up. Decided?

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,370
Cardinal: That is what I said.

217
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,340
When I regain control,

218
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,040
I will access the fluctlights
stored in the lightcube cluster.

219
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,250
Then I will delete
every resident

220
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,950
of the realms
of humanity and darkness.

221
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,720
- ( Kirito shudders )
- Cardinal: That said,

222
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,790
if you decide to help me
and I eliminate administrator,

223
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,090
I will have full access
to all of my authority.

224
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,360
then, before I
extinguish this world,

225
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,330
I can Grant you one wish,

226
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
to a certain degree, anyway.

227
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,430
if you single out
those you would like to save,

228
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,240
i will refrain
from deleting their fluctlights.

229
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,210
- Instead, I will archive them.
- ( Kirito gasps )

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,610
Cardinal: After you escape
to the real world,

231
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,310
you can save their lightcubes.

232
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,680
I should be able
to set aside ten or so.

233
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,920
( Kirito gasps )

234
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,120
I gotta pick?

235
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,260
Wait a sec.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,660
Something doesn’t add up here.

237
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,030
You said your soul’s
a copy of hers.

238
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,160
that means
you got the selfish part

239
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,400
of the nobility in you, too,

240
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,370
the drive to put your wants
and needs above everyone else’s.

241
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,640
So why’d you wait here all
by yourself and for 200 years?

242
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,680
You could have found a place
far away from administrator

243
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,250
and had some kinda life.

244
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,710
( Cardinal sighs )

245
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,650
The cardinal subprocess
was burned into me.

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,190
That means my core desires
amount to only one thing,

247
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,690
to eliminate administrator and
restore normal function here.

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,960
To me, there is no way to have
a properly functioning world,

249
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,000
unless the corrupting element
is dealt with

250
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,130
and the slate wiped clean.

251
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,270
Actually, on second thought...

252
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,200
( Kirito sighs )

253
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,740
Cardinal: Perhaps you’re right.

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,170
I do harbor one desire,

255
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
something I was
desperate to experience

256
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:17,950
just once
for the last 200 years.

257
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,080
kirito,
would you stand up, please?

258
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,120
Kirito: Uh...

259
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,760
( Cardinal groans )

260
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,390
Kirito: Uh...

261
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,300
Cardinal: This should do.

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,630
All right, please step forward.

263
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,900
- Come closer.
- Kirito: Why?

264
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,900
Cardinal: Don’t argue with me!

265
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,310
Raise your arms, please.

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,310
Kirito: Like this?

267
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,640
Cardinal: In front of you,

268
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,950
and make a circle with them.

269
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,950
Kirito: Uh...

270
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,350
Cardinal: Honestly,
how dense are you?

271
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,330
So this is it.

272
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,760
Now I see.

273
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,900
this is
what it means to be human.

274
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,170
( Kirito grunts )

275
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,600
( Cardinal gasps )

276
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,740
To be held,

277
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,780
it’s so warm and comforting.

278
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,950
after 200 years,
this makes the wait worth it.

279
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,020
To think something so simple
could be so satisfying.

280
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,290
the wait
was more than worth it.

281
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,660
- ( Robe flaps )
- ( Kirito gasps )

282
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,830
Cardinal: Hmm?

283
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,970
Well? How long are you planning

284
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,670
to stand there like that?

285
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,640
Kirito: Sorry. Just bein’ human!

286
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,310
Cardinal: So then,
what’s your decision?

287
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,010
Kirito: Uh...

288
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,050
Cardinal: Will you help me
stop administrator or not?

289
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,680
( Kirito sighs )

290
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,050
Yeah, okay.

291
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,050
I’ll help you with this plan
of yours, sort of.

292
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,750
Cardinal: Huh?

293
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,960
Kirito: Look, I get where
you’re coming from and all,

294
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,090
but i’m not gonna give up
on this world,

295
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,000
and I won’t give up
on its people.

296
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,870
I’ll help you, but i’ll still
try and find a way to save ’em.

297
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,870
Cardinal: Honestly,
your optimism is absurd.

298
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,640
Kirito: Maybe so,

299
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,170
but if everything gets deleted,
so do you.

300
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,780
( Cardinal gasps )

301
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,040
kirito: If I can’t
figure this out, you can bet

302
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,050
you’ll be one of the ten people
i’m gonna want saved.

303
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,050
( Cardinal sighs )

304
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,250
Could you be any more foolish?

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,820
How do you expect me
to extinguish this world

306
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,220
if I am not present
to perform the task?

307
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,890
kirito: Don’t know.
Hey, i’ll do whatever you say,

308
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,330
but i’m gonna try to come up

309
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,260
with a better solution
all the same.

310
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,230
( Cardinal groans )

311
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,900
Someday, you, too, will know
the bitterness of resignation.

312
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,870
It is not the same
as trying and failing.

313
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,240
It is being forced
to admit failure,

314
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,280
regardless of how hard you try.

315
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,350
( Footsteps approaching )

316
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,350
( Eugeo sighs )

317
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
Kirito: There you are!

318
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,990
we thought
you were still in the bath.

319
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,500
eugeo: I’m sorry.
I guess I lost track of time.

320
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,670
kirito: So, uh,
cardinal and I were talkin’.

321
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,870
She used to be the--
the pontifex here

322
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,670
’til administrator kicked
her out and took over her job.

323
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,040
Eugeo: You were a pontifex?

324
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,940
Kirito: Don’t worry.
She’s on our side.

325
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,540
She’s gonna help us fight
the integrity knights.

326
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,610
- Eugeo: Y-you will?
- Kirito: Yeah.

327
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,850
She wants to get her title
as pontifex back,

328
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,480
but to do that,

329
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,790
she’s gonna have to take down
administrator first,

330
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,150
so, like, she sort of
suggested we join forces.

331
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,160
Cardinal: Mm-hmm.

332
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,030
Eugeo: There’s this girl,

333
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,060
an integrity knight
called Alice synthesis thirty.

334
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,730
I think she’s the same person
as an Alice zuberg from rulid.

335
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,030
Do you know if she is?

336
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,470
Cardinal: I’m sorry,
but the information

337
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,370
i’m able to access here
is extremely limited.

338
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,510
I know integrity knight Alice
was born, but no other details.

339
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,880
However, I can tell you how
to undo the synthesis ritual,

340
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,680
the sacred art
that creates integrity knights.

341
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,420
( Eugeo gasps )
And how do I do that?

342
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,690
Cardinal: Simply remove
the piety module.

343
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,920
All the knights have one
in their forehead.

344
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,060
It looks like
a triangular prism.

345
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,690
( Eugeo gasps ) We saw one.

346
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,860
Cardinal: Once the piety module
is inserted,

347
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,770
it effectively blocks
the links to memories.

348
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,470
With that, the prospective
knight’s past is sealed away--

349
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,640
the result, a knight
who is loyal to the church

350
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,880
and to their creator,
the pontifex.

351
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,080
Kirito: We almost broke
the spell on one of ’em.

352
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,380
We reminded him
of who he used to be,

353
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,680
and the crystal popped out.

354
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,950
Cardinal: That is not enough
to free a knight.

355
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,950
Another element is required
in order to break the spell.

356
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Eugeo: And? What would that be?

357
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,090
Cardinal: The thing
that once existed

358
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,890
in the place
where the module was inserted,

359
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,700
or, more specifically,
a memory fragment,

360
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,070
one the integrity knight
treasures the most.

361
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,000
Administrator is
a cautious woman.

362
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,770
I don’t doubt she keeps

363
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,970
all the memory fragments
close at hand.

364
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
if anywhere,
they’d be in her chamber,

365
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,710
located on the top floor
of the central cathedral.

366
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,020
kirito: Okay,
so to turn the knights

367
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,680
back to the way they were,

368
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,490
we need to get our hands
on their memory fragments.

369
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,060
but I doubt
the integrity knights

370
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,860
are just gonna let us
walk up to administrator’s room.

371
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,060
I bet we’re gonna have
to fight every one of ’em

372
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,930
all the way
to the top of the cathedral.

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,960
Cardinal: Don’t be naive.

374
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,030
An integrity knight
does not stop

375
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,600
until either you
or they are dead.

376
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,910
I can help you get equipment
that is equal to theirs,

377
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,910
but that is
all the assistance I can offer.

378
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,080
The rest will be
up to your skills

379
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,650
and whether you have
the stamina to endure.

380
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,020
Eugeo: If Alice shows up
and I have to fight her,

381
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,820
I-I don’t want to hurt her.

382
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,450
I can’t.

383
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,590
I just want to take her
back to our village.

384
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,390
Cardinal: I know. I understand.

385
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,390
Your intention is honorable,

386
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,860
and I have an idea that should
satisfy you, so don’t fret.

387
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,030
When you come across
Alice the knight,

388
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,800
you’ll be armed with something
that won’t kill her.

389
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,000
I made them special.

390
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,910
Kirito: Daggers?

391
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,480
Cardinal: Obviously.

392
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,080
whoever they Pierce
will be instantly linked to me

393
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,850
in this library
by an unbreakable connection.

394
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,920
the person
will then be susceptible

395
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,490
to whatever sacred art I cast.

396
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,490
Take them. All you have to do
is Pierce her flesh

397
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,490
with just one
of those daggers.

398
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,090
in that instant,
I will use my sacred arts

399
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,960
to put her into a deep sleep.

400
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,470
She will stay that way until you
have her memory fragment

401
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,570
and are ready
to remove the synthesis.

402
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,970
Eugeo: All right, then.

403
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,470
If I can’t manage
to talk sense into her,

404
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,040
I will use your daggers.

405
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,610
Cardinal: Actually, one of those
is intended for administrator.

406
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,010
the other one
is supposed to be a spare.

407

Either way, who gets stabbed
with which is up to you now.

409
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,960
- Wait. We still need gear.
- Cardinal: Hmm?

410
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,890
Kirito: You said
you’d help us get stuff

411
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,630
that’s equal
to what the knights have.

412
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,790
Cardinal: You and eugeo have
powerful swords of your own,

413
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,460
do you not?

414
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,800
Those should be more than equal
to what any knight has.

415
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,470
Eugeo: Does that mean
what I think it does?

416
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,400
Can you get our swords back?

417
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,440
Cardinal: Of course.
There is an armory

418
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,470
on the third floor
of the cathedral.

419
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,680
That is most likely
where they are being kept.

420
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,050
kirito: By the way,
how far up do we have to go

421
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,010
to get to administrator’s room?

422
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,050
Cardinal: Each year,
the central cathedral

423
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,090
grows taller than the last,

424
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,050

you need to do.

called perfect weapon control.

436
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,710
Cardinal: Once they
activate the spell,

437

divine weapons
take on the properties

438

of the thing
the weapon once was.

439
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,960
In other words, perfect control
releases the weapon’s memory.

440
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,830
as a result,
it can unleash potent attacks

441
