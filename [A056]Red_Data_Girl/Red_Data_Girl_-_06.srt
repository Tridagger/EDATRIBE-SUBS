00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:48,416
I have to admit...
Haguro...

186
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,958
I was surprised
to hear that

187
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,208
you'd attended
there.

188
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,958
Oh, have you
been as well, sir?

189
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,291
Well, Togakushi and Haguro
share common ground

190
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,291
through Shugendou, after all.

191
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,333
Anyway...

192
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:00,416
Why don't you
tell me about...

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
[MANATSU] Izumiko!

194
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,875
Do you want
some fruit punch?

195
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:04,666
[IZUMIKO] Sure...

196
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
that sounds great, thanks.

197
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:09,833
[MANATSU] Here!

198
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:11,375
It looks delicious.

199
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,833
I meant to ask you...

200
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,958
Have you ever heard of the MSF?

201
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,000
Huh?

202
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,833
[IZUMIKO] Is it some
kind of club...?

203
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,625
Maybe one you belong to?

204
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,375
Ha, you gotta
be kidding me...

205
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,583
Me, belong to
Mayura's fan club?

206
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,083
[IZUMIKO] A fan club?

207
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,791
[GRAD GIRL 1] Hey Manatsu!

208
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,291
Seriously,
good joke.

209
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,791
Never thought I'd
hear it from you.

210
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,041
[GRAD GIRL 1] What's
this I hear about you

211
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,458
not having a girlfriend?

212
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,458
[MANATSU] Ugh!

213
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,166
You're gonna bring
that up again?

214
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,166
[GRAD GIRL 1] Oh yeah.

215
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,000
I get it.

216
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,833
The Mayura Souda Fan Club...

217
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:44,333
M...

218
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,041
S...

219
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,458
and F.

220
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:49,666
[IZUMIKO] That's strange...

221
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,791
I wonder why Miyuki told me
to ask around about it.

222
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,458
Hojou must be a
remarkable place

223
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,875
for that to happen.

224
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,333
The school does
have a nice sense

225
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,500
of independence from the
rest of the world.

226
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,375
[PROF. SOUDA] I see!

227
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,083
I guess that's not surprising.

228
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,875
You should try
to relax more...

229
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,416
You worry far too much
for a girl your age.

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,250
[IZUMIKO] Mayura, Manatsu,
and Miyuki all look like normal

231
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,916
high school students
on the outside.

232
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,750
Hey, Izumiko?

233
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:17,708
What's wrong...?

234
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,375
You're acting weird.

235
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:19,875
Oh, no.

236
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:20,875
I'm fine...!

237
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,125
Really, I feel
nice and fluffy.

238
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,000
Fluffy, huh?

239
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,458
[MAYURA] How much
of that did you have?

240
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,250
Oh my gosh, we put a bunch
of liquor in the syrup!

241
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,375
Crap, that's bad...!

242
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,708
Seriously bad!

243
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,916
Miyuki, you're so
silly, Miyuki.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,166
You're kidding me...

245
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,500
Okay, look, go lay down
for a little while.

246
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,625
[MIYUKI] How do
you sober someone up?

247
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,916
Coffee, maybe?

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,416
She wouldn't take over
my body, would she?

249
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,875
That wouldn't be fair.

250
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,375
Not when I feel so lovely.

251
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,875
Man, this is so not good!

252
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,250
Wow, that was
a big fall...!

253
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,666
Are you okay?

254
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,791
Mayura's in bed already?

255
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,500
What time is it now...?

256
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,041
I wonder if Manatsu and
Mikyuki are still awake.

257
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,375
Looks like everyone
else is tired too.

258
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,666
[MASUMI] You're
going the wrong way.

259
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,791
Here...

260
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,708
I'm over here.

261
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:05,708
[IZUMIKO] Oh...

262
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,500
it's him!

263
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,625
Hello there, Masumi!

264
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,916
Hey, you're Suzuhara...

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,666
Is that right?

266
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,291
It's so nice that
you remembered me.

267
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,208
But, uh...

268
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,708
what are you
doing out here?

269
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,458
I certainly wasn't
expecting to see you...

270
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,833
Not here...

271
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,958
even Manatsu and Mayura
couldn't find me right now.

272
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,416
You like to come
home sometimes

273
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,375
when no one else is around?

274
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,916
[MASUMI] No, being home
has nothing to do with it.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,458
Oh...

276
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,583
I see...!

277
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,208
This all must be
part of my dream!

278
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,875
No one told me
you were so funny...

279
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,500
Really, you are.

280
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,875
You know, you're the first
person to ever talk to me

281
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,166
without the other two around.

282
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,666
[IZUMIKO] Really?

283
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,416
I am?

284
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,958
[MASUMI] Hey, Suzuhara...

285
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,250
mind if I flirt with you?

286
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,625
Huh?

287
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:13,875
We should
go out together...

288
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,166
It could be very nice.

289
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,041
Do you get what
you're saying?

290
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:18,708
Let's say...

291
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,958
yes.

292
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,833
[IZUMIKO] That makes one
of us, because I don't...

293
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:27,458
What does that kind of thing
even mean over on this side?

294
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,833
Well, you can
learn at Togakushi.

295
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,125
Let's meet up there.

296
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,208
Sound good?

297
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,500
All that fruit.

298
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:45,750
If you had just
stopped eating it,

299
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,875
everything would have been fine.

300
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:48,875
Man, Shinkou
scared the

301
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,416
crap out of me...

302
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,708
He seriously
lost his cool.

303
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,416
Just shut up.

304
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,916
[KISARAGI] Morning!

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,458
Hope we didn't keep you waiting.

306
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,458
Oh, no...

307
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,458
We haven't been here long.

308
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,750
[KISARAGI] Good, it looks like
everyone's already here...

309
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,083
Go ahead, Souda...

310
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,208
We're all in your hands
for this part of the trip.

311
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,833
Just leave it up to me...

312
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,916
After all...

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,083
I'm the one who
suggested camping here.

314
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,791
[FEMALE TOUR GUIDE] Mount
Togakushi's name originates

315
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,708
from the myth of Amaterasu,
who hid in a cave and blocked

316
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,291
the entrance with a boulder...

317
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,458
When Amenitajikoro no Mikoto
forced the cave open,

318
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,208
he threw the boulder,
and one of its pieces

319
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,750
became this mountain.

320
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,750
The deity celebrated

321
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,500
at Togakushi Shrine is a
great nine-headed dragon...

322
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,458
Since ancient times,
Mt. Hiei and Mt. Kouya have--

323
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,208
[IZUMIKO] It's different
than Tamakura...

324
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,708
But in some ways, it's the same.

325
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:47,166
They are both sacred mountains.

326
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,333
[KISARAGI] This is nice.

327
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,458
Do you come and stay
at this inn every year?

328
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,458
[MAYURA] No, not necessarily...

329
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,750
There is an equestrian
club in the area that I go

330
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,208
way back with, though.

331
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,208
Interesting that you
should mention clubs.

332
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,625
Isn't the History Society
that you happen to belong

333
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:09,541
to also on a camping trip...?

334
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,125
Right next door?

335
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,541
What are you up to?

336
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,791
Whoa, I'm not up
to anything...!

337
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,958
What would even
make you think that?

338
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,333
Everyone knows the
History Society is really

339
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,750
just another name for
your stupid fan club...

340
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:23,916
We also know that you're
trying to win over members

341
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
of the Executive Committee...

342
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,625
If you try to take over
the Student Council...

343
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,583
don't expect to be successful.

344
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:32,208
Where's this
all coming from...?

345
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,625
Look, I would never--
It's not fair...!

346
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,625
I haven't done anything
to deserve that accusation!

347
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:38,916
What are you trying to say?

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,041
That I can't join
the Executive Committee?

349
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,291
Sorry, I don't
think that's

350
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,833
what Reina
meant to imply.

351
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,583
She came off a bit too
strong with her comments...

352
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,041
but this is something we want
to make clear from the start.

353
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,625
The Executive Committee will not
shun anyone wishing to join...

354
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,625
but we are adamant about
remaining neutral...

355
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,333
We will not participate in
any of the games on campus...

356
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,875
Do you know why?

357
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,583
We have a responsibility
as judges.

358
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:05,666
Huh?

359
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,541
I'm a judge.

360
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,166
I possess the power of a Saniwa.

361
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,791
You're the judges.

362
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,541
[KISARAGI] Don't bother denying
that you created the MSF.

363
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,000
Or that you've been working
very hard to put yourself

364
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,750
in a favorable position.

365
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,416
Takayanagi was working behind
the scenes, as well...

366
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,791
However...

367
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:25,125
bear in mind the Student Council
isn't easily swayed.

368
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,041
[MAYURA]
I understand...

369
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
I'll be careful.

370
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:34,875
Now then...

371
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,750
this is a great
summer retreat...

372
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:39,333
I would just hate to ruin the
experience with bickering...

373
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't you agree?

374
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,041
[KISARAGI] All right!

375
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,833
We'll begin the meeting
about the fall festival.

376
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,250
The Committee Director,

377
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,416
second year Yoshiki Hayakawa,
is currently attending

378
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,458
baseball camp...

379
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,125
so we'll proceed without him...

380
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,166
As we decided the other day,
the theme will be

381
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,833
the Warring States Era...

382
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,583
[IZUMIKO] What was
all that about...?

383
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,750
The History Society is actually
the Mayura Souda Fan Club...?

384
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,875
why does the student council
have to remain neutral?

385
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,958
[IZUMIKO] And to top it all
off, Mayura and Takayanagi are

386
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,291
in some kind of
power struggle...?

387
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,208
I wonder how many of the other
students know what's going on.

388
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,958
[KISARAGI] ...from that point
on, we should be able to come up

389
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,708
with a solid plan...

390
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,166
And that will be
our schedule.

391
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,958
Now, let's enjoy some
free time before dinner.

392
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:35,833
[IZUMIKO] Oh, wow.

393
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,833
The meeting's already over...

394
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,625
Yes, okay...

395
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,708
I'd really appreciate it if
you could take care of that.

396
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,750
[IZUMIKO] I was wondering
where you ran off to.

397
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,000
[MAYURA] You found me!

398
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,166
[IZUMIKO] Well, um...

399
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,791
about what Kisiragi
was saying before...

400
00:17:00,875 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh, that again...?

401
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,375
Yeah, that wasn't pleasant.

402
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,791
She totally rained on my parade.

403
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:08,958
I'm confused, though...

404
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
What are you and
Takayanagi fighting over?

405
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,791
I mean...

406
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,375
what does he have
to do with anything?

407
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:16,916
I feel like a walk...

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,208
You should come too,
it'll be fun.

409
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,666
[MAYURA] As you know...

410
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,541
I don't like the
Onmyouji spells he uses...

411
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,958
I don't think we
could ever be friends.

412
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,541
[IZUMIKO] Does it have to
do with your ancestors...

413
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,375
since they were shrine
priests and came from

414
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:36,625
a Togakushi ninja village?

415
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,916
[MAYURA] Maybe a little...

416
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,833
but that isn't
the whole of it...

417
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,916
Kisaragi offered some
pretty sweet info

418
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,625
in her little lecture to me.

419
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,750
[IZUMIKO] I thought
you were offended

420
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,875
by how sharp Akinokawa was.

421
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,208
[MAYURA] Everything
she said was true.

422
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,791
[IZUMIKO] Even how
the History Society

423
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,875
is the Mayura Souda Fan Club?

424
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,500
[MAYURA] I know people have
been calling it that...

425
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,291
And I'm the one who
allowed it to continue.

426
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,875
But the most important thing I
got out of our exchange was that

427
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:06,291
the Student Council's Executive
Committee is undeniably neutral.

428
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,166
Really?

429
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,458
Really...

430
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,083
And that's
top-secret info...

431
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,041
even at a gossipy place
like Houjou Academy...

432
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,916
Nobody is supposed
to have any idea

433
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,375
who the judges are.

434
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,208
Top secret...

435
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,625
Hey, Izumiko...

436
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,625
She introduced you
to someone, right...?

437
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,833
Former Student Body
President Hodaka Murakami.

438
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,333
You know about that?!

439
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:31,291
I imagine Takayanagi
does, as well...

440
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,666
Even so...

441
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,708
I still don't know what
happened between you three.

442
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,041
I'm sorry I never
told you, but...

443
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,541
It's just...

444
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,041
I could never think of a good
way to bring it up, you know?

445
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,041
We were both keeping
secrets, so we're even.

446
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,458
It was really
nothing, though...

447
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,666
Not a big deal.

448
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,250
Kisaragi just invited me
to watch her practice.

449
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,500
I figured it was
something like that...

450
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,750
None of the judges are going
to make themselves obvious...

451
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,166
but still...

452
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,791
those who have the power
to see them, will see them.

453
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,083
Honestly...

454
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,208
I was expecting the
academy to be split in two

455
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:05,458
by the final round...

456
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:06,750
the festival...

457
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,750
but now I know that
there is a third area void

458
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,333
of outside influence...

459
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,041
That could change
things considerably.

460
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,458
[IZUMIKO] By "split in two"
do you mean a Mayura faction

461
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,916
and a Takayanagi faction?

462
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,708
[MAYURA] He's the
academy's favorite by far.

463
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,875
Do you know what
some people

464
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,000
actually believe...?

465
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,333
That Houjou Academy
was established

466
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,541
for the sole
purpose of

467
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,125
testing his
strength.

468
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,125
I seriously
doubt that.

469
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,708
They allowed
a shikigami to

470
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,416
become a student...

471
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,625
I hope I don't
sound jealous.

472
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:36,458
I'd never want to use
the spells that he does.

473
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,208
The reason you chose
to set yourself up

474
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,166
as Takayanagi's
opposition...

475
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,958
It's because of
Masumi, isn't it?

476
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,291
That's right...

477
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,500
it's for him...

478
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,500
Masumi...

479
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,583
and Manatsu too.

480
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,916
What would happen
if you were to win?

481
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,708
You don't even
know that...?

482
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,000
That's incredible...

483
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,583
Didn't they tell
you anything when

484
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,708
you enrolled?

485
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,250
[MAYURA] Well...

486
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,833
since we're here, why don't
we go to the rear shrine?

487
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,333
[IZUMIKO] Sure.

488
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,500
[MAYURA] If I win
the final round,

489
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,958
I'll become a World
Heritage Candidate.

490
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,833
[IZUMIKO] A World
Heritage Candidate?

491
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
I imagine the
rewards for that

492
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,041
would be substantial...

493
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,250
Both for me...

494
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,416
and for all the people
who are close to me.

495
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,166
So Sagara really
hasn't ever

496
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,458
discussed this
with you?

497
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,625
No I promise...!

498
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,125
That doesn't
necessarily mean

499
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,958
he doesn't know
about it, though.

500
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:31,375
That's Sagara...

501
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,416
He doesn't tell
anyone everything...

502
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,041
Not even me.

503
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,083
He's sure not an
easy guy to read...

504
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,666
Not at all.

505
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,000
[phone vibrates]

506
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,916
[MAYURA] Apparently, Manatsu
and Sagara are pretty close by.

507
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,666
[IZUMIKO] Huh...?

508
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Really?

509
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:51,583
Yep...

510
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,708
That's handy...

511
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,166
Let's go and
find them.

512
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,666
Hold on...

513
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,291
Handy...

514
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:57,125
how?

515
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,458
I have a question...

516
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,916
How would you feel about
beating out Takayanagi...?

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,333
and surpassing the shiki user.

518
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,833
[MIYUKI] Do you mean,
like, grade-wise?

519
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,333
[MAYURA] Grades have
something to do with it.

520
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,958
[MIYUKI] He's
using his shikigami.

521
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,291
That's how he's holding
his place as top student.

522
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:12,541
[MAYURA] That's right...

523
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:15,083
And unless you can see
a way past his trick...

524
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,708
there's no changing that...

525
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,625
You can never hope
to beat his grades.

526
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,291
Yeah, well...

527
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,166
I don't really care about
being the top-ranked student.

528
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,375
[MAYURA] Then
why did you join

529
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:27,541
the Student Council's
Executive Committee?

530
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,500
And for that matter,
why did you invite us?

531
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,041
Don't you see...?

532
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,708
Because the Student
Council is neutral.

533
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,416
So it's not
just about you...

534
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,833
You want to make
everybody else neutral, too.

535
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,458
I don't get it,
why do we have partners

536
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,000
in the first place...?

537
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,625
And here's another question...

538
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,750
Aside from the four of us,
do any of the other students

539
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,041
have partners?

540
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,375
Personally...

541
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,666
I think Takayanagi and
his shikigami are getting

542
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,083
preferential treatment.

543
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,750
And I think it's
about time that stopped.

544
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,083
Basically...

545
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:59,250
there are those of us who
are allowed partners...

546
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:02,791
and we're capable of rivaling
him, at least to some degree.

547
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,333
So that's
where I stand.

548
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:09,708
Now it's time to learn
what you're about, Sagara...

549
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,041
It's simple enough, really.

550
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,041
Are you in or are you out?

551
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,333
[MIYUKI] Haven't you known
that for a while now...?

552
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:20,541
There's no way I could
stand against you...

553
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,250
not while I'm still
such a newbie at defense.

554
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,291
That's along
the lines of what

555
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,041
I've been thinking, too...

556
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:29,000
However, my father seems
to think otherwise...

557
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,958
He said there's
a lot to more to you.

558
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,166
And how would he know...?

559
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,583
He and I didn't go
into this crap...

560
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:37,500
Is this the real reason you
invited us to your house?

561
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,750
No, that wasn't why,
actually...

562
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:43,333
Though I doubt
you'll believe that now.

563
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:44,208
[MAYURA] You should know...

564
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,000
I want Izumiko on my side...

565
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,000
She has the power to see
shikigami for what they are.

566
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,416
[hurried footsteps]

567
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,458
So, you see...

568
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,083
before you ever
go up against him...

569
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:56,125
I want to make it clear
which one of us stands

570
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,416
above the other.

571
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,250
Honestly...

572
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,000
Get it through
your head.

573
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:00,250
I don't
serve her...

574
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,166
'Kay...?

575
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,458
I just want a
normal life...

576
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,875
You know,
like college,

577
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,208
maybe even
a normal job

578
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,541
someday!

579
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,875
Well, you do sound
pretty sincere...

580
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:10,458
that's too bad...

581
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,791
I'm sorry...

582
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:14,250
but I have to take my
father's word over yours.

583
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,375
I want to see
your power, Sagara...
