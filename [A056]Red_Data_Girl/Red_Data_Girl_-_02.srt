sleep in the same room

now that he's
staying at the shrine?

Of course not...!

[HARUNA] I'd have
too many rivals.

What if I went by myself
and she didn't show?

135

but will you please
come with me?

He said he wasn't coming.

144
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,625
He isn't really the
type of person who goes

Now that I think of it he's
kind of like you, I guess.

147
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,791
I didn't realize that.

00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,250
Ya want any?

149
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,625

You airsick?

151
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,750
It's behind me...

152
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,208
[AYUMI] Is there
something in the back?

153
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,666
It's nothing...

154
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
I'll be okay.

155
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,708
[HARUNA] You okay...?

156
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,833
You look pale.

157
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,083
[IZUMIKO] Haruna...

158
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,125
would you mind
getting my luggage?

159
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,458
[HARUNA] No problem, but
you don't look so good.

160
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,666
I'll see if I can
find you some medicine.

161
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,791
[MIYUKI] Hey.

162
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,250
Are you really sick
or are you just faking...?

163
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,083
We aren't due to meet up with
your mom for a while yet.

164
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll be okay.

165
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,333
Did you send her a text?

166
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,208
[MIYUKI] Yeah...

167
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:06,833
She already sent a response...

Here, look.

observatory...

you'll actually make it?

I think I'll be okay, really,

175
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,416
I just need to adjust
to them, that's all.

176
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,041
[MIYUKI] The crowds here
in the big, bad city

177
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,666

178
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,250
Is that what this is about?

179
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,291
Don't make it sound
like I'm being a baby...

180
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,000
There are so many
weird things here.

181
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,208
They scare me.

182
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:34,416
What "weird things"
are you talking about?

183
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,083
Bad things that
follow me wherever I go...

184
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,958
They look like smoky shadows...

185
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,666
Sinister black figures.

186
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,958
If those things
actually do exist,

187
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,250
You can ask Yukariko
how to deal with them.

188
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,166
[NAKAMURA] Okay...!

189
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,875
I'm giving you
some free time now.

190
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,541
Meet back here at four...

191
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:59,416
and don't leave the Metropolitan
Government Office Building...

192
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,291
Everyone got that?

193
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,791
[STUDENTS] Yes!

194
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,833
Hey, do you
feel up to

195
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,208
visiting the
observatory?

196
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,583
I think so.

197
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,416
That one goes to the
southern observatory.

198
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,416
I knew you were going
to screw this up.

199
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,250
She specifically
said the northern one.

200
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,541
Well, it's already
half past three.

201
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,083
So you're terrified
of strangers.

202
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,458
Is that what this is?

203
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,125
You think anyone you
don't know is a threat.

204
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,250
They're all out to get you.

205
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:56,041
I don't think
everybody is that way.

206
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,291
But...

207
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,583
I was telling the truth
about the black figures.

208
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,125
[phone vibrates]

209
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,916
It's no good...

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,708
It looks like she
can't make it, after all.

211
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,791
[IZUMIKO] She can't...?!

212
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,083
Why not?

213
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,250
[MIYUKI] "Leave the
observatory immediately...

214
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:11,833
They've already found you."...?

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,500
Who's found us?

216
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,458
[IZUMIKO]
The creatures I mentioned.

217
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,750
They might be
after Mother, as well.

218
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,833
[MIYUKI] Yeah, right!

219
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,041
Come on!

220
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
We need to get out of
here, like she said!

221
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,166
[phone vibrating]

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,083
She wants us to go
to her house...?!

223
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:34,708
No way!

224
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,458
I can't go there!

225
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
Okay, I pulled up
the address she gave us.

226
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,375
It's not too far from here.

227
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,250
Are you serious?

228
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:43,291
No, we can't!

229
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
You want to see
her, don't you...?

230
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,500
We've come this far.

231
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,375
[dings]

232
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,166
[FEMALE ANNOUNCER]
Attention, travelers...

233
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,083
The gates at the western
entrance are no longer

234
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,166
in service...

235
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,208
I repeat...

236
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,375
the gates at the
western entrance are

237
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,166
no longer in service.

238
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:22,208
[emergency bell]

239
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,291
[MALE ANNOUNCER]
Attention all travelers.

240
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,750
The emergency bell is
a notification that all

241
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,958
train services--

242
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,500
[MIYUKI] What the hell
is going on here...?

243
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,500
It's almost like someone is
trying to stop us from leaving!

244
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,375
They may have
found us already.

245
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,250
Who exactly is this
"they" you keep talking about?!

246
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,291
I wouldn't be so scared
if I knew the answer.

247
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,041
But I feel someone...

248
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,916
and he's getting closer!

249
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,458
[MIYUKI] Let's get off...

250
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,166
We can't afford to wait here.

251
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:53,458
[footsteps, heavy breathing]

252
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,291
[MIYUKI] Come on, we need to
find a place that sells hats.

253
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,875
If we don't do something
about those braids,

254
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,666
you'll stand out wherever we go.

255
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,916
You may be right,
but even so...

256
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,083
[MIYUKI] Hurry!

257
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,083
[car door opening, closing]

258
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,250
[MIYUKI] Crap!

259
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,416
It looks like he dropped
us off at the wrong place.

260
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,791
[IZUMIKO] What?

261
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,166
[MIYUKI] We're just a couple
of blocks off, though.

262
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,541
We can probably walk
there in ten minutes.

263
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:52,416
[street light buzzes,
thunder rolls]

264
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,625
Talk about
bad timing.

265
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,250
It looks like it's
about to pour...

266
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,625
Let's hurry up.

267
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,333
[rain pours]

268
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,083
[thunder]

269
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,666
You've lived in the
mountains all your life,

270
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,125
and a little lightning
frightens you?

271
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:18,708
It's not
the lightning.

272
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,791
Then what, are you still scared
of whoever's looking for you?

273
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,166
[thunder]

274
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,875
That's a first.

275
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:32,958
I've never seen
someone who's

276
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,083
actually trembling
in fear before.

277
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,125
[IZUMIKO] He...

278
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,750
He's almost here.

279
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,458
[thunder]

280
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,875
[street lights buzzing]

281
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,166
At this point, even
I'm starting to think

282
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,666
that there might be
something out there...

283
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,125
Hey, I'll tell you what:
if you think it would

284
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,875
make you feel better, I could
chant a mantra for you.

285
00:14:57,958 --> 00:14:59,291
A mantra?

286
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,458
[MIYUKI] I was thinking
the "evil be gone" one...

287
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,833
I studied them
a bit at Mt. Haguro.

288
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,083
[IZUMIKO] I doubt that will
chase whoever this is away...

289
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,208
But...

290
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:09,833
if you don't mind...

291
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,208
Can-

292
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,375
Can I please
hold your hand?

293
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,208
[MIYUKI] Huh?

294
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,500
[IZUMIKO] Earlier...

295
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,166
that made me feel
not quite as afraid.

296
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:31,333
[thunder]

297
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,000
[MIYUKI] She's so cold...

298
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,291
Here he comes...

299
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,791
It's time.

300
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,333
[MALE VOICE] Protect
this land from harm.

301
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,833
Bring it peace and safety.

302
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:59,000
Fish in the sea, grass on
the ground, birds in the sky:

303
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,666
may the heavens
protect them all.

304
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,333
Shelter them and
strengthen them;

305
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,208
comfort them and care for them.

306
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,916
Hold them and keep them always.

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,208
Be they weak or strong, wise or
foolish: guard the souls of men.

308
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,041
Shelter them and
strengthen them;

309
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,625
comfort them and
care for them...

310
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,500
[MIYUKI] Shield us from
the evil that walks abroad,

311
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,416
give us light in the darkness
that our steps may not falter...

312
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,416
Hide us from that
which would destroy...

313
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,708
Protect us from that which
would harm, lend us strength

314
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,041
and determination as our
feet tread your path...

315
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,375
Shield us from the evil that
walks abroad, give us light

316
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,791
in the darkness that
our steps may not falter...

317
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,541
Hide us from that
which would destroy.

318
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,250
Protect us from that
which would harm.

319
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,708
Lend us strength
and determination

320
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,791
as our feet tread your path.

321
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:41,666
[thunder]

322
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,291
[YUKIMASA] What do
you think you're doing,

323
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,208
directing that mantra at me...?

324
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,250
Izumiko here is the one
who's in need of an exorcism.

325
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,708
Sagara, it's you!

326
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,791
But what are
you doing he--

327
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:54,208
[MIYUKI] Hold on...!

328
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,791
Stay right there...!

329
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,208
Not one step further until you
prove you're the real Yukimasa.

330
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:00,333
You're starting to make
a fool of yourself...

331
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,625
Just look...

332
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,708
Izumiko clearly recognizes
I am who I say I am.

333
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,083
But just a
second ago you

334
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,125
were terrified
of him!

335
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,750
You wanna explain
that to me?

336
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:09,875
Yeah, I know...

337
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,583
I was scared, but this
really is Sagara...

338
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,333
I guess I was imagining
things, like you said.

339
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,541
The whole time
I was frightened

340
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:17,500
for no good reason.

341
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,083
Don't give me
that crap!

342
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:21,500
[YUKIMASA] Actually, the fact
she was afraid of me is proof

343
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,500
that I am who I claim to be.

344
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,708
I really, truly
felt something...

345
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:27,708
I don't know what,
exactly, but...

346
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,500
I could sense something
bad approaching.

347
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,291
[YUKIMASA] I don't
doubt that you did...

348
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,416
You probably sensed someone
other than just me.

349
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,541
There is any number of people
in the world who would like

350
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,375
to make you theirs.

351
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,833
[MIYUKI] Okay...

352
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,916
but we kept being blocked
from getting to Yukariko...

353
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,625
Were you the one behind that?

354
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:47,041
No, none of that
was my doing...

355
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,166
Just so you know, you won't
see her even if you do

356
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,375
go to her house.

357
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,208
She gave up on your
meeting when she was unable

358
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:56,291
to reach the
northern observatory.

359
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,458
Even so...

360
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,083
the house has a
barrier around it,

361
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,791
which makes it an
ideal place to rest.

362
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,083
[IZUMIKO sneezes]

363
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,625
[IZUMIKO] Mother
really isn't here...

364
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,875
Is she?

365
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,708
[YUKIMASA] You mustn't
hold it against her...

366
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,541
She thought it would be best if
she acted as a decoy to draw

367
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,791
their attention away from you.

368
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,625
I guess I should
be used to it by now.

369
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,958
Mother's job in public security
always keeps her busy.

370
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,000
Taking that job
was wise on her part...

371
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,125
Though Yukariko's aptitude
is also some of what

372
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,708
keeps her busy...

373
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,333
Now, Izumiko, go upstairs and
look for a change of clothes...

374
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,416
And feel free to rest
for a little bit...

375
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,625
You look like you're about
to fall asleep standing up.

376
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,750
[YUKIMASA] Don't go
taking your pants off.

377
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,250
Keep in mind, this is
somebody else's home.

378
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,666
Where would I be
without you here

379
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,583
to point out the obvious?

380
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,166
[YUKIMASA] You're always
so angry when I see you.

381
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,500
Have you ever thought
we might try to have

382
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:03,416
a polite conversation
when we're alone?

383
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,958
[MIYUKI] It just pisses me off
how you're always so damn smug.

384
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,625
You might've fooled Suzuhara
but you can't fool me...

385
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,250
I know what
you're really like...

386
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,583
And don't forget it.

387
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,208
What are you
talking about now?

388
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,833
[MIYUKI] I saw it
with my own eyes:

389
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
Suzuhara was literally
shaking with fear...

390
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,333
She went back to normal
the second you showed up,

391
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,125
but only because of a spell...

392
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,375
I know what you did:
you exorcised her!

393
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,583
[YUKIMASA] So what?

394
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,250
I bet you're the reason
Yukariko decided not

395
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,291
to show up today.

396
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,166
I bet she could
sense your presence!

397
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,041
Yes, well, that
was inevitable...

398
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,750
You may not know
this yet, but it's

399
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,416
in their nature to run.

400
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
Like I told Izumiko earlier,

401
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,083
there is an endless list
of people who want to use

402
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:42,750
her powers for their
own personal gain.

403
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,625
Businessmen...

404
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,875
politicians...

405
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:45,708
academics...

406
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,250
men of religion...

407
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,750
even us Mountain Monks.

408
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,375
What type of power
does she have that would

409
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,250
attract so much interest?

410
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,750
[YUKIMASA] Don't you see...?

411
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:55,916
All that interest is
proof of its rarity...

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,416
Fewer and fewer people are
born with the pure power

413
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,791
that Mountain Monks train
all their lives to obtain.

414
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,083
This power has been given only
to women since ancient times.

415
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,916
A power given only to women?

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,291
I don't get it...

417
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,541
She certainly doesn't
seem all that impressive...

418
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:15,041
She's just a big scaredy cat who
can't do anything on her own.

419
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,166
[YUKIMASA] True...

420
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,958
I can't say that
she's fully awoken yet.

421
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,666
I'm sick of
this crap...

422
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,916
If you really want to
protect Suzuhara so badly,

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
do it yourself.

424
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,083
There is no way
in hell I'm going to work

425
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,625
as your lackey...!

426
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,416
If I have to, I'll find a way
to see Yukariko myself and--

427
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,000
[MIYUKI] Suzuhara...?

428
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,625
You should have warned us
you were coming down.

429
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,166
Suzuhara...?

430
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,500
[YUKIMASA] Get away from her.

431
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,125
Now...!

432
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,583
You're not dressed to stand in
the presence of Her Highness...

433
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,583
Get back!

434
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,291
[HIME-GAMI] Oh...

435
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,125
Yukimasa...

436
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,750
You are here, too?

437
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,583
I apologize for
welcoming you in such

438
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,875
an unseemly manner...

439
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,166
I had not yet made
arrangements to receive you.

440
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,083
Please, forgive me.

441
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,750
[HIME-GAMI] All is well...

442
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,916
I am the one who arrived
without announcing my intent.

443
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,541
This is my first time
descending into Izumiko.

444
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,208
I have not yet
adjusted to this body...

445
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,875
It is rather unpleasant, as it
is still too young for me...

446
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,708
Despite that...

447
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,625
[HIME-GAMI] I have come...

448
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:40,791
because I sensed something
monumental taking wing.

449
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:43,916
[YUKIMASA] Highness.

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,041
Will you stay with
Izumiko henceforth?

451
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,166
[HIME-GAMI] Let us
not be hasty...

452
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,208
It is not as though
you have caught me yet...

453
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,708
Regardless...

454
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,250
I would advise you to take
good care of Izumiko's body...

455
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,916
You must look after it well.

456
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,916
This child will likely
serve as my last vessel.

457
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,875
It will come to a
close as soon as that?

458
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,583
[HIME-GAMI] It may...

459
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,166
I doubt I will go
beyond this generation.

460
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,416
Princess!

461
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:26,666
[IZUMIKO] What?!

462
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,666
W-w-why am I wearing this...?

463
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,166
I'm...

464
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,625
I...

465
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:31,125
Hush.

466
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,625
Calm down.

467
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,833
You don't have to
remember everything now...

468
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,833
It will come back to you
gradually over time.

469
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,000
Uh, I...

470
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,541
Have to go.

471
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:47,125
So you're telling me she's
from a line of women who

472
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,041
are susceptible to possession?

473
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,416
I thought
I was prepared.

474
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,083
I had already
assumed that Izumiko

475
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,458
was a very
special child...

476
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,416
but I never
considered this.

477
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,208
[MIYUKI] What are
you talking about?

478
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,583
You were right...

479
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,458
Just as you said, protecting
Izumiko will go far beyond

480
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,083
what you are capable of.

481
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,125
If that's the case, then--

482
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,333
I hereby rescind my order
for you to attend

483
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,500
the same school as Izumiko...

484
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,625
If you want to transfer,
feel free to choose any

485
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:12,666
school you like.

486
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,541
Wait, what...?!

487
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,333
Just like that?

488
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,666
What is going
on here?

489
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,250
Shouldn't you be
at least a little happier...?

490
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,000
This is what you wanted, right?

491
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:33,291
♪

492
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,000
[MIYUKI] There aren't any
students named Wamiya.

493
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,833
[IZUMIKO] That's impossible!
