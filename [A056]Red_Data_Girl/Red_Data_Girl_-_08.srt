[MAYURA] You're here!

00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:21,708
I don't understand
what's happening...

6
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,750
Why would Masumi
have taken him away?

7
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,083
I wish I knew...

00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,625
but I can't even
tell where Manatsu is.

00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,125
That can't be true...

10
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,041
Now calm down a
little and try again.

Sagara, Suzuhara, if I may...

16
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,625
I'd like to have a word.

[PROF. SOUDA] My daughter
likes to keep me informed...

18
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,000
She's told me that both of
you are able to see Masumi.

19
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,791
I hoped you could explain to
me what happened with him...

20
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,208
What did he do?

21
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,791
[MIYUKI] We don't know.

22
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,125
[PROF. SOUDA] Do you think you
would be able to summon him

23
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,333
like Mayura and Manatsu do?

24
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,666
I'm sorry...

25

seems to be unique...

26
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,625
I doubt that anybody
could replicate it...

27
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,083
It's not a spell...

28
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,833
it seems more like
an innate gift.

29
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,541
[PROF. SOUDA] In this
situation, I am blind.

30
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,666
I am not able to see Masumi.

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,791
It appears that a special
form of atavism has emerged

32
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,125
in my children...

33
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,500
No one from my generation

Their mother is
unsettled by all this.

She hates to hear
them speak of Masumi.

36
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,500
As if, by virtue of giving
birth to them, she can sense

37
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,958
something ominous in the name.

38
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,750
[KISARAGI] Well...

39
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,833
I'm going to turn
in for the night.

It was strange,
though...

47
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,416
Manatsu talked about how you
would live a long life...

48
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,250
like he didn't expect
that for himself.

I guess I shouldn't
be surprised...

50
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,250
but see, the thing is...

51
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,958
Manatsu has the same heart
problem that took Masumi

52
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,250
so suddenly.

53
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,875
There's nothing
that the doctors can do

to help him at this point...

55
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,916
I think that's why...

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,416
our mother doesn't
like to remember Masumi.

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,458
Manatsu is a lot closer
to Masumi than he is to me...

I've always known that.

Even so...

I never imagined that
this would happen...

61
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,458
I didn't know that Manatsu
would choose to leave me

62
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,958
and join Masumi instead.

63
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,291
[IZUMIKO] The problem is...

64
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,041
he's trying too hard to
do what's best for you...

65
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,708
and he's responding with his
heart instead of his head.

66
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:43,416
If he wants so badly
to do what's best for me...

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,583
then he should leave Masumi's
plane and come back here.

68
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,416
You know the whole reason
I want to be the top student

To help Manatsu

00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,166
That's what I really want...

What I've been working toward
for as long as I can remember.

73
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,625
But somehow, he can't
understand that.

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,958
[IZUMIKO] Do you have a second?

75
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,583
I need your advice
about something.

00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,000
Earlier...

77
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,416
you said nobody could replicate
what Mayura and Manatsu

78
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
do to call Masumi.

79
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:15,916
[MIYUKI] That's what I said.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,541
What of it?

81
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:19,416
[IZUMIKO] The Hime-gami.

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,583
[MIYUKI] Slow down...

83
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,416
Why are you
bringing her up now?

84
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,958
Maybe she could help us...

85
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:26,833
Don't you think she might
know how to summon Masumi?

86
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,166
[MIYUKI] How could you
even suggest that?

87
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,125
[IZUMIKO] I think
it's possible...

88
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:34,458
Obviously, I can't talk to
her or ask her about it...

89
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,916
I can't, but you can!

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,375
[MIYUKI] Stop right there!

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,666
This is completely crazy...!

92
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,166
What are you thinking?

93
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,791
I'm thinking about
what it will mean

94
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,125
if Manatsu ends up staying
on the other side.

95
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,708
You mean...

96
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,083
you're referring to the other
plane of existence Masumi made?

97
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,083
Yes...

98
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
Know what I thought before...?

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,958
That I had dragged you into a
world that you weren't meant

100
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,500
to be a part of...

101
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,791
that you otherwise would've
had nothing to do with.

102
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,250
But then I saw how easily you
associated with Masumi...

103
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,291
and I started to
wonder if I was right.

104
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,541
If I turn into
the Hime-gami...

105
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,916
will you do it...?

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,291
Will you talk to her?

107
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,208
[MIYUKI] Hold on...!

108
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Is that something you can do?

109
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,583
I won't know...

110
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:19,875
not until I try.

111
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,625
Don't be so
casual about it...!

112
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,458
The Hime-gami is dangerous...!

113
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,958
She's so dangerous that I can't
even imagine what will happen

114
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,416
if she does show up.

115
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,708
I'm scared, too...!

116
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,708
The Hime-gami frightens me...

117
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,083
Becoming her isn't
something that I want.

118
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,458
Not at all...!

119
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,333
But we have to try everything
we can think of...!

120
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,208
Otherwise we might
lose Manatsu for good.

121
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,625
And you're sure...?

122
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,291
Completely?

123
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,625
I am...

124
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,291
Mayura's more than my roommate.

125
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,166
She's become a true friend...

126
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,458
She really took me under her
wing and helped me fit in

127
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,833
at school and with
the Student Council...

128
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,083
and now...

129
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,125
I have a chance to show
her how grateful I am.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,750
Don't you see...?

131
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,166
This is the way I can repay her.

132
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,833
[MIYUKI] Okay are you ready?

133
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:32,958
It's still me.

134
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,750
We didn't switch.

135
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,500
So what, is there
something else we need to do

136
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,833
before we can summon her?

137
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,916
[IZUMIKO] Maybe I'm
standing in the wrong spot.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,666
[MIYUKI] She isn't a cell phone.

139
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,458
[IZUMIKO] Hey...!

140
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,041
I felt something just ...

141
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,458
now...

142
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,833
[IZUMIKO] Strange...

143
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,291
[MASUMI] Hi, Suzuhara...

144
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,541
Did you come back
to keep your promise?

145
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,208
[IZUMIKO] Is that you,
Masumi...?

146
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:09,333
Why in the world are
you wearing that outfit?

147
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,166
[MASUMI] After seeing
Kisaragi in hers,

148
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,083
I thought it might be fun.

149
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:14,041
You have Manatsu!

150
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,250
Where is he?

151
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,791
[MASUMI] Here, but further in.

152
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,666
What do you mean,
"further in"?

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,916
Togakushi has a bunch
of different layers in it,

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,083
you know.

155
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,416
Why are you trying
to break Mayura's heart?

156
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,666
It's not right...!

157
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,333
Now, send Manatsu
back where he belongs!

158
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,583
[MASUMI] I'm trying not
to break Mayura's heart.

159
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:34,708
Have you seen her...?

160
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,166
Do you know how sad
she is right now?

161
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,041
[MASUMI] If we part now,
her sorrow will be less...

162
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,458
It will pass...

163
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:44,166
But the longer Manatsu and
I wait to go, the heavier

164
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,333
a burden her grief will become.

165
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,625
Oh, really...?

166
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:50,583
Is that what Manatsu
thinks or what you think?

167
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,041
We're of a like mind in this.

168
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,875
Over time, I've come
to like being Masumi...

169
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,708
I don't want to vanish.

170
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,083
But I'm well aware that
Mayura wouldn't hesitate

171
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,916
to choose Manatsu over me.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,208
And in that case...

173
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,250
it makes sense for us
to become one before

174
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,458
she is forced to choose.

175
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,791
[IZUMIKO]
But Masumi...

176
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,958
are you going
to vanish?

177
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,583
[MASUMI] As long as I remain in
Togakushi, nothing will change.

178
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:16,708
Not for me...

179
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,333
but you humans are different...

180
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,958
You seem to change
far more quickly than

181
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,666
I would have expected.

182
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,916
[IZUMIKO] Let me
talk to Manatsu.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,708
I don't think you can...

184
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,208
He's inside a cave.

185
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,000
[IZUMIKO] Oh.

186
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,041
All right...

187
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,625
then you can take me
to the cave.

188
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,125
The night is awfully
deep around here...

189
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,125
Are you certain?

190
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,875
Of course I am...

191
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,666
It was night the last time
we met, remember?

192
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,375
[MASUMI] So, you're the type of
girl who finds her true strength

193
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,541
when she's in a
difficult situation.

194
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:48,625
Well, you know...

195
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,958
that's very attractive.

196
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,625
Which reminds me,
remember how I asked you out?

197
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,625
[IZUMIKO] Yes, I remember.

198
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,041
But right now,
Manatsu comes first.

199
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,958
All right, all right...

200
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,625
Well, come on, then.

201
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,208
Tell me something...

202
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,000
If, between you and Manatsu,
only one of you could make it

203
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,166
back from here...

204
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,750
Who would you choose?

205
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,375
I wouldn't choose
either of us...

206
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,541
What right would I have
to make that call...?

207
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,916
We both have people
waiting for us.

208
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,250
Here we are.

209
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,791
This is the cave.

210
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,208
You'll have to find
a way to open it, though.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,125
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu...!

212
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,833
its me if you're in
there please come out!

213
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,666
I want to talk to you.

214
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,250
What's this boulder
doing blocking the entrance...?

215
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:11,750
How could he possibly have
gotten past something this big?

216
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,166
"Spirited behind a boulder"...

217
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,958
These things happen sometimes.

218
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,458
However, it would not have
happened if Manatsu hadn't

219
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,625
been perfectly willing.

220
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,833
He went into that
cave of his own free will.

221
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,208
[IZUMIKO] Right.

222
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,916
Okay.

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,750
[KISARAGI] Just as in the myth
of Ame no Uzume no Mikoto...

224
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,791
the tale that tells of this
mountain's beginnings...

225
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,583
dance has the power to purify.

226
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:40,666
[IZUMIKO] I don't know
what else to try...

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,000
Dancing may be the answer.

228
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,250
[IZUMIKO] Please, Masumi...

229
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,500
Do you have a fan I can have?

230
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
[MASUMI] I had a feeling
you'd be asking for one.

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:06,958
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu. You shouldn't
become part of this world.

232
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,541
Listen to me...

233
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:11,791
Nothing would make us happier
than if you were to come back.

234
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,625
Come out of there...

235
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,208
Please!

236
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:32,875
[singing in Japanese]

237
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:44,208
[singing in Japanese]

238
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,625
[IZUMIKO] Manatsu...

239
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,500
Mayura, your parents,
everyone...

240
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,791
we're all worried about you!

241
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,250
[MANATSU] Don't open the cave!

242
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,166
Masumi is on
the other side...!

243
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,041
It has to stay closed!

244
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:12,875
Hold on...!

245
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,625
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,250
But I thought I was with Masumi.

247
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,291
Wasn't he the one out here?

248
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,458
[MANATSU] You see...

249
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,625
I thought we could be one...

250
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,041
We can't...

251
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,000
I should never have considered
it in the first place...

252
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,250
Never...

253
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,916
He wants to break the
boulder and come out.

254
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,166
But wait...

255
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,833
hasn't he already come
to the outside world?

256
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:38,166
[MANATSU] Masumi is only a
small part of a greater being.

257
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,000
If his entire body makes it out,
he won't be Masumi anymore.

258
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,791
Thank you
so much, Suzuhara...

259
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,750
for coming after me.

260
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,083
Who is...?

261
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,583
Mayura's here.

262
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
[MAYURA cries]

263
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,500
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,125
[MAYURA] I'm still going to hit
you and scream at you later.

265
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,208
But for now...

266
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,708
it's just so good to see you.

267
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,791
[MANATSU] How did
you get here...?

268
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,000
when you didn't have
Masumi with you.

269
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,041
[MAYURA] I didn't need him.

270
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,125
Sagara brought me.

271
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:19,166
[IZUMIKO] Huh?!

272
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,708
What do you mean
Sagara brought you?

273
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,041
How could he have done that?

274
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,708
We can save the
explanations for later.

275
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,250
Look behind you!

276
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,958
[IZUMIKO] What is that?

277
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,708
[MIYUKI] Hey, snap out of it...

278
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,458
Do you know how to close
the cave's entrance?

279
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,875
[IZUMIKO] No idea...

280
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,916
All I know is that I was
trying to open it by dancing.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,333
[MIYUKI] How about you two?

282
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:01,625
We don't know either...

283
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,208
We can only summon him.

284
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,291
[MIYUKI] You have got
to be kidding me...

285
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,291
What the hell are
we gonna do now?

286
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,958
[MIYUKI] Just run for it!

287
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,333
[MANATSU] The real Masumi is on
the other side of that boulder!

288
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,625
We're in real trouble...

289
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,250
Once he's out he could
easily devour us.

290
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,375
[IZUMIKO] You have a staff?

291
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
[IZUMIKO gasps]

292
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,208
Keep running...!

293
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,000
We'll catch up later!

294
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:00,916
[IZUMIKO] Oh, no!

295
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,333
[MIYUKI] Monsters
and villains...

296
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:15,208
Goblins and devils, Dragons
and poisonous beasts...

297
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,125
poisonous insects...

298
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,958
Hear the sound
of my staff...!

299
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,791
Offer me no harm!

300
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:24,916
Sagara...

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,125
you sprouted wings...

302
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,791
How is that even possible?

303
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
[MIYUKI] It isn't.

304
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:30,791
But I can see
them right there.

305
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,208
Well, they aren't real.

306
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,916
Won't you at least try
to explain what you're doing?

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,208
Protecting you...

308
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,375
That's the best
I can hope to do.

309
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,291
There's no way I can force
that thing back into the cave.

310
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,541
[HIME-GAMI] So it would seem.

311
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,916
This task is too great for you.

312
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,833
It isn't me!

313
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,416
[HIME-GAMI] Hand me the
staff that you carry.

314
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,000
[HIME-GAMI] You have
suffered long, local deity,

315
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,375
for none have been
able to summon you.

316
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
It is not yet time
for your awakening.

317
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:15,625
But your day will come...

318
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,958
And on that day,
Great Nine-Headed Dragon,

319
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,958
you will be released
from all that binds you.

320
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,625
For now, return
to your slumber.

321
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,083
[HIME-GAMI] This is right.

322
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,875
The Great Nine-Headed
Dragon left one head before

323
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:54,333
returning to the cave.

324
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,750
You may continue to refer to
the dream seen by that head

325
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:01,625
as "Masumi." Assuming you are
still able to summon him,

326
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,166
that is.

327
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,958
[IZUMIKO] Lady Hime-gami!

328
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,458
Please ...

329
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,375
If it's possible...

330
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,625
can we...

331
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:18,125
remain separate
from each other?

332
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,833
Instead of turning
into you like before...

333
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,125
can I remain myself?

334
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,791
Can I see you
and not become you?

335
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,625
[HIME-GAMI] To ask
a question like that...

336
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,291
You still understand nothing.

337
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,541
Ask that of your mother.

338
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:34,875
I can't...

339
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,000
I never see my mother!

340
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,333
It is you...!

341
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,583
But Mom, what are
you doing here?

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,750
Is that really her?

343
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,750
[YUKARIKO] That wasn't
so bright, you two...

344
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,666
What in the world were you
thinking, meddling with

345
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,208
a powerful being like that?

346
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,708
What the Hime-gami
said while we

347
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:04,916
were on the other side...

348
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,166
Was she trying to say
that she's with you now?

349
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,625
[YUKARIKO] That's
right, you got it...

350
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,666
and that's the reason that
you and I aren't supposed

351
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,291
to see each other
all that frequently...

352
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,166
For now...

353
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
I carry the Hime-gami...

354
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:19,500
but I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to contain her.

355
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,291
[IZUMIKO] Were you okay with
it when you started turning

356
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,583
into the Hime-gami?

357
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:24,708
Did you accept it
just like that?

358
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,125
Am I being selfish?

359
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,500
Is it wrong of me to want
to be like everyone else?

360
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:30,833
No, not at all...

361
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,875
Honestly, it'd be strange
if you weren't at least

362
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,625
a little hesitant.

363
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,666
[YUKARIKO] I'm afraid
neither of you realize just

364
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,291
how unstable you truly are.

365
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,583
You must change...

366
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,583
How to do so is the
question that faces you...

367
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,916
It is a deadly question
that everybody who has

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,458
spiritual powers
must confront.

369
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:51,375
I intervened to settle
things for you this time...

370
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,125
So fortunately, your real
trial has been put off

371
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,708
for a little longer.

372
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,083
How can I face it...?

373
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:59,583
I don't think I'm
strong enough, Mom.

374
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,833
[YUKARIKO] That's right...

375
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,541
But I'm strong enough
for both of us, Izumiko.

376
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:07,708
So for as long as I am able
to do so, I'll protect you.

377
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,916
But that isn't
going to last forever.

378
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,583
It was good to
see you two...

379
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,041
Stay here and wait
for your friends.

380
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,625
They'll be along.

381
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:23,500
Wow, Yukariko is really
something else, isn't she?

382
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:24,875
Yeah, she is...

383
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,875
It's kinda difficult for me
to think of her as my mom

384
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,125
sometimes.

385
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,666
[MIYUKI] She sure is pretty.

386
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,083
Hey, you know something...?

387
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,583
I think you should try to
start making your thoughts

388
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,791
and feelings clearer.

389
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,958
It's like everything
always comes

390
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,250
out of the blue with you.

391
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,583
You're the one who
doesn't tell anyone anything...!

392
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,875
I have no idea what you're
thinking half the time!

393
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,666
You bottle up your feelings and
hoard secrets like they're gold!

394
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,583
Well, that's because--

395
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:48,416
[MANATSU] There they are...!

396
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,875
Shinkou...!

397
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,083
Suzuhara!

398
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,041
We were so worried,
but you made it back!

399
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,583
[MAYURA] Are you okay?

400
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,750
[IZUMIKO] I'm fine.

401
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,458
I not hurt or anything.

402
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,208
All of a sudden
we were at the shrine...

403
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,375
Standing right in front of
the komainu shrine guardians.

404
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:03,958
Man, I'm starving...!

405
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:07,000
I haven't had anything
to eat in two whole days.

406
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,875
There's a noodle
stand by the shrine gates

407
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,375
if you can make it that far.

408
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,458
[MANATSU] I dunno...

409
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:12,958
you might have to carry me.

410
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,333
[EVERYONE laughs]

411
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,666
[MAYURA] I'll never forget
what you did for Manatsu.

412
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,500
Not for as long as I live.

413
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:34,833
♪

414
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,208
[IZUMIKO] Miyuki and I returned
home to Tamakura Shrine

415
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:06,541
to spend the second half
of the summer vacation.

416
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,041
I don't know why...

417
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,416
but out of the blue, Miyuki
asked me to perform a dance

418
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,083
to summon Wamiya.

419
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,750
[MIYUKI] I figured
it wouldn't work.

420
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:16,250
[IZUMIKO] You did?

421
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,833
Why?

422
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:19,916
[MIYUKI] Because you were acting
all buddy-buddy with Masumi...

423
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,541
so Wamiya's sulking now.

424
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,375
Huh...?

425
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:23,875
But how could you know that?

426
00:23:23,958 --> 00:23:25,375
For a while I really
thought we'd seen

427
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:26,791
the last of Wamiya...

428
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,958
but then...

429
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:31,083
one day a talking crow
flew into my dorm.

430
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:34,625
He said he lacked the power to
take on human form in Tokyo...

431
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,250
I recognized the voice.

432
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,375
Is that why you
ended up outside the room

433
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,541
when Kisaragi
performed at the inn...?

434
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,083
And why it looked like you
had black wings after we fled

435
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:45,416
from the cave?

436
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,541
[MIYUKI] He told me if
we wanted to follow you...

437
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,166
he and I would have
to combine our powers.

438
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,083
I was wondering...

439
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,833
when Souda said you had entered
the school as my partner...

440
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,958
how did you feel?

441
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,541
I mean, do you...

442
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,166
think of me that way?

443
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,375
Well, to be honest
with you, it's hard to say...

444
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,958
In some ways I think
of you as a partner,

445
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,208
but in some ways I don't.

446
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,791
I mean...

447
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:13,666
it's difficult when I get the
feeling that you stay with me

448
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,333
in spite of what
you really want.

449
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,625
[MIYUKI] Even I wasn't certain
what I really wanted...

450
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,041
I was torn.

451
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,333
That thing with
Souda and Takayanagi...

452
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,583
I don't know...

453
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,333
It made me think I'd be
better off just going to

454
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:27,125
a normal school...

455
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,833
but then the crow
showed up...

456
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,041
and I began to
question that, too.

457
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,416
May I ask you
something...?

458
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,208
Do you find it at all strange
that Wamiya and Takayanagi

459
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:39,916
look so much alike?

460
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,583
Huh...?

461
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,041
Why do you ask?

462
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,041
[MIYUKI] It just bothers me
that Wamiya looks so much

463
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,416
like that pompous jerk.

464
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,750
[IZUMIKO] I still don't
see why it's a big deal.

465
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,375
[MIYUKI] To be blunt...

466
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,208
That's the kind of guy
you're attracted to.

467
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,125
Guys who look like
the two of them.

468
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,083
[IZUMIKO] What?!

469
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,125
[IZUMIKO] Just so I know,
when you say "you"...

470
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,666
do you mean me...

471
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,041
or do you mean...
