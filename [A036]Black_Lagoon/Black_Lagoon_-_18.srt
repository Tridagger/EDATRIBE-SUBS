1
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,041
[JANE] What do we do now?

2
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,500
It's not like we
can go any higher.

3
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,291
Do you at least have a plan?

4
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:09,583
[ROCK] I'm thinking about it.

5
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:11,250
[JANE] Just great.

6
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,875
[ROCK] Ow!

7
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,125
[SHEN HUA] This where
real fight begin!

8
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,916
[REVY] She's headed your way!

9
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,583
--You get her?
--I dunno.

10
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,666
--Watch yourself.
--[EDA] Yeah.

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:41,125
[SHEN HUA] Got you good!
Yes, I did!

12
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:44,375
[EDA grunting]

13
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:47,333
[SHEN HUA] Oh, I thinking
for sure I take your head off.

14
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,625
But from sound of voice, look
like I catch nun instead, yes.

15
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay, Sawyer!

16
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,375
Damn it!

17
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,958
Shit!

18
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,000
Revy, the knife-wielder's
just a diversion.

19
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,333
She's the one to watch.
Go after her.

20
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,916
Good point.
Besides, helping you

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,083
isn't gonna earn
me a damn penny.

22
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,041
--See ya.
--[EDA] Shit.

23
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,083
--[REVY] Don't die.
--[EDA] Yeah.

24
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:19,125
Feint operation a success,
miss hostage nun.

25
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,708
Hey, you listen up, okay, slut?!

26
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,125
You throw away your gun
and you come out now!

27
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,791
I think you going to Hell
if you let nun die here!

28
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,333
Not good thing!

29
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:32,166
Revy! Don't worry about me!
I'll be fine! Just shoot her!

30
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,750
Hm. You good actor, nun.

31
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,083
But we both know
slut not inside.

32
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,333
--Now...
--Hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

33
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,416
Don't you wanna hear
what I have to say first?

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,666
Seriously, it could
make you a lot of money.

35
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,541
[SHEN HUA] So sorry,
I not stupid.

36
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,416
I not letting you buy more time.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,750
You can't kill me.

38
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,541
Like you said, you'll go
to Hell for killing a nun.

39
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:52,083
[SHEN HUA] Oh, but I atheist.

40
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,500
Your religion have
nothing to do with me.

41
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:57,083
--Time to say goodbye, nun!
--[EDA] Dumb bitch.

42
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,666
You're going to Hell a little
earlier than expected.

43
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,875
Take a look!

44
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,708
[smashing sounds]

45
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,125
[JANE] She's here! Oh my god,
she's gonna kill us!

46
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,125
Quick, do something!

47
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,458
Wait! Just wait.

48
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,000
This is no time to panic.

49
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,666
"No time to panic"?!
What, are you blind?

50
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,291
Look, if you've got any
better ideas, I'm all ears.

51
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,041
But hoping she'll just
fall through? That's stupid!

52
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,458
[ROCK] It is not stupid!

53
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,750
The roof from where she is
to where we are is rotten.

54
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,250
All it'll take
is one little step.

55
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,041
Now I've... got... you.

56
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,333
[DUTCH] We're almost in port.
Should see them any minute.

57
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,541
Alright. See anything yet?

58
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,541
[DUTCH] All I can see right now

59
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,708
is the Buddha and
the city lights.

60
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,000
Hold on a sec... Is that...?!

61
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,625
Aw, shit! That's
just fuckin' perfect!

62
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:51,875
What's wrong, Dutch?

63
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,500
They finally drop
an A-bomb on Roanapur?

64
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,375
I wish. That'd be a whole
lot better than this.

65
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,083
If that were it,
at least I wouldn't be

66
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,833
the only one getting
fucked. Look at this shit!

67
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,916
Some goddamn idiot's started
a bonfire on my dock!

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,541
Motherfucker!

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,250
[groaning]

70
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,291
It hurts, goddamn it!

71
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,875
Eda, you stupid cow! Why the
hell'd you tip her off?!

72
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,916
[EDA] My bad.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
[REVY] I'm skewered,
for fuck's sake!

74
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,916
--[EDA] Sorry.
--[REVY] Useless whore.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,250
[EDA] If I hadn't
distracted her,

76
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,333
I wouldn't have been
able to shoot her.

77
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,375
But forget that.
What's happening upstairs?

78
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,625
[REVY] The ladder's no good.

79
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,083
That spooky chick cut it
down with her chainsaw.

80
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,958
Fuck, this hurts!

81
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,250
What in god's name
is goin' on here?!

82
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,791
No one asked you to turn
this place into Burning Man!

83
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,708
I mean, Jesus! Y'all had
one simple job to do!

84
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:52,458
All you had to do was
catch one little girl!

85
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,916
Those folks are
all up on the roof.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,333
Huh?

87
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,916
But the fire's so darn fierce,
I can't get up there.

88
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,666
[ROCK] That's it.
Come on. Right this way.

89
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,291
Come here and get us.

90
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,500
[JANE] Is it just me, or is
she in a really good mood?

91
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:17,750
Usually, I just dismember...
and the job's over.

92
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:24,291
That's why... jobs like this
are nice... once in a while.

93
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,583
I won't...

94
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,416
--...kill you... today. 
--[JANE] Do something!

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,625
She's started babbling now!
This can't be a good sign!

96
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:36,000
But if you don't mind, I might
help myself... to a couple...

97
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,833
...of your hands and feet.

98
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,125
I'm just a cleaner.

99
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,833
Always cleaning up
after other people.

100
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,458
But today... is different.

101
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,250
Today, I'm climbing
up the ladder...

102
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,458
...to a whole new position.

103
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,041
I think we better get started.

104
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,333
This is your cue.

105
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,375
To do what?

106
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,875
[SAWYER] You'll be fine.

107
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,041
I had my throat slit,
but I lived through it

108
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,041
and just look at me now.

109
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,750
[explosion]

110
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,250
What was that?!

111
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,833
Damn! The fire must've reached
the high-octane gasoline!

112
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,750
[JANE] Oh, god!
She's still smiling!

113
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,250
It's over! Now she's gonna
start talking all creepy again

114
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,541
and then she's gonna cut me
up into little pieces!

115
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,833
You have to do something!

116
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,500
[ROCK] What do you suggest?

117
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,458
Now what?

118
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,000
I dunno.

119
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,875
[JANE] What's going on?

120
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,375
Explain this!

121
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,625
How should I know?! I don't
know what's going on either!

122
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,166
[JANE] Oh, no!

123
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,583
Rock, are you alright?

124
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,125
Where's spooky chick?

125
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,791
Ah... Well, she's... here.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,125
Someone wanna
explain this to me?

127
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,875
What the hell did you do?

128
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,916
Uh, nothing I can think of.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,833
It was weird. She got
like this all of a sudden...

130
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,625
...after dropping
her voice machine.

131
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,625
[EDA] One of those, huh? She's
probably got emotional issues.

132
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,750
I've run into these types
before. Very unpredictable.

133
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,833
[ROCK] What do we do with her?

134
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,416
[REVY] Hey, Spooky.

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,166
This is what happens when you
try to be something you're not.

136
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
Revy, you're bleeding.

137
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,500
Oh, this thing? It's not
as deep as it looks.

138
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,833
Hey! Did you guys see that?!

139
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm pretty sure this
building's about to collapse.

140
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,791
[REVY] Huh?

141
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,916
The dock's breaking
up in the fire!

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,666
Can you see Revy and the others?

143
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,125
I can't see much.
But once we make our move,

144
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,833
Revy's gonna fall right
into sync with us. No worries.

145
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,291
Benny! Keep it full throttle
and pull a 180 at the pier!

146
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,958
[BENNY] Alright! I'm pretty
sure I can handle that.

147
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:54,000
[rumbling]

148
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,541
Oh, no!

149
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,708
Help me!

150
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:05,208
[LOTTON] I am here
to take your life!

151
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,958
And who, you ask, is the specter
that stands before you?

152
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,500
My name is Wizard!

153
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,750
Lotton the Wizard!

154
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,416
And while I have no
grudge against you...

155
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,791
Damn. The whole
thing's destroyed.

156
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,791
[coughing]

157
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:41,333
[REVY] Damn it.

158
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,333
--The boat!
--[EDA] 'Bout fucking time.

159
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,541
[REVY] Good. They're
headed straight for us.

160
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,208
Get to the pier!

161
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,458
There they are!
After 'em! Move it!

162
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,750
Stop!

163
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,125
--Touchdown, Dutch!
--Hit it now, Benny!

164
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,750
--[BENNY] You got it!
--[RUSSELL] Get back here!

165
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,291
Damn it! A few of these pricks
made it on to my boat!

166
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,500
[REVY] Rock!
Get the girl inside!

167
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,625
Over here! Hurry up!

168
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,125
[SHEN HUA] Oh, you alive, too.

169
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,458
[coughing]

170
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,000
You very lucky, yes.

171
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,083
Were you watching?

172
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:47,708
[SHEN HUA] Yeah. Well, mostly.

173
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,375
How'd I look?

174
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,500
I think you look very
much like king of idiots.

175
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:57,458
In future, I suggest you stop
making big entrance like that.

176
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,416
[LOTTON] Are you alright?

177
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,500
Do I look like I in shape
to do Lion Dance?

178
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,708
Well, for next time, you should
wear a bulletproof vest.

179
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,875
It's reassuring to have,
just in case.

180
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:18,250
Only real weapon
is one of offense.

181
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:24,625
Either way, there won't be next
time. Not with wound I have.

182
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,333
[LOTTON] I'll take you to
a doctor. Give me your hand.

183
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,500
I can't allow you
to die here alone.

184
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,291
Please come with me.

185
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,666
[SHEN HUA] You not... cut out
for killing in city like this.

186
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,000
I-I think maybe you make
perfect host at bordello, yes.

187
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,375
[LOTTON] Thank you, but I think
I'm much too clumsy for that.

188
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,916
If she's alive...

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,208
...we should take her, as well.

190
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,166
[SHEN HUA] She lucky, too.

191
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,000
Lobos! Get your ass in here,
you piece of shit!

192
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,000
[LOBOS] Yeah, Boss?

193
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,833
What's taking
Russell so long?!

194
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,958
I tried to tell you, things are
not gonna be that easy for him.

195
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,375
Fuck that!

196
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,500
I'll be eatin' the shit
sandwich when I hafta go home

197
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,416
and explain this
to Don Gerolamo!

198
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,916
I understand how you feel, but--

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,958
Shut up! If you're
looking to die

200
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,083
or you're just plain stupid,
keep talking.

201
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,458
Otherwise, call home
and get us some soldiers!

202
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,583
But that... That's just
crazy. You're gonna end up

203
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,875
starting a war with the
Russians and the Chinese.

204
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,791
I don't give a fuckin' shit!
Now get me to a goddamn phone!

205
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,083
I'll make the call!

206
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,708
Of course. Be right back.

207
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,000
There's a hatch here.
I'm going down.

208
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,333
You guys take care of
their gunmen, alright?

209
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:44,875
You betcha.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,416
Damn. I'm going back
to the controls.

211
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,333
We're shorthanded as it is!

212
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,125
I'll take 'em to the rodeo.

213
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,708
Even Tuff Hedeman would
be scared of this bull.

214
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,041
Well, it sounds like
fun to me, Dutch.

215
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,041
Let me know before
the show starts.

216
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,708
--Ow, my head...
--[ROCK] Are you alright?

217
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,375
Sorry for rushing you like that.

218
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,458
I wish you'd thought of that

219
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,333
before you pushed
me in head first.

220
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,375
[BENNY] So...

221
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:09,375
Dutch is back behind
the wheel again.

222
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,791
I take it this is our guest.

223
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,625
Welcome aboard the Lagoon.

224
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,708
Everyone here calls me Benny.

225
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:19,083
I'm Janet Bhai,
but call me Jane.

226
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,500
From what I hear,

227
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,041
we've got some uninvited guests
on board at the moment.

228
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,250
But you can relax in my room
until this all blows over.

229
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,166
We'll be lightening
our load soon.

230
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,750
Here you go. Oh, and please
don't touch any of the hardware

231
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,833
in this room, okay?
I'm serious. Not a thing.

232
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,041
[DUTCH] We're about to
start the rough stock.

233
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,375
--You ready?
--[REVY] Wait.

234
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,875
Eda. Hang on.

235
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:40,958
What's going on?

236
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,708
Alright, Dutch,
make this bull dance!

237
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,750
Having fun yet, Eda?!

238
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,083
[EDA] You could've warned me!

239
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,041
Die, you bitches!

240
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,625
I have a question--

241
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,166
is this how you guys
normally drive?

242
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,750
No, this isn't typical.

243
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,250
For a second, I thought
maybe you were hired

244
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,791
to kill me like this.

245
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,416
Fuck off! You think
this is exciting?!

246
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,750
Wait till I put one
between your eyes!

247
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,708
Pretty lame, Revy.
You outta bullets? Shit.

248
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,125
If I can take you out,

249
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,291
--I'll be a goddamn hero!
--[DUTCH] Revy. Try this.

250
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,416
[DUTCH] Well, did you
enjoy the bull ride?

251
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,708
[REVY] Loved it, Dutch.

252
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:33,791
You're kidding, right?
Never wanna do that again.

253
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,333
Revy?

254
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,583
[REVY] I'll take
the doughboy up here.

255
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,333
[DUTCH] Alright. But
we've got one more rat

256
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,208
that snuck into
the engine room.

257
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,541
Eda. That one's yours, alright.

258
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,208
Sure thing, partner.

259
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,000
[RUSSELL] What the hell
is this place?

260
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,833
Hey, Jane! Where are you?!

261
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,208
So, how long before we reach
the port we're headed to?

262
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,958
I'd say roughly eight hours.

263
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,916
Alright, that's good. That
should give me plenty of time.

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,458
Hey, Mr. Japanese, I need you to
go get my laptop out of my bag.

265
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:04,208
Huh? But I don't have your bag.

266
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,291
Don't have it? What do you mean?

267
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,625
Are you stupid or something?!

268
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:09,166
Why on earth didn't you
bring it with us?!

269
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,041
How is this my fault?!
If it was so important,

270
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,333
why didn't you
bring it yourself?!

271
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:14,041
You just don't get it, do you?!

272
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:14,958
What?!

273
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:16,708
Don't get rough,
okay, you two?

274
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,166
You'll damage the electronics.

275
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,166
I can't do anything
without my things!

276
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,500
If I don't have my laptop,

277
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:24,125
then I'm unable to access
the web and without...

278
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,666
Unless...

279
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:27,750
[RUSSELL] Jane!

280
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,541
Where are you?!
Come on out! Now!

281
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,166
Shit! Shit! Shit! There's
no way through the front door.

282
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,875
Well, fuck you!

283
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,375
I'll show you who's boss,
stupid engine!

284
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:41,000
When this is all over, I'm
gonna drink till I go blind!

285
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,208
Then I'm gonna run
all over Rawhide

286
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:47,791
and fuck expensive women
till my balls hurt!

287
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,458
[EDA] Wow, that sure does
sound like fun, cowboy.

288
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,291
You must be one of
those real Texan studs.

289
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,833
But before you do all that,
maybe you should give God a call

290
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
and ask him what it's like
to fuck expensive women

291
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,125
when your balls have been
blown to high Heaven.

292
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,666
Dutch. He's covering my field
of vision with his fire.

293
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,958
Ain't that a bitch.

294
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,208
I need another bull ride.
Think you can do it?

295
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,250
I've gotta admit, this guy's
pretty quick for a lard-ass.

296
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,791
I'll signal you once
I've lured him to his grave.

297
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,750
Sure. That's easily
done on my end,

298
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,375
but are you gonna survive it?

299
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,500
That all depends on
your timing, Dutch.

300
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,041
Alright!

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,583
Don't push me, you damned nun!

302
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:33,375
I'm sick and tired of
dealing with you people!

303
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,666
Well, tough shit,
you inbred son of a bitch.

304
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,125
If you don't like us, then
get the hell off this boat!

305
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,875
--No can do, Sister!
--[EDA] Shut up!

306
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,125
[BOTH] Those plates are
mine, shithead!

307
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,916
You don't actually have them?

308
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,916
The plates are lost
on the ocean of the web.

309
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,500
The work had already
been completed,

310
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,666
so all that was left to do was
collect the engineering data

311
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,250
from our team members around
the world and create them.

312
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,833
But now that our data admin is
dead, I can't access any of it.

313
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:04,083
The encryption is automatically
changed every day. I give up.

314
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,750
We've already been paid, so it
doesn't change anything for us,

315
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,250
--but...
--Yeah.

316
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,625
The problem's Eda.
As soon as she finds out

317
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,583
that you don't have the
plates, she'll find a way

318
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,000
to crucify you that would
impress Jesus Christ himself.

319
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,375
You're kidding, right?

320
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,750
Well, unfortunately,
Roanapur is the kind of place

321
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,708
where violent jokes
tend to come true.

322
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,791
Then can I use your
computer just for a while?!

323
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:26,791
No can do.

324
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,541
Why not?!
You are so selfish!

325
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,250
Sorry, but the answer's no.

326
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,000
The fact is my machines
are very sensitive

327
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,541
and they don't like
anyone using them but me.

328
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,833
Although, if I were
the one using it,

329
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,083
that'd be a completely
different story.

330
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,208
To be honest, I'm curious
to see what kind of tricks

331
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,250
your operator had up his sleeve.

332
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,833
Don't disappoint me. 'Cause if
this turns out to be something

333
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,916
that a junior high student
could've come up with, then...

334
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,250
...I'll hafta charge you
for wasting my time.

335
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,250
Shucks. I sure do
get a kick outta

336
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,083
playing chase with a young
lady like yourself,

337
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,166
but these old legs can't
keep this up much longer.

338
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,333
Why don't you give up?

339
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,416
I promise I'll just
toast you lightly.

340
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,083
I'll make it quick.

341
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,083
My wife didn't even take
five minutes to cook.

342
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,458
I'll be happy as I can be

343
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:17,666
once I get a whiff of your
skin starting to char.

344
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,333
And would you just look at this
weather we've been getting.

345
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,041
It's the perfect day
for a barbecue.

346
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,250
[REVY] Dutch! Now!

347
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,166
You're a rocket man, baby!

348
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,166
I knew it. You guys really are
trying to kill me, aren't you?

349
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,041
No, this isn't typical.

350
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,041
Yeah, sure. Well, at least
let me see the data

351
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,625
before I die, okay?

352
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:50,875
Well, it's not an IFSR
or an exchange code.

353
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,666
If I had to guess,
I'd say it's a GOST type.

354
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,791
We could always cause
a buffer overflow

355
00:18:55,875 --> 00:19:00,333
and take control quickly. But
using force isn't very elegant.

356
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,166
I don't give a shit
about elegance!

357
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,875
You can't rush this. You see,

358
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,750
I'm running six keys against
the GOST simultaneously.

359
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,291
If one of these
breaks the cipher,

360
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,791
we'll know in a few
minutes and all that data

361
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,958
will start downloading.
Simple as that.

362
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,791
[EDA] From the sounds of it, my
partner just took care of fatty.

363
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Now you're the only
one left, cowboy.

364
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,291
If you try to resist,
I'll blow your head off

365
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:24,250
and toss your corpse
in the ocean.

366
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:26,208
[RUSSELL] Okay, okay.

367
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,208
Well, I'll be damned. How am I
gonna explain this to the boss?

368
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,875
I don't think you'll
hafta worry about that.

369
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,041
Lobos will take care of him.

370
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,041
He understands how things
work here in Roanapur.

371
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,625
[RUSSELL] We talking
about the same guy?

372
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,916
The Lobos I know,
he don't stand a chance.

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,583
It'll be a cold day
in Hell when...

374
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:46,916
[EDA] What?

375
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,333
Hold up. I've seen you
somewhere before...

376
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,791
Florida? No, no...

377
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:57,333
Oh, yeah, it was in Dirty City.
Washington D.C., I'm sure of it!

378
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,625
Oh, yeah? Well I've never
seen you before in my life.

379
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,291
I was born in Alabama.

380
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,208
I've never even been to D.C.

381
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,333
Fine. Then I saw a woman
who looked exactly like you.

382
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,791
I didn't recognize you before

383
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,666
on account of them
glasses and that outfit.

384
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,458
Now when was that?

385
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,583
It had to be when Don Gerolamo
was in D.C., so...

386
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,166
It was him. That man!

387
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,750
[EDA] Hey. You better
stop there, cowboy.

388
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,625
You got the wrong
person, alright.

389
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,708
That's it! It's all
coming back to me now.

390
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,666
It was that damn senator,
Jack Bonham!

391
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,958
[BENNY] Tally ho!

392
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,333
It was a GOST code!
Your operator was skilled,

393
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
but in the end, he couldn't
match my Kung Fu.

394
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,208
I'm as great as Kevin Mitnick
and Kevin Poulsen combined!

395
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,916
What a rush! I feel amazing!

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,541
There you go. I got in,
so what's my reward?

397
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,083
I must get...

398
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,750
You're so cute.

399
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,291
And watching you break code
really turns me on.

400
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:04,500
[EDA] So, that woman... She was
wearing a navy blue suit, right?

401
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,166
She was having a dinner
meeting with the senator

402
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,000
and several other major
players in Washington...

403
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,333
...at a French restaurant
called the Fontainebleau.

404
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,583
[RUSSELL] That's right!
The Fontainebleau!

405
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,291
But wait... What were you
doing with a senator?

406
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,416
[EDA] At the time, she and
her superiors were there

407
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,791
to discuss NAFTA.
In particular,

408
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,500
there were concerns on the hill
over a number of member states

409
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:29,375
within the OAS who opposed
the signing of the agreement.

410
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,791
She was there to discuss
how best to deal with them.

411
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,750
--[RUSSELL] You wouldn't be...
--I'm afraid you're mistaken.

412
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,375
It's not me.

413
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,875
I'm just a goddamned nun
from the Ripoff Church.

414
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,458
But I'll tell you one thing,
and this is God's own truth--

415
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,625
I wasn't born in Alabama.

416
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:50,833
My hometown is actually
Langley... Virginia.

417
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:52,250
You're CIA!

418
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,583
[gunshot]

419
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,333
[REVY] Hey, sure took
you long enough.

420
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,458
[EDA] Yeah.

421
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,000
So, did you send
that cowboy to Hell?

422
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,791
We're almost in port.
Let's just take it easy.

423
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,333
[EDA] Why not?
God's still up in Heaven

424
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,041
and all is well with the world.

425
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,708
[ROCK] Uh, I won't be
gone too long, okay.

426
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,916
[REVY] After that,
I'm leaving... partner.
