1
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,750
Look, Lieutenant,
why do you think

2
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,666
we let that little bitch live?

3
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,833
I mean, c'mon!

4
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,916
Stop screwing around, man!

5
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,041
What? You think you're Paladin
from Have Gun Will Travel?

6
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,583
You just want that
poontang all to yourself?

7
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,708
Dontcha?

8
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:30,875
Hey, that's cool.

9
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,708
If you wait your turn,
maybe I'll letcha--

10
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:36,416
You're worse than a fucking
animal, you sick son of a bitch.

11
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,958
You're not gonna lay one
finger on her, you hear me?!

12
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,416
Bring it on.

13
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,708
If you've got the balls.

14
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,500
Hotel Quebec?

15
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,833
This is Sierra Niner.
Morales has just pulled up.

16
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,125
He's heading for
the hall.

17
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,291
Copy that.

18
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:52,625
Hotel Quebec? This is Lima Four.
Everything's set for Phase 3.

19
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,333
Santa Anna has taken his seat.

20
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:56,333
Same for
Morales and Sesma.

21
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,625
Copy that.

22
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,625
Hotel Quebec orders
all surveillance teams to

23
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,833
vacate the area and
regroup at the rendezvous point.

24
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,833
All units, this is
Hotel Quebec here.

25
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:19,166
You may proceed, Golf One.
Davy Crockett says Lone Star.

26
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,666
I repeat: Davy Crockett
says Lone Star.

27
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,416
Release code: check.

28
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,583
Target neutralized.

29
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,041
Right, let's bug out.

30
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,708
And no screw-ups.

31
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,708
He was a beloved father
and a treasured friend.

32
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,291
He protected the
weak and the helpless

33
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,791
Father was a good man. He
didn't do anything bad! Did he?

34
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:51,291
The Master has a place
in Heaven waiting for him.

35
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,708
May he rest in eternal peace.

36
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,875
There was no shame in
the way he lived his life.

37
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:02,833
So why, why would
God do this? Why?!

38
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,416
It was not God.

39
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,250
There is no greater killer
of man... than man himself.

40
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:11,125
Don't they feel anything?

41
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,666
How can people do
something like this?!

42
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,125
I know the answer
to that. I know it too well!

43
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,916
And that's why
I can never tell you!

44
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,916
You can come out, Rosarita.
They're leaving now.

45
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:44,416
Sorry about the trouble.

46
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,541
I will leave as
soon as the sun goes down.

47
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,041
Don't be in such a rush.

48
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,208
My best friend's daughter
has clearly travelled a long,

49
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,958
hard road and it would
dishonor my family name

50
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,000
if I didn't show
her some hospitality.

51
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,875
We should sit
for a while and talk.

52
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,166
Maybe even discuss your future.

53
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
Sound good?

54
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,500
I think running for your life

55
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:08,583
through the mountains
can wait in my opinion.

56
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,625
Senor Diego?

57
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,125
Sorry, just doing some chores.

58
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,625
It's such a
beautiful day I thought

59
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,666
I would do a
little gardening.

60
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,833
Why? You should
leave that to the gardener.

61
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,750
Yes, but this old
manor no longer has any staff.

62
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,458
In that case, Senor,
where should I start?

63
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,666
No, that's okay. You're
my guest, you should relax.

64
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,708
It would be unseemly to
spend a day without working.

65
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,833
To look like a maid and do
nothing would pain my heart.

66
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,375
At least treat me as if I were
truly a servant of the family.

67
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:55,291
Look at these, Roberta.

68
00:06:55,375 --> 00:07:00,500
What are they? Is there some
significance to these guns?

69
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,583
These weapons have
been in our family since

70
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:05,333
the very first Lovelace
landed on the shores

71
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,666
of the New World
with Francisco Pizarro.

72
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,791
They've been with us
through good times and bad,

73
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:15,166
but seeing them just slumbering
like this makes the days

74
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,375
when we forged our family
motto seem long ago, indeed.

75
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,833
"A blessing for the living."

76
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,708
"A branch of
flowers for the dead."

77
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,875
"With a sword for justice."

78
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,291
And "The punishment of
death for the villains."

79
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:34,208
Those are just words.
Young Master.

80
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,000
I had to hold my tongue, I
wanted to tell you the truth,

81
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:40,250
but it's just too cruel!
Forgive me!

82
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,041
What did they feel
when they killed him?

83
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,833
They felt nothing.

84
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:52,375
There was no need for them
to even harden their hearts.

85
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,083
For one simple reason.

86
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,458
Because they had
emptied themselves

87
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:04,291
of all emotion to begin with.
His death was nothing to them.

88
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,583
It was just a
matter of routine.

89
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,666
This is a path
I've travelled before.

90
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,000
If I am to burn
in Hell, then so be it.

91
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,791
But neither the Master,
nor the Young Master,

92
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,250
should suffer for my sins!

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,333
Young Master...

94
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:30,000
Since that night in
that cesspool, Roanapur,

95
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,833
I believed I would
never pull another trigger.

96
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:36,000
I won't dignify
this by calling it revenge.

97
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,125
This is about dogs
tearing at each other!

98
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,000
I swear by Santa Maria, I
shall seek out those mongrels,

99
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,833
and rip out their throats!

100
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,083
The NSA have
been real cocksuckers

101
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,208
about this whole affair.

102
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,416
It's obvious they're horning
in on our territory here.

103
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,041
Do you know where
that unit was based

104
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,333
before heading to Roanapur?
Manila, for chrissake.

105
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:07,750
Goddamn them. Why do
they want to shit in the

106
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,625
nice little garden
we've been growing out there?

107
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,750
Cathy, another cup!

108
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,541
And add enough milk
and sugar to make pancakes!

109
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,458
I'm putting
Dr. Kaufman on the line.

110
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,666
Okay, then.

111
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,875
Well, my fellow spooks.
The game is all about getting

112
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,666
as much as you can
without starting a war.

113
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,708
And that's how it's played.

114
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,000
I am reporting live from
the scene of the crime downtown.

115
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,583
Anything new?

116
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,625
No, everything's still the same.

117
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,708
The borders with
Laos are still closed.

118
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,416
They're on full alert.

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
And considering our
issues with the Thai Air Force,

120
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,583
an air insertion is a negative.

121
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:54,333
So we have to stay on standby.

122
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:57,583
We're messing around in
the CIA's backyard, Major.

123
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,708
This is all about politics now.

124
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,416
Give me a fuckin' break.

125
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,708
...to the bank patrons as a
result of police fire

126
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,083
are still unse...

127
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,208
What's the name of
this place, Ray?

128
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,083
Sir?

129
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,125
Where the hell are we?

130
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:13,208
Ah! This is Roanapur, Major.

131
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,833
It's a real shithole.

132
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,000
First fucking day here,

133
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,875
seven of the men
had their pockets picked.

134
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,708
The whores are
right out on the street,

135
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,833
and the damn police
are their best customers!

136
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,750
All this gutter trash.
You know what it reminds me of?

137
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,958
Yeah, I know
what you're thinking.

138
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:39,958
'Nam, sixty-nine. Saigon. I'll
never forget that fuckin' smell.

139
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,333
Look, a Japanese businessman.

140
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,333
What?

141
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,291
Well there's a
fish out of water.

142
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,000
Jesus Christ. It's hotter
than hell out there

143
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,875
and he's still wearing
a dumb-assed necktie.

144
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,083
You see that?

145
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,208
He doesn't even
know he just got robbed.

146
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,083
Hey! What do you
think you're doing, you?!

147
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,833
You know who
I am, motherfucker?

148
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,333
Uh... the Lagoon crew.

149
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,333
The dumb dipshit who
owns this wallet is with us.

150
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,041
See, we got a
reputation to think of.

151
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,916
Teach your little bum-boys
about the food chain here.

152
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,500
Now beat it. Fuck off.

153
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:37,625
Uh. If this is about
your payment, we could use--

154
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,625
We don't believe
in working on credit.

155
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,416
We only made
an exception because

156
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,541
the Columbian Cartel
vouched for you.

157
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,750
Be careful you
don't dishonor their name.

158
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah well, this isn't
the best place to talk.

159
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:56,500
It's a bit noisy here,
but maybe we can, uh--

160
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,500
Oh! Sounds like
the game just ended.

161
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,625
Please, come on in.

162
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,458
I'll pass. But you
should know that there's

163
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:08,291
a stone-cold killer behind me.
And she's got you in her sights.

164
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I see, uh... We'll
have the money tomorrow.

165
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:14,083
Tomorrow, then.

166
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,875
Rock.

167
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,208
You should have let the
street urchin keep the money.

168
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,833
It's not like I
have a lot leftover

169
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,875
from my paycheck anyway.

170
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,708
Because you're
such a fuckin' softie,

171
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,500
the brat would go
after even fatter wallets.

172
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:46,541
Before too long, he'd be
a floater in the river.

173
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,958
Dumbass.

174
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:51,458
You just blindly want
to help people out, don't ya?

175
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:54,166
You know, people
like the girl in the

176
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,833
photo you've
got stuffed in here.

177
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,125
You looked?

178
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,083
Yeah, I peeked inside.

179
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,916
A bullet never hits
you in the same place twice.

180
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,541
If I told you it's a good luck
charm, would you believe me?

181
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:31,041
Give me a fuckin' break, Rock.
This is gettin' to be a habit.

182
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,583
The skeletons on the
U-boat. The Romanian twins.

183
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,625
And then that Yakuza's daughter.

184
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,833
You did your best
to help them and in the end

185
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,041
your half-assed efforts were

186
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:45,166
completely fucking
pointless, Rock.

187
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,625
"Pointless" is
this city's motto.

188
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,875
"Come to beautiful Roanapur,

189
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,916
we have a coffin
waiting just for you."

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,958
God, I love this place.

191
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,666
Lagoon Company.

192
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,166
Yeah... Hmm...

193
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,375
And why do you wanna know?

194
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,791
Beats me. I'm just
the messenger boy.

195
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,416
The Chief just told
me to call you up and ask.

196
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,458
Fine. Damn it.

197
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,916
We in trouble?

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,250
Nope. I was asked if we'd
had an unusual visitor yet.

199
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,583
Again? That's just creepy!
They keep calling us!

200
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,125
Everyone from Isaac,

201
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,916
the fence down by the docks,
to Watsap at the police station

202
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,041
is obsessed with a visitor
we haven't even seen yet.

203
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,250
Who the hell
are they talking about?

204
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,458
I just heard
the most fucked up news.

205
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,166
It's from Kowalski
at Hotel Moscow.

206
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,166
What?

207
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,375
He said he saw
her here in town.

208
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,041
Who, his mother?

209
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,708
The maid, Dutch. The one
with the shitload of weapons

210
00:14:56,791 --> 00:15:00,083
who came all the way here
from some ass-pit in Venezuela.

211
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,958
You know, to rescue
that little prick we kidnapped.

212
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:06,166
The four-eyed,
fuckin' super terrorist.

213
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,083
Well, this is
a kick in the balls.

214
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:12,000
Ain't it? Look Revy, I wanna
find out what's going on fast,

215
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,791
before I get blown up. I'm
gonna check out a few places.

216
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,208
We'll meet at the Yellow Flag.

217
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,625
Well, our mystery
guest has checked in.

218
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,458
Yeah?

219
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,541
Damn, what a pain.

220
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:26,916
Aw, hell. This bar has
been trashed fifteen times

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,375
since seventy-eight, and
completely destroyed six times!

222
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,583
And the last shit-storm
when that killing machine

223
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,458
disguised as a
fucking maid showed up

224
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,083
was the worst one of all!

225
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,500
That's a sad story.

226
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,291
But you shouldn't worry
about crap you can't control.

227
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:44,083
I asked all the women upstairs,
but they were clueless.

228
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,000
Let me know
if shit goes down.

229
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,333
Sure.

230
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,375
So the Triad is searching
for the maid as well?

231
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,333
It's like the whole city
has got a hard-on for her.

232
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:56,000
Heh. Another group.
Columbians, this time.

233
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,833
Yo, Gustavo!

234
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,375
Hey, a couple of Lagoon's crew.

235
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,125
Where's Senor Abrego?

236
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,708
The boss is
holed up in the office,

237
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,750
we got a little situación.

238
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,750
Soldiers from the
head office are coming,

239
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,541
but we don't have
any more room for them,

240
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,166
it's a big pain
in the ass, I tell you.

241
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,750
But you know I think blessed
Maria must love me today!

242
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:19,125
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

243
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:22,000
Lemme guess.
About the maid, right?

244
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,500
You just said
you're getting soldiers

245
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,625
straight from the head office.

246
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,583
Now what else would you
be fuckin' talking about?

247
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,041
Jesus, wipe that look
off your face, wouldja?

248
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:35,583
We'd be happy to
talk to you for some intel!

249
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,291
Or fuck off.

250
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,833
You have our word we
won't leak this, fair enough?

251
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,750
Puta madre!

252
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,333
But you two
are gonna go first!

253
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,208
All right.
So where do we start?

254
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,083
None of us
actually saw the bitch

255
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:53,333
the last time she came in here.

256
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,375
What's she look like?
Her personality?

257
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,750
Any unique shit.

258
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:59,666
She has black hair. She's
Hispanic with pale skin.

259
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,000
I hear she's
dressed like a waitress?

260
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,916
She's fucking nuts.
She has a SPAS-12 umbrella

261
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,041
and enough small arms
and grenades in her case

262
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,166
to outfit an
entire rifle company.

263
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,750
Fuck me, this sounds bad!

264
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,333
I told you, remember?
She's bat-shit crazy.

265
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:32,916
Is... Is this
some kind of joke?

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,958
The Lagoon Company's
office seems to be

267
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,250
closed at the moment.

268
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,625
And The Young Master
talked of this establishment,

269
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,833
so I came here on my search.

270
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:45,083
The Young Master is waiting
at the Sankan Palace Hotel.

271
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,125
Please go to him
immediately. Right now.

272
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:53,041
Uh. Excuse me, but
are you with the Lovelaces?

273
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:56,916
Oh, pardon me. I am a
maid for the Lovelace family,

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,208
one of the thirteen
great families of South America.

275
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,541
My name is Fabiola Iglesias.

276
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,291
I hate her! She talks just
like that bitch in glasses.

277
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:09,333
I beg your pardon, but
you shouldn't be calling our

278
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:13,250
head maid a "bitch in glasses."
Please take that back.

279
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,708
Hermano, is this that maid?

280
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,958
No, man! But fuck
are we ever lucky!

281
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:22,500
This little puta just gave
us the clue we were looking for.

282
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:26,083
This kid is heavy, real heavy.

283
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,125
This article came up
when I started my search.

284
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,000
Last October terrorists set off
a bomb in Barinas, Venezuela.

285
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,583
In South America, that's
like talking about the weather.

286
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,458
Their target was a
political party, the MVR.

287
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,125
A new organization.

288
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,291
They were popular with the poor,

289
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,875
but the elites
weren't too fond of them.

290
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,500
Problem is the
Lovelace patriarch

291
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,458
was also taken
out in that explosion.

292
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:50,791
Holy shit.

293
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,708
He may have been one
of the elites, but in fact,

294
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,708
he was pretty
liberal in his thinking.

295
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,500
But it still doesn't add up.

296
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,333
What does any of that
have to do with Roanapur?

297
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,875
Alright, Mini-maid,
how about you start talking,

298
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,791
cuz we're all real
big fans of your head maid.

299
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:08,250
My apologies, but I
don't know where she is myself.

300
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,875
Then why don't we go look
for her together, little chica?

301
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:15,041
And we'll start with
that Sankan Palace Hotel.

302
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:17,500
I have been careless.

303
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,416
From the foul
stench I knew this town

304
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,791
would be filled with animals.

305
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,250
But then our
family's mortal enemies

306
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,083
have always
smelled like dirty pigs.

307
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,708
I got her, hermano!

308
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,000
We can go now?

309
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,208
Que?

310
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:41,041
F-Fucking little puta!
She stabbed me in the cojones!

311
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,291
Hey, no guns
allowed in-- okay.

312
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,666
She's not just some
fucking housekeeper!

313
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,291
She's like that other bitch!

314
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,208
Aw, now you've
drawn your weapons.

315
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,041
I was hoping to avoid this.

316
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,250
Hidalgo!

317
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,833
Right here, boss!

318
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,166
Frisk that little bitch!
And be fucking careful!

319
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,833
Who the hell knows what
this loca puta is packing.

320
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,708
Let's roll.

321
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,666
Ah, shit!

322
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,500
She's using buckshot!
Be careful!

323
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,458
Dammit, Revy, you started this!

324
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,291
Calm down, ya pussy!

325
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,416
I need the phone!

326
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,541
Hey, don't come back here!

327
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,791
Asshole!

328
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:04,833
Uh-oh... Benny!

329
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,000
You know, this is just a guess
but, I think it'll be tough

330
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,625
to get a drink
at the Flag tonight.

331
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:13,375
Yeah. But I bet the place
is gonna to be well-ventilated.

332
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,541
Give it some gas!

333
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,958
Hang on!

334
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
She's pretty good alright!

335
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,875
Hey, Boss, we're here!

336
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,666
Light this fucking place up!

337
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,791
No, you shitheads!

338
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,791
Open fire now!
The maid's in here!

339
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,791
The maid!

340
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,250
Marrero! Shoot the bar!

341
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,666
That psycho's in there!

342
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,833
Give her hell!

343
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,583
It's just like Roberta
said! A terrible city!

344
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,083
Listen to me, you cowards!

345
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,583
Your friends out there
really don't care about you!

346
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:21,500
You are nothing to them!
Live or die, what'll it be?!

347
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:24,250
Now gather your
wounded and get the hell out!

348
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,708
Retreat! Retreat!

349
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,500
Honestly, this place
is a rat's nest.

350
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,916
You're dead!

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,458
Hey, asshole. I think
it's time to hit the showers.

352
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,333
Crazy bitches!

353
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:50,500
Mr. Chang, it appears the
Colombians are falling back.

354
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:54,375
There's nothing to be gained
from us rushing over there now.

355
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,583
Especially if the stories
about the maid's past are true.

356
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:04,041
Do you think this is all
about revenge for her master?

357
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,458
Makes sense, Boss.

358
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:10,458
I just feel like I'm
pissing into the wind here.

359
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,166
Uh, Sir?

360
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,791
What I mean is, why can't we

361
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:17,041
track down this maid
everyone is talking about?

362
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,958
There's a stranger
hiding somewhere in my city.

363
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,375
And I hate that.

364
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,833
I'm a little speechless.

365
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,333
Does everyone in your
house dress for a small war?

366
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,625
So cool!

367
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,416
Oh no, it's just
the head maid and me.

368
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,958
So altogether, there are five
of us on the household staff

369
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:39,541
right now, but none of the other
maids know that I carry guns.

370
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,625
I was hired to ensure
the Young Master was

371
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,875
never left unprotected
when the head maid

372
00:23:43,958 --> 00:23:45,750
was away from the manor.

373
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,041
Sankan Palace. It doesn't
get much ritzier than this.

374
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,208
Wish I could
afford to stay here.

375
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,833
Allow me to remind you...
You'll be in the presence of

376
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:06,125
Master Garcia Fernando
Lovelace, the twelfth head

377
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,791
of the Lovelace
family, one of the

378
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,375
thirteen Great Families
of South America...

379
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:19,500
The Lagoon crew at last.
What took you so long?

380
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:25,833
Oops.

381
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,750
Easy cutie,
let's just keep our cool.

382
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:36,625
Fabiola, the gentleman is only
here to talk. He gave his word.

383
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:46,250
Be on your guard. This city is
filled with the vilest of scum.

384
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:50,250
Sorry to interrupt.
You want us to come in or what?

385
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,041
Yes, of course.
Please come in!

386
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,708
Before we begin...

387
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:03,125
Revy, ask for permission
before you light up that smoke.

388
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:06,375
Are you shittin' me?
Like I'm gonna ask him!

389
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,666
Revy.

390
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,875
Oh for-- All right then.
Uh, so listen, kid.

391
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,916
May I please enjoy my
hard-earned tobacco product?

392
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,500
We have no ashtrays here.
Please save it for later.

393
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,208
Jesus.

394
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,708
Following my father's death,

395
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,833
the members of a right wing
militia group were arrested.

396
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,000
Take out the leaders of

397
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,041
the leftist opposition
party with a bomb?

398
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,291
Sounds reasonable enough.

399
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,791
Hmm, it's so clean and
logical that it can't be legit.

400
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:39,083
Roberta felt the same.

401
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,416
They lacked the expertise to
pull off that kind of operation,

402
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,291
and there was no need for it.

403
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:48,208
But the police were acting
as if the case was closed.

404
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,541
That's how things stood
until the day some officers

405
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,208
from the airborne
regiment came to my house.

406
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,083
The Fifth Republic
Movement known as the MVR.

407
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,041
The party was founded by
Venezuelan airborne officers.

408
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:03,083
A lot of leftists in that unit.

409
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:04,375
They came to tell me about

410
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,625
the investigation
they'd been conducting.

411
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:10,875
And how they'd reviewed the
staff records for the ceremony.

412
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:14,291
Some men vanished
immediately after the bombing.

413
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,791
So they did a full
background check on them.

414
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,291
And hit a bull's eye.

415
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:20,666
Yes. The names
of six of those men

416
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,916
popped up in
other records as well.

417
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:28,500
They'd been members of
a foreign intelligence agency.

418
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:31,458
And, as if pre-planned,
they'd all resigned

419
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,916
from active duty
two months ago.

420
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,583
The day of the
bombing they were all

421
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:39,041
on the security
detail guarding the stage.

422
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:42,000
Shit, that's just retarded!
Keeping their old identities

423
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:44,500
like that is such
sloppy fuckin' work.

424
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,208
Go home and
jerk off or whatever,

425
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:49,166
because four-eyes will be right
back after she massacres 'em.

426
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,125
Fabiola, the photo.

427
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,250
Yes, sir.

428
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:54,416
Take a look at this.

429
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,291
The officers also provided
us with this photograph.

430
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,041
This was in Caracas six
months before the bombing.

431
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,958
While looking into
a case of embezzlement,

432
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,791
military investigators
just happened to

433
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,208
get a picture of them.

434
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,416
The man on the far right,
Major Marcos Lucientes,

435
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,791
is the leader
of the six conspirators.

436
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,125
He's a foreign
intelligence operative.

437
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,666
And the others?

438
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,166
They're not Venezuelan.

439
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,041
After she saw that,
Roberta seemed different.

440
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:27,958
Young Master. Do you remember
that night in Roanapur?

441
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:34,250
Of course I do. The Columbian
Cartel tried to sell me

442
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:38,083
like I was a piece of meat.
And then you crossed the ocean

443
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:42,375
and saved me from them!
You did so much for me.

444
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:46,000
When you were taken
from us, Master Diego tried to

445
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,000
prevent me
from going after you,

446
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,333
but in the end,
there was no choice.

447
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:51,083
If he had--

448
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,333
I understand.

449
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,000
If it had been me
instead of my father.

450
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,958
I would have
tried to stop you, too.

451
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:01,875
Yes. The two of you
are from another time.

452
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,916
Roberta, stay.

453
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,583
Not to worry, Young Master.

454
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:13,583
Know that wherever you are,
I shall always be at your side.

455
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:17,208
But the next day,
she was gone.

456
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,208
Dammit, who the hell is she?

457
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,458
Mendes, it's me!
Someone is on my tail.

458
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,041
Hurry and get
over here right away--

459
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,625
I am afraid that
Mendes is unable to

460
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,583
answer the
phone at the moment.

461
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,791
What the--? Who is this?!

462
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:00,041
Shouldn't the question be, "How
did you get his cell phone?"

463
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:03,000
Isn't that what
you should be asking?

464
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,625
And I have more
than just Mendes' phone.

465
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,916
But they couldn't help me.

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,208
It appears that
you are the only one

467
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:17,250
who can answer
all of my questions.

468
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,208
They found Jose
Lucientes' body in a canal

469
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,875
on the outskirts of Calabozo.

470
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,250
She was able to
identify and track him down

471
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,291
from a single photo?

472
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,000
Impressive, I can
see how she earned

473
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,750
the nickname "Bloodhound."

474
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:34,708
Uh...

475
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:38,166
She is not a bloodhound!
She's my family!

476
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:44,041
A thousand pardons,
Senor Garcia. Let us resume.

477
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:49,208
Yes. Back to
the business at hand.

478
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,875
Her next target was
the second man from the right.

479
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,166
I'm important!

480
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,333
Do you have any idea who I am?

481
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:59,083
Yes, I do. You're with the NSA,

482
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,833
America's National
Security Agency.

483
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:05,000
You're Colonel Simon Dickens,
a specialist in Central America

484
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,916
and the officer in
charge of a unique program

485
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,958
that conducts policy
analysis in the region.

486
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,750
Jesus Christ, so you've
done your homework.

487
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,375
What do you want?!

488
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,291
According to the late
Marcos Jose Lucientes,

489
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,416
you and your men were
responsible for planning

490
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
and carrying out the
terrorist bombing attack

491
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,208
in Caracas, Venezuela
last October.

492
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:29,958
No! You wouldn't!

493
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:34,375
I want to know
where your hounds are.

494
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,791
You should start talking
before you begin to cook.

495
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:42,458
It would save us
both a lot of time.

496
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:47,833
Don't... don't do this,
you fucking psycho bitch!

497
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,791
If you kill me you're gonna have
every single American agency

498
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,125
gunning for your
crazy fuckin' ass!

499
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,875
I'm waiting.

500
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,041
Colonel Dickens' body was
found in the burned out ruins

501
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,750
of a building in
a suburb of Caracas.

502
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,125
The main suspect is
a woman who inquired about

503
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,958
buying a ticket from
Venezuela to Thailand via Miami.

504
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:17,041
She also made a reservation
for a long-distance bus to

505
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,208
take her from
the airport to Roanapur.

506
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,750
She went after a
United States Army colonel?

507
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,625
You're sure about that?

508
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,916
Yes.

509
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,416
Sorry, kid, this
sounds like a real mess.

510
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,666
So what'd ya want from
us besides fuckin' sympathy?

511
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,375
I need some help.

512
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,125
Fuckin' motherfuckin' fucks!

513
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:42,500
What's wrong, Bao?
You remodeling again?

514
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,000
Shuddup!

515
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,666
If you assholes wanna drink,
then I got the booze.

516
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,375
Hey, you. Do I look
like I'm fuckin' open?

517
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,000
If you're here to tease--

518
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,625
War is coming.

519
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:11,583
I can see why you're so
nervous about this, Chang.

520
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:16,416
You can't pay us enough.
We're gonna sit this one out.

521
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,083
No, why?!

522
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:21,125
Don't ya get it? Your head maid
has just declared a showdown

523
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:25,166
with everyone's favorite
buddy, the U.S. of fucking A.

524
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:28,083
Sorry, what'd ya just say?

525
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:31,125
I want to know the locations
of all the nearby shops

526
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:34,291
that carry
weapons and ammunition.

527
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,333
There is a war coming.

528
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,416
Every corner of this
city is filled with people

529
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
who struggle
against overwhelming odds

530
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:46,416
and fail and are
now just waiting to die.

531
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,166
We're not interested
in hiring your company.

532
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,583
That is not why
I came looking for you.

533
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:57,333
We're hiring him.
The Japanese man there.

534
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,375
Hold on. Do you mean me?

535
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:08,041
You do! Now wait a minute!
Why do you want me?!

536
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,541
Our head maid is
somewhere in this city.

537
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,333
Please help us find her!

538
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:15,750
I know this is a lot
to ask of you. But, please!

539
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:19,041
You want me?! You're both nuts!

540
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:38,291
If you are the gun,
then I am the bullet.

541
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,416
But I am nothing more
than a simple chunk of lead.

542
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,416
To fire the gun,
you need gunpowder.
