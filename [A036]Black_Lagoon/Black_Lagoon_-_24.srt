00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,250
[YUKIO] Ginji.

2
00:00:43,083 --> 00:00:47,833
I see that I've woken you, Miss.
Please excuse my carelessness.

3
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:55,250
The future that you
envision for us...

4
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,125
...to leave this
dirty country behind

5
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,916
and raise the flag of
justice on foreign soil.

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,875
To rebuild the family there and
take on the city of villains...

7
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,000
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

8
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:07,375
But we've learned
from experience

9
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,500
what those Russians
are capable of.

10
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,250
We know they won't
make it easy for us.

11
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,666
I'm going to cut a path
through those soldiers

12
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,458
and challenge this
Balalaika one-on-one.

13
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:19,041
I've faced many who were not,

14
00:01:19,125 --> 00:01:22,333
but she is undoubtedly
worthy of this white sheath.

15
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,208
I do appreciate your loyalty

16
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,500
and I've come
this far with you.

17
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:30,916
So, I'll... be with
you from now on.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Does that include... Roanapur?

19
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,541
[YUKIO] Yes.

20
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,833
[BALALAIKA] Excellent work.

21
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,541
Thanks to you,
it looks like this job

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,458
will end without incident.

23
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,791
As for me, my work
here is done.

24
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,416
Someone from Moscow
will be taking over now.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,000
So, this is it.

26
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,250
If I have any regrets,

27
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,583
it's that I won't get
to see the aftermath.

28
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,250
It really is a shame.

29
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:20,125
Hey, Ishiguro.

30
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,750
The three that went inside...

31
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,000
Huh? What about them?

32
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,416
Whaddaya mean
"What about them"?!

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,708
The two Caucasians and the
Japanese that came here...

34
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,291
Have you investigated
them yet?

35
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,750
Yes, of course.

36
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,250
I've got someone
looking, but...

37
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,916
What about our request for
an international specialist?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,458
Yeah. Some guy named Kouno's
supposed to be on his way here.

39
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,708
I can tell ya right now,
that woman's definitely

40
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,000
involved in this war
between Washimine and Kousa.

41
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,625
She might be
behind the shooting

42
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,458
at the bowling alley in Adachi.

43
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:49,708
So, whatever you do, don't
let 'em outta your sight.

44
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:50,875
Mhm.

45
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:58,583
[ROCK] What is it?

46
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,666
Nothing. It's just judging
by your expression,

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,041
it looks like you might
have something to say.

48
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,958
Well, am I wrong?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,458
Miss Balalaika...

50
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,583
And please, tell me this isn't
what we talked about before.

51
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,541
Uh...

52
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,791
[BALALAIKA] Let me remind you,

53
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:19,041
I've already spared your
life once on this trip.

54
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,250
But all the same,

55
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,375
if you have another
favor to ask, speak now.

56
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,708
There is something...

57
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,958
Well, no promises.

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,666
Alright. I'd just
like to say one thing.

59
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,958
If all of this is about
to come to an end,

60
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,500
...before we go...

61
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:40,875
...I'd like you to destroy
the Washimine Clan.

62
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:42,125
To the point...

63
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,458
To the point where their
survival is impossible.

64
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:47,791
Cut them down until
not even a stump remains.

65
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,875
Only that will free her.
And nothing less.

66
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,458
I... see...
your... point.

67
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,750
I see. I see. Indeed.

68
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,625
That would be the only
way to force the princess

69
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,916
back into some
kind of normal life.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,833
Or at least,
the quickest way.

71
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,583
Quite devious, Rock.
Excellent decision.

72
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:21,166
I'm starting to think there
may still be hope for you.

73
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,166
Please forgive my delay.

74
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,333
[ROCK translating to Japanese]

75
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm certain that
by now, you must be

76
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:30,458
exhausted from all
these long discussions.

77
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:35,500
[speaking in Japanese]

78
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,291
Look, Mr. Kousa.

79
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,250
At this point, we
have to make plans

80
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,833
regarding who will
succeed us in the future.

81
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,125
[translating to Japanese]

82
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,375
[KOUSA] Hm?

83
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,708
[BALALAIKA] The fact is
if certain contingencies

84
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,541
should occur in our absence,
it will be difficult

85
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,250
for us to respond properly.

86
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,000
Therefore, I wish to know
your state of readiness

87
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,583
in terms of firearms.

88
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,250
[ROCK translating to Japanese]

89
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,291
Is it adequate?

[speaking in Japanese]

91
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,875
Would you oblige me?

00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,458

94
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,291
Oh, and I'd like to see
the bullets, as well.

00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,541
Hm...

97
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,833
I see.

98
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,958
That's quite the competent
bodyguard you have.

99
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,791
Do you have a backup means
of protection, by any chance?

100

What is this?

103
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,666
This gun is
absolutely atrocious!

104
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,375
Keep up with me here, Rock.

Take a look at this, Sergeant.

108
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,708
Atrocious, isn't it?

109
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,166
Even the biggest pansy wouldn't

110
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,833
be caught dead with
a gun like this.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,041
Absolutely atrocious.
What a hideous gun.

[translating to Japanese]

113
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,250
Have you ever
stopped to consider...

114
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,416
...what it would feel like

115
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,458
to be shot with a
pathetic gun like this?

116
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,125
That's it.

117
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,041
I'm afraid I cannot
work with anyone

118
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,583
who'd be willing to carry
a firearm this loathsome.

119
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,750
Frankly, it's embarrassing.

Either you open
it, or we will!

This gun wasn't
so bad, after all.

How are we for time?

No problem there, <i>Kapitän</i> .

But, umm... how will we
explain this to the boss?

134
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:37,125
[BALALAIKA] As I recall,
Pyotr told me to make war

135
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,333
and burn it all to
ashes before we left.

136

...that you pull this trigger.

00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,791
--[OFFICER 2] Stop there!
--[OFFICER 1] Get him!

182
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,583
[OFFICERS] Get back here!
Don't let him get away!

183
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,291
[BALALAIKA] Calm down!

184
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,500
We're the ones you want
to talk to, not them.

185
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,916
Don't get distracted
by small fry.

186
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,333
I guess this is goodbye,
civilian cop.

187
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,333
Oh, if you do need to
reach me for some reason,

188
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,625
please contact Mr. Walijinov,

189
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,458
First Secretary, Embassy
of the Russian Federation.

190
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,666
Don't be a stranger, okay?

191
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,000
'Scuse me.

192
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,625
Goddamn it!

193
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,916
I didn't make it in time!

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,250
Who are you?

195
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,708
Kouno with International
Investigations.

196
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:14,666
I don't get it. Why
didn't you arrest them?

197
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,875
I mean, you heard
gunshots, right?

198
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,250
It happened inside the
house. We had no proof.

199
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,541
So, who in the hell
was that woman, anyway?

200
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,041
Did you find out?

201
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,625
That one... She's a big fish.

202
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,458
She's part of Hotel Moscow,
the Russian Mafia

203
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,333
with strong footholds as far
as New York and Chechnya.

204
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,958
Balalaika.

205
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,875
That's the name
that woman goes by.

206
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,250
She's one of their
highest ranking officers.

207
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,166
What?!

208
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,166
Damn it!

209
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,416
Ugh.

210
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,916
Attention! Crime scene
to dispatch!

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,333
Send a message to all
patrol cars in the area!

212
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,333
Well, did someone
get a picture of her?

213
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,958
A description at least?

214
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,958
No.

215
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,791
Well, get a sketch
made up ASAP.

216
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,875
In the meantime, I'm gonna try

217
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,791
and track down her
Japanese contact!

218
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,166
Revy!

219
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,791
Before we leave, we hafta
tell her that the war's over!

220
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,750
[REVY] You outta your mind?!
In just over thirty minutes,

221
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,041
this whole place is
gonna be quarantined!

222
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,333
You're not gonna see her!

223
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,166
We don't have time.
Contact her from the ship.

224
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,041
Or they're gonna
leave without us!

225
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,708
But...

226
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,791
[crashing sound]

227
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,500
[YUKIO] Mr. Okajima.

228
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,333
Is that Yukio?

229
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,708
[YUKIO] Mr. Okajima.

230
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,375
Please escort Ginji and
me to the Maria Zeleska.

231
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:44,916
Miss.

232
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,500
[REVY] Fuckin' unbelievable!

233
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,041
Now he's been kidnapped
by a high school girl!

234
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,500
Are you old enough to drive?

235
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,791
Well, why not, right?

236
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,458
Okay, and what's
this farce about you

237
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,250
moving the family to Roanapur?

238
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,541
You know what?

239
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:14,250
I may be standing in
the twilight like you say,

240
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,750
but at least I have perspective.

241
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,375
Doesn't it sound fun?

242
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,250
Hotel Moscow has announced
an end to the fighting.

243
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,458
It's over!

244
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,666
I've witnessed first hand

245
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,125
what Balalaika's
promises are worth.

246
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,208
Yukio...

247
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,458
That woman's like a rabid dog.

248
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,958
Trust her... and it's
only a matter of time

249
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,291
before she bites.

250
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,916
She betrayed us once,
so why not again?

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,708
[honking]

252
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,291
[gunshots]

253
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,666
[honking]

254
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,375
Hey, asshole! I'm carjacking
you! Don't you get it?!

255
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,333
[YUKIO] If I could honestly
believe it was possible

256
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,375
to establish
ourselves in Roanapur

257
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:55,750
and rebuild the family there,
that'd be a wonderful feeling.

258
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,375
But it was just
a fleeting wish.

259
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,875
Anyway, as long as Ginji
and I are still here,

260
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,916
the Washimine Clan
and our emblem

261
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,666
will continue to exist.

262
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,291
We haven't been buried yet.

263
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,541
Why do you keep
coming back to that?

264
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,208
Like it or not, I was
born into the night.

265
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,916
I grew up with the night.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,916
Sure, I enjoyed playing
on the other side

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,541
and even pretending
I belonged,

268
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,458
but the night
was always there.

269
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:21,833
So, now I've decided
to embrace reality.

270
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,666
I'm not a member
of Hotel Moscow,

271
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
so I'll be of no value
to you as a hostage.

272
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
Then we'll use you as a shield.

273
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,375
At the very least, I want
you to see how this ends.

274
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:32,625
I think it's appropriate
after all we've been through.

275
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,666
There's nothing but a
massacre waiting for you!

276
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,750
Yes, you may be
right about that.

277
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,833
But where we die, a flower
may bloom in our place.

278
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,666
As yakuza, we accept that.

279
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,208
Damn it!

280
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,291
Comrades, the operation
is complete.

281
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,291
Let us return to Roanapur.

282
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,375
[cheering]

283
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,666
[honking]

284
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,208
She's here...

285
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,000
Where ya goin?!

286
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
Well, Miss?

287
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,125
[YUKIO] Whatever happens,

288
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,333
we can't be the ones to
give way in this battle.

289
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
What the hell is
wrong with you?!

290
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,166
See, Rock? I was right
about her, wasn't I?

291
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,708
She's already
the walking dead.

292
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,750
Revy!

293
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,416
I understand the Kousa Clan

294
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,333
has been dissolved due
to an internal dispute.

295
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,333
However, the one who betrayed

296
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:50,125
and then mercilessly
slaughtered Tsugio Bando,

297
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,166
the head of the Washimine Clan,
still lives.

298
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,041
That person is Balalaika,
the leader of Hotel Moscow.

299
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,916
We have always prided ourselves
on living with honor,

300
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,375
seeing justice through,
and rewarding loyalty.

301
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,083
Bullshit! You're
bound by no such duty!

302
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,250
That's a front
and you know it!

303
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,625
[YUKIO] Please allow us
to pass unharmed.

304
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,958
Ginji...

305
00:15:56,791 --> 00:16:00,166
[boat horn]

306
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,250
[REVY chuckling]

307
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,750
[ROCK] I'm afraid...

308
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,000
...that Ginji is
no longer with you.

309
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:44,333
You know,

310
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,250
I really shouldn't have
brought her here with me.

311
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:50,125
Why fight it? In the end,
you and I are the same.

312
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:53,375
No matter what we do,
we'll never be normal.

313
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,916
Where we are right now...

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,541
This is a place only
those like us should be.

315
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:02,291
Wouldn't you agree... lady?

316
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,833
There was a path
you could've chosen

317
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,500
to avoid ending up
like Miss Balalaika.

318
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:10,833
And I...

319
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,708
I always assumed that's
the one you would choose.

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,166
But I guess that's
where I was wrong.

321
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,083
Be honest with yourself.

322
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,791
This isn't about you
saving face as yakuza.

323
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,583
The truth is you wanted
to be part of the night

324
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:26,125
so you could be with him.

325
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:27,666
That's all this is.

326
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,666
Because I stand in the twilight,

327
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,125
I see things you can't.

328
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,041
You should've asked Ginji
to throw away his sword

329
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,625
and run away with him.

330
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,541
And become wanderers together,

331
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,750
seeking a far away land,
maybe open some shop...

332
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,291
That sounds like
a romantic comedy.

333
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,500
This is no comedy!

334
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,666
Where is the real you, anyway?!

335
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,000
[YUKIO] Sure,
I've often wondered,

336
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,541
"What if I'd been able
to live like that?"

337
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,916
But what's the point
of torturing myself?

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,791
I've already thrown my dice.

339
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,125
You know, secretly,
I always wished

340
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,000
that our life in Takamachi
would somehow go on forever.

341
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,916
With all the musicians
and the shops...

342
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,625
we always had so much
fun together there.

343
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:29,958
[gunshot]

344
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,083
Too late. Too damn late.

345
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,291
The only place people
like us end up...

346
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,291
...is a muddy hole in
the ground, my friend.

347
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,583
But you tried...
You did try to live.

348
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,625
Yukio...

349
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,958
[grunting]

350
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,166
[ROCK] Revy! Revy!

351
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,375
I'm alright. Damn.
I'm blacking out.

352
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:12,916
Those words that you
made her say back there...

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,625
In the end, that was the
bullet that killed him.

354
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,791
If it weren't for that,
I'd be on the ground.

355
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:23,166
Don't talk! This is
gonna hurt. Ready?

356
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,541
[REVY screaming]

357
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,708
Lift your leg up, Revy!
I've gotta stop the bleeding!

358
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,791
[YUKIO] Why?

359
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,416
Why did it have to
come to this, Ginji?

360
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,750
Everything became distorted

361
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:46,166
when you lied to yourself
that you wanted this.

362
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,375
But you were too
smart to believe it.

363
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:51,208
So, there was
no escape for you.

364
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,708
Eleven...

365
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,083
[ROCK] Huh?

366
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,041
That's the number of people

367
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,875
who've been killed
under my orders

368
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,958
since that night
I threw the dice.

369
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,625
Believe me... our
city's full of people

370
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,166
with blood on their hands!

371
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,541
Now that I've woken up,
I've realized...

372
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:09,666
...your city doesn't
have a place for me.

373
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,250
I apologize for
having troubled you.

374
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,208
I think it's best if I bring
all of this to an end now.

375
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,666
Don't look at her,
Rock! Look at me!

376
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,166
[slicing sound]

377
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:33,625
[boat horn]

378
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,291
[DUTCH] That you, Rock?

379
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,083
I feel like I haven't seen
you in a million years.

380
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:45,000
How'd you like the
fake Chinese-Canadian

381
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,666
passport I got you?

382
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,125
Heh. They love Canadians.

383
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,250
[ROCK] Dutch, I--

384
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,125
[DUTCH] Yeah, I've heard.

385
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,208
[ROCK] "People are like dice...

386
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,000
We can throw ourselves
in any direction."

387
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,000
Do you know the name of
the person who said that?

388
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,291
Wasn't it Jean-Paul Sartre?

389
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,625
The French existentialist
philosopher.

390
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,666
But I've got a
quote for ya, Rock.

391
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,791
It goes like this--

392
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,083
"Quickly put a hole
in a guy who tries

393
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:16,083
to put five eggs
into three baskets."

394
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:17,875
Now that speaks to me.

395
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,833
[ROCK] Yeah, I hear you.

396
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:21,791
[DUTCH] There's work
as soon as you get back.

397
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,000
The client wants us to
deliver a shitload of guns

398
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,333
by the day after tomorrow.

399
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,791
[ROCK] Later.

400
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,958
[REVY] We've got a plane
to catch, partner.

401
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,416
[BENNY] This came for you
from Miss Balalaika.

402
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,750
The good city
of Roanapur, huh...

403
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,875
Where the power of guns
meets the power of liquor.

404
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,250
You gotta
appreciate a place

405
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,458
where any problem can
be solved with brute force.

406
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,541
It's not such a bad place.

407
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,708
That's what I'm
beginning to think.

408
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,833
[ROCK] Yeah, it's not bad.

409
00:23:08,916 --> 00:23:11,416
I plan to watch everything
that goes on here.

410
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,541
I'll watch all of it from
right here in the twilight.

411
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,333
Alright. Let's
get going then.

412
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:20,583
Back to our
favorite shithole.

413
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,291
[EDA] And? How was Japan? Huh?

414
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:26,208
Well, we were there
working for Balalaika.

415
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,916
You know, new country,
same old bullshit.

416
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,125
What are you talking about?
I'm asking about Rock, bitch!

417
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,375
You two were away
together for a long time.

418
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:38,166
So, did you get some or what?

419
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,333
I don't wanna say.

420
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,125
[EDA] Huh?

421
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:43,750
[laughing]

422
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:47,250
When it comes to
you and men, huh?

423
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,208
You may as well be dead.

424
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,250
That's the thing...

425
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:55,166
We fuckers don't die so easy.

426
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,583
Bang.
