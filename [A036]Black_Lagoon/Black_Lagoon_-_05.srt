1
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,958
Well, are we out of
their missile range?

2
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,333
I think so.

3
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,541
We're safe if we
maintain this distance.

4
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,916
Assholes. We'll have to keep
an eye on them from here.

5
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:37,125
[explosion]

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,000
[REVY] Let's move.

7
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,833
What the hell are you
doing over there?

8
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,125
Hey, you alright?

9
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,458
You didn't warn me
about an explosion.

10
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,708
What if you accidentally
flooded the place?

11
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,375
You shouldn't be so reckless.

12
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,750
Listen, we can't afford to
be screwing around right now.

13
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,000
The more you whine,
the less time we have.

14
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,250
I understand all that,

15
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,416
but you could have said
something ahead of time.

16
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,958
[REVY] And how did you expect
me to talk underwater?

17
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,916
Why don't you try paying closer
attention to what I'm doing?

18
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,208
But still, at least give me a
signal when you do something...

19
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,666
Bones? Bones!

20
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,083
Well, yeah, there
are gonna be bones.

21
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,375
Look around you.
They're all over the place.

22
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,625
Listen, Rock,
this is a gravesite

23
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:36,125
that all of us living on
the surface have forgotten.

24
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,208
This is where death
came for all of them.

25
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,500
It was their time,
whether they wanted it or not.

26
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,708
No flowers or candles here.

27
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,416
No one comes to visit
and no one remembers.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,250
A rotting catacomb...
minus all the fucking saints.

29
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,166
I've never liked
these kinds of places.

30
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,166
Not at all.

31
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,291
Smells like something's been
rotting down here for ages.

32
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,250
If we stay too long,
it'll mess with our lungs.

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,916
Hey, Revy.

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,416
How do you think they felt...

35
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,125
...when they realized
they were stuck here?

36
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,458
What went through their minds

37
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,958
as the lights faded
and it got dark

38
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,208
and all they could do
was struggle to breathe?

39
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:29,791
[REVY] Now that's
just depressing.

40
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,958
Anyway, how the hell
should I know?

41
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,916
Dying 'cause you can't breathe 

42
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,875
can only feel like dying cause
you can't breathe and that's it.

43
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,208
How other people die
is just how other people die.

44
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,583
What does it matter? 

45
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,666
Thinking about it isn't
gonna do a damn thing, Rock.

46
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,250
Just try to think
happy thoughts.

47
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,166
Hey, look at these guys.

48
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,041
Seems like they staged
their own version

49
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,625
of Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

50
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,458
[gunshot]

51
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,791
Captain?

52
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,916
Captain!

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,708
You bastard!

54
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,583
[CREWMAN 2] How dare you!

55
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,875
Revy. This must be
the captain here.

56
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,458
[REVY] That Ahbe guy, right? 

57
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,833
Is his Iron Cross lying
around here somewhere?

58
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,750
It'll be worth something.

59
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:11,250
Hmm... Come over here.

60
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,166
This guy's uniform is
different. He's that SS.

61
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,250
And the painting?

62
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,833
I don't know where it is.

63
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:20,291
If it's not here,
it's in a safe.

64
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,166
I don't get it.
Why'd these guys bother

65
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,833
getting into a major shootout?

66
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,416
Desperation made them panic?

67
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,250
[REVY] Now that's
a laughable theory.

68
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,333
Despair is like the
last stages of cancer--

69
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,083
you've got nothing
left to lose.

70
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:37,250
Well, I don't know the details,

71
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,750
but I'd say this Gestapo
was the one that shot first.

72
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,291
After that, the sailors came in
here to avenge their captain.

73
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,833
And it all ended with
the Last Stand at the Alamo.

74
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:50,041
A ship's crew is like family. 

75
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:53,000
They wouldn't kill each other if
they knew they were gonna die.

76
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,375
The only one who'd
bother starting shit

77
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,083
would be the outsider.

78
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,875
[ROCK] Is that how it works?

79
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,416
[REVY] Yeah.

80
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,208
What'd ya find?

81
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,875
Got the goods?

82
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,958
This is it. It's an exact match.

83
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,541
Yeah! This has to be it!

84
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,500
You start putting it away
and I'll take care of the rest.

85
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,625
The rest? But we got
what we came for.

86
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,958
[REVY] We're not kids
running some errand, Rock.

87
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,291
If we don't grab everything
that's worth something,

88
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,166
then this trip's been
a waste of time.

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,875
I noticed the captain had
an Iron Cross with a sword.

90
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,333
It's a valuable item.

91
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,000
And it's a little too valuable
to leave behind as fish food,

92
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,416
--alright?
--But you--

93
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,958
Hold on!

94
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,166
[REVY] I'll be back when I've
got everything worth taking.

95
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,291
You can keep those guys company.

96
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,125
What are you looking at?

97
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,333
Quit staring. I'm not exactly
thrilled about it, either.

98
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:01,375
[DUTCH] What's our
distance, Benny-boy?

99
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,583
The last time I checked,
it was about 5,200 yards.

100
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,458
That puts us out
of their range.

101
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:12,041
Those guys are a dangerous
bunch, alright. Fucking crazy.

102
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,583
[DUTCH] And the fact
that they just launched

103
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,333
three of those things at once
means they're well-equipped.

104
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:20,208
[BENNY] They're parked
directly above that U-boat.

105
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,375
[DUTCH] And we can't
do a damn thing.

106
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,250
Take your positions!

107
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,875
Stand by for the
commander's instructions!

108
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,500
[RACHMANN] Gentlemen!
My devoted brothers-in-arms.

109
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Beloved braves of the
Aryan Socialist Union.

110
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,583
I stand here before you
filled with pride,

111
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,875
for today, we shall witness the
creation of a brave new world!

112
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,625
In one glorious stroke,

113
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,958
we will reclaim that
which was lost to us

114
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:49,708
as the result of meddling by the
Zionists and communists alike.

115
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,708
True patriots are counting
on you, brave soldiers!

116
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,666
This is the utmost
act of courage!

117
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,125
In the name of strict
order and patriotism,

118
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,750
you and you alone will be able
to restore the racial hierarchy

119
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,083
for the way it was meant to be!

120
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,375
Suicide corps--stand on guard!

121
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,291
Kruppen Feller!

122
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,833
You have been chosen
to fulfill this objective.

123
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:16,666
A true hero. You represent the
courage of the great Aryan race.

124
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,208
There has never...

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,750
There has never been a more
glorious moment than this

126
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:25,000
and I for one... I cannot
find words to express this.

127
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,208
I can only shed
these tears of joy.

128
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,250
I too am filled
with emotion, Commander.

129
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,625
I will sacrifice myself
to fulfill this sacred duty!

130
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,375
[STANDFORD] Commence
singing of our anthem!

131

[BENNY] Hey, hey, hey.
Get a load of this,

138
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,791
I think they're holding
a little concert.

139
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,208
Some Nazi marching song.

140
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,125
[DUTCH] Yeah, I hear 'em.

141
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,291
You start with some
random, useless guy,

142
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,416
put him on a podium,
give him some power,

143
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,916
and the next thing you know,

144
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,916
you've got a march-loving,
ego-tripping fool on your hands.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,916
Same shit as always.

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,666
And you, what do you think
as a white man, Benny-boy?

147
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,416
That kinda machismo
doesn't agree with me.

148
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,666
Besides, don't
forget I'm Jewish.

149
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,625
"Fuck the Nazis"
is a family creed.

150
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,416
[DUTCH] That's right, I forgot.

151
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,166
By the way,
are the beacons on yet?

152
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,166
Nope. It looks like both of them
are still in the submarine.

153
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,208
Unfortunately, there's nothing
we can really do at this point

154
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,541
but sit around and pick at
each other's politics.

155
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,250
I'm not that concerned
about the job,

156
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,541
but I am worried
about the time.

157
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,833
[DUTCH] Yeah, that's always
gonna be a problem.

158
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,125
If we had the time
to retrieve it,

159
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,375
I'd take the whole thing
back to the port.

160
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666
That way, I could've shown
that fancy dress parade

161
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,875
on that shit-heap boat what
their Führer went through.

162
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,875
Take a little bit of
the romance out of it.

163
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,125
I hear ya.

164
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,958
Hey, this isn't good.
Those guys are up to something.

165
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,000
Huh?

166
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,666
[BENNY] They're lowering
some kind of pod.

167
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,041
At this rate, there's gonna
be a showdown in the sub.

168
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,375
What now?

169
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,250
[DUTCH] There's nothing
we can do, Benny.

170
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,333
They still have TOWs. 

171
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,000
Just having to say
this pisses me off,

172
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,916
but we'll have to wait
till they give us a chance.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,833
So, for now, you'll have
to pray while you shit.

174
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,500
I'm afraid that's
about all we can do.

175
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,375
Phew! Not bad.

176
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,208
Aside from all those
Iron Crosses,

177
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,083
I found stuff the collectors
would drool over.

178
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,833
This place is a
grave robber's wet dream.

179
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,375
Revy.

180
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,916
I was thinking that maybe... 

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,458
[REVY] Hmm?

182
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,750
...we should leave
all that here.

183
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,250
[REVY] Okay, Rock,
you can spare me the rest.

184
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,000
Wait, I know,
"Thou shalt not steal"?

185
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:48,208
So, should I be calling
you "Father Rock" now?

186
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,041
That's not it.

187
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:54,000
These medals are proof
of what these people did.

188
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,041
We don't have the right
to take that away from them.

189
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:03,375
If anyone has the right
to these medals, it's them.

190
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,666
It's these people right here.

191
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,458
Don't you think?

192
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,083
I found it right
next to his body.

193
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:15,250
The captain had this photo
with him up until the very end.

194
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:18,125
The man had a family
waiting for him.

195
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,375
To us, these medals
are just antiques.

196
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,625
But to the people
who were left behind,

197
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,708
they're irreplaceable.

198
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,166
[REVY] Hmm.

199
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,833
So, that's how
you look at it, huh?

200
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:37,000
I see. Well, since we're here...

201
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:47,125
I've got a story that's perfect
for this sorta atmosphere.

202
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm gonna do you a favor

203
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,291
and let you in on a
little secret, Rock.

204
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,833
Okay?

205
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,583
Let me ask you something...

206
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,833
See this? And this?

207
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,500
What would you say
these two things are?

208
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,500
The first one's an old skull
and that's some sorta medal.

209
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:12,333
That's where you're wrong.
Both of these are just things. 

210
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,666
As soon as you strip
away their meanings,

211
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,166
then that's all
they really are.

212
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,291
Just things and nothing more.

213
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,458
And if you're gonna give these
things any kinda meaning again,

214
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,083
they won't get
any of their value

215
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,583
because they're
someone's precious memory.

216
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,208
Their value will be determined

217
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,625
by the one thing
everybody agrees on....

218
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:34,083
...and that's money.

219
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:38,083
The rest of it is just a bunch
of sentimental bullshit.

220
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,541
Is money... your god?

221
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,500
It's power. Something a lot
more useful than God.

222
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,625
And Rock, if you think
about it, other than this,

223
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,625
what do we really
value in life?

224
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,208
God? Love? Don't make me laugh.

225
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,666
Back when I was just a brat,

226
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,500
crawling around
that shit-hole city,

227
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,583
it seemed like God and
love were always sold out

228
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,666
when I went looking.

229
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,125
Before I knew better,

230
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,833
I clung to God and prayed
to him every single night.

231
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,750
Yeah, I believed in God
right up until that night

232
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,458
the cops beat the hell
outta me for no reason at all.

233
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,958
All they saw when
they looked at me

234
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,291
was another little ghetto rat
with no power and no god.

235
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:29,791
What's left for a poor little
Chinese bitch to rely on?

236
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:33,916
It's money, of course.
And guns. Fuckin' eh.

237
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,250
With these two things,
the world's a great place.

238
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,208
I wish I hadn't
heard that. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,750
[REVY] Fuck you.

240
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,333
If I was looking for pity,

241
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,875
I would have told you
something a lot more colorful.

242
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,250
The moral of the story is
when you're living on the edge,

243
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,666
that's all that matters to you

244
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,000
'cause that's all
you've really got.

245
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,208
Not everyone can get off
on being normal, Rock.

246
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,541
And one more thing...

247
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:06,000
All those rich, fat bastards
living under palm trees

248
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,875
and bitches who think
that life's only about

249
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,708
putting on makeup...

250
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,333
I don't wanna hear you
speaking your mind

251
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,708
from the same perspective
as those hypocrites.

252
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,916
Nothing's worse than being
treated like some whore

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,875
by your companions.

254
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:24,791
I'll say this once--

255
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,208
the next time you decide you're
gonna tell me what's proper, 

256
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,666
you'll no longer be one of us.

257
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,500
When that happens...

258
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,833
...I'm gonna kill you.

259
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:39,916
[ROCK] Right. I understand.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,333
[explosion]

261
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,958
Revy, what was that?

262
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,500
Shh.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,416
[ROCK] Revy!

264
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,458
Go somewhere where bullets
won't find you and keep quiet.

265
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,250
The only ones who'd be
knocking on that door

266
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,541
are either ghosts or crooks.

267
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,833
And since the ghosts
are already down here,

268
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:05,875
well, we must have
some troublemakers here.

269
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,458
But we left our gear
on the other side

270
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,375
and there's only one way there.

271
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:18,416
[footsteps]

272
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,083
If we can't get through,
there's no escape.

273
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,500
One.

274
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,041
Two.

275
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,166
And there's more.

276
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,541
Enough. You're not helping.

277
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,041
You've got a lot to learn,
you know that?

278
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:38,125
What you need to listen for
are the guns on their belts.

279
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,375
What now?

280
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,416
[REVY] "What now"?
Well, that's obvious.

281
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,125
We kill 'em all!

282
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,458
Rock, get our tanks!

283
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:54,166
Looks like we got company.
A couple of grave robbers.

284
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,625
John! To the other side!

285
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,458
Hey, Rock! Get down!

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,083
[ROCK] Damn it! The painting!

287
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,041
This is it! Brunhilda!

288
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,750
Alright, we've got it!
Cover me! I'm off!

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,041
They got the painting!

290
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,208
Yeah, they won't
get away so easy.

291
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,750
[KRUPPEN FELLER]
Disconnect the pod.

292
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,875
[STREIFFER] But Richert and the
others are still down there!

293
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,125
Forget them.

294
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,500
As far as I'm concerned,
they're dead. Hurry up!

295
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,958
Move your ass, Rock!
We need to get our gear!

296
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,583
The beacons are on.

297
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,166
--Where are they?
--Directly above the sub.

298
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,791
What the hell are they doing?

299
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,750
Can you tell me
where they're headed?

300
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,750
Their position isn't changing.
They're going straight up

301
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,916
towards the Nazi mother ship.

302
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,458
We have the painting,
I'm looking at it right now.

303
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,083
[RACHMANN] You've done well!

304
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,250
[men cheering]

305
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,833
However, we weren't alone.

306
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,083
Tell me she's not gonna do it.

307
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,750
Neither of 'em know
who they're up against.

308
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,875
She's probably planning to...

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,875
Damn it! We're talking
about fanatics

310
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,583
who launch anti-tank
missles without any warning.

311
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,000
Revy's current equipment
isn't gonna help her.

312
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,750
If she surfaces
without realizing...

313
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,458
...it's over for her.

314
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,625
[DUTCH] We'll stay put.
It's too soon.

315
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,750
[BENNY] But Dutch...

316
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,000
[DUTCH] You wanna
show some bravado,

317
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,041
charge in and all
go to hell together?

318
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,166
It may paint a great picture,

319
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,458
but it won't be much
of an ending, boy.

320
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,375
For now, you should just pray

321
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,958
that it's not
Revy's time to go yet.

322
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,625
The enemy is coming up.

323
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,791
The grave robber's
are coming up!

324
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,000
Stand by on the machine gun!

325
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,541
Fire!

326
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,083
[DUTCH] They started.

327
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,666
You think they're alright?

328
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,583
[DUTCH] If they're
still shooting,

329
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,833
it means they're not dead yet.

330
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,416
They've stopped.

331
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,583
[BENNY] Looks that way.

332
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,958
Yeah! We got those bastards!

333
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
You idiots.
It was your misfortune

334
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,000
to have touched our
glorious inheritance

335
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,791
with your unworthy hands.

336
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,375
Regret it at the
bottom of the sea.

337
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,958
Retrieve the pod.
We're leaving this area.

338
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,750
[BENNY] The beacons
are still active.

339
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,791
They're drifting southeast
away from the ship.

340
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,833
But I've got no way of knowing
if they're dead or alive.

341
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,708
Can you hear me up there, Dutch?

342
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:05,583
[DUTCH] Yeah. Their ship
is starting to move.

343
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,208
[BENNY] Shall we go
and pick up some bones?

344
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,708
[DUTCH] That's a bit
too much, Benny-boy.

345
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,291
I guess my nerves
aren't as tough as yours.

346
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,916
[DUTCH] Yeah, I know.

347
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,500
[ROCK] Revy, look.
There's our boat.

348
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,291
So, they got away
with the goods.

349
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,041
Who the hell are they, anyway?
Those bald cocksuckers!

350
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,083
They're neo-Nazis.

351
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,625
A sorry bunch of leftovers from
the Dark Ages, if you ask me.

352
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,875
But I don't know
where they're from.

353
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,666
To hell with this bullshit!

354
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,916
You're telling me
fucking skinheads

355
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,958
got one over on us?

356
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,750
[DUTCH] This is far
from over, Revy.

357
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,416
We took a job and
it's not done yet.

358
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,041
Let's do this, Dutch!

359
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,708
Let's turn that Nazi boat
into a floating morgue!

360
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,916
[DUTCH] Agreed.

361
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,875
Putting all politics aside,

362
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,958
it's not good for business
to leave it at this.

363
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,125
The only cure for these
idiots playing heroes

364
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,833
is some bitter medicine.

365
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,875
So, let's give it to 'em.

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,958
[REVY] Listen, Dutch,
I just can't.

367
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,208
I can't partner...
with that guy.
