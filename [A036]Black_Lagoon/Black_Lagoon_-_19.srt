00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,208
[alarm]

2
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,583
[ROCK] Over the past year,

3
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,541
I've woken up with hangovers
in a lot of places.

4
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:13,958
Let's see... Sometimes it's
the cabin of the torpedo boat.

5
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,166
Sometimes the office
of a delivery company.

6
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,375
But usually,
this is the place.

7
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,750
A cheap hotel room overlooking
downtown Roanapur.

8
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,041
For the first time in a year,

9
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,833
I'm leaving this
city to go far away.

10
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:29,291
To a place that
I used to call home.

11
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:32,875
That's where I'm headed.

12
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,958
[BENNY] Oh, that you, Rock?

13
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,375
Happy New Year!

14
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,166
Although, it's pretty hard
to get in the mood here

15
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,333
when no one's celebrating.

16
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,583
Uh-huh, just a couple
of firecrackers.

17
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,333
[ROCK] Yeah? Well, they've got
everything nicely decorated

18
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,916
for the New Year here.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,083
[BENNY] And how's Revy doing?

20
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,666
[ROCK] So far,
all she does is complain.

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,666
She didn't like the
Tokarev she was given.

22
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,208
She was in a bad mood all
day yesterday 'cause of that.

23
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,708
[BENNY] You're quite
the ladies man,

24
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:09,375
You know she only went 'cause
she was worried about you.

25
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,750
[ROCK] Yeah.
I'd better get going.

26
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,416
I'll talk to you soon.

27
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,875
[REVY] Look. It started snowing.

28
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,166
They definitely get a lot less
snow here than in New York.

29
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,750
But just seeing it
again reminds me.

30
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,291
Last time I saw snow,
I was still living there.

31
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,541
That was ages ago.

32
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,791
So, whaddya think?

33
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:32,083
I've been hit on by
a few guys already.

34
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,333
When I say something, they
look at me like I'm retarded

35
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:36,041
and say " <i>Gaijin, gaijin.</i> "

36
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,875
This country pisses me off.

37
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:45,375
[BANDO speaking in Japanese]

38
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,125
How should he address you?

39
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,083
Just Balalaika is fine.

40
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,000
I've been briefed by Laptev.

41
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,333
We've been eager to set up

42
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:01,500
base of operations in
Tokyo for quite some time.

43
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,416
So, your assistance
is greatly appreciated.

44
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:11,250
[BANDO speaking in Japanese]

45
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,416
But isn't the Washimine Family
part of the council?

46
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,416
[ROCK translating]
We can only go so far

47
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,625
in meeting the
council's call to duty.

48
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,666
We've gone to great lengths

49
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,083
to fulfill our
obligation to them.

50
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,333
But they continue
to disrespect us

51
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:47,041
by keeping us at the
bottom of the family ranks.

52
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:48,458
It would appear
that our interests

53
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,750
are mutually
beneficial, Mr. Bando.

54
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,791
You wish to expand your
influence with our help.

55
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:57,541
And of course, we wish
to establish ourselves

56
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:59,333
in this city.

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,250
[speaking in Japanese]

58
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:15,791
[BALALAIKA] That's funny.

59
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,083
You're concerned
about our forces?

60
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,000
Let me assure you,
our forces are nothing

61
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
like those in this country.

62
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:25,458
In essence, we're a
military force, Mr. Bando.

63
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,083
Let me show you.

64
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,375
[cellphone ringing]

65
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,333
It's me. Case eight ready?

66
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,375
Very well.

67
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,750
[speaking in Japanese]

68
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,041
Unit 5-5. Finish the job.

69
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,666
[explosion]

70
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,041
[screams from crowd]

71
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:53,375
[ROCK speaking in Japanese]

72
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,083
[speaking in Japanese]

73
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,791
[BALALAIKA] Intimidation with
handguns will amount to nothing.

74
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,750
We've opted to make
our strength known

75
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,291
with the first strike.

76
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,125
This is what we
of Hotel Moscow

77
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,958
consider a true
show of force.

78
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,541
We will not hesitate to destroy

79
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,916
that which stands in our way,
do you understand?

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,458
That means decimating
anything and anyone.

81
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:22,500
[speaking in Japanese]

82
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,875
[REVY] Those yakuza
were scared shitless.

83
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,833
I don't think they make
women like Balalaika in Japan.

84
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,541
This isn't quite the
homecoming I'd expected.

85
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,916
I'd rather they didn't turn
my country into a war zone.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,083
Old Fry Face was in
a pretty good mood.

87
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,833
There hasn't been a
big fight in Roanapur

88
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,708
for a while now, so she's
probably itching for it.

89
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,958
I'm telling you, she
gets off on this shit.

90
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,083
She'd give up sex before
she passed up a war.

91
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,458
[ROCK] Something's
wrong with her.

92
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,208
All of them are war maniacs.

93
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,291
I'm guessing they left
a few important screws

94
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,166
back in Afghanistan.

95
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,250
Uh... Hey, Rock.

96
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,375
What is that?

97
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,541
Oh. It's a neighborhood fair.

98
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:01,500
It's almost the New Year.

99
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:02,958
So, it's like a carnival.

100
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,416
Sounds like a good
time. Yo, driver!

101
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,166
[DRIVER] Alright. Here you go.

102
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,416
Hey, Rock, where the fuck
are all the rides?

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,916
[ROCK] You won't find any at
a traditional Japanese fair.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,041
[REVY grumbling]

105
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,208
Here you go.

106
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,416
[REVY] Yeah,
that's my third one!

107
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,541
Well, I suppose they don't

108
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,208
call you Two-Hands
for nothing, right?

109
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,166
Got that right.

110
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,708
As if you ever had any doubts.

111
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,041
I'm Miss Rebecca.

112
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:30,875
Give me a gun and I'll
show you why they call me

113
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,916
the best shot in the East.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,541
Number four.

115
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,291
It's too bad I don't
have my Cutlass.

116
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,083
I could close this shop
down in three seconds.

117
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,750
Of course, it's next
to fuckin' impossible

118
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,458
to have a gunfight
in this country.

119
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,625
And you can't bribe the cops
like you can in Roanapur.

120
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,041
If we get thrown in jail...

121
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,000
You remembering something?

122
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,166
Huh? Like what?

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,791
[REVY] What do you mean,
"Like what?"

124
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,416
This is where
you're from, isn't it?

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,458
Don't you have anyone here?

126
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,583
You know. Like
family or someone.

127
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:08,458
It's not like you were born from
the crotch of a tree, right?

128
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:11,166
[ROCK] I thought nosy types
weren't too popular.

129
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,500
[REVY] It's nothing.

130
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,625
Just wondering what you
were thinking, that's all.

131
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,333
You looked like you were lost
in thought for a second there.

132
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,083
[ROCK] I still remember the day
you first pulled a gun on me.

133
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,458
One year ago. Time flies.

134
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:24,875
[REVY] Yeah.

135
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,250
I don't understand it.

136
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,541
I used to know this
place so well, but

137
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,708
now I feel like I don't
know it at all anymore.

138
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:36,208
My... family doesn't
exactly get along.

139
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,083
My older brother turned out well
and got a government job.

140
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,875
But I got into college a year
late and that was that.

141
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,416
They didn't expect much.

142
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,291
In the end, I guess
they didn't really care.

143
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,375
[REVY] But your folks
are alive, right?

144
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,291
You should at least
get in touch with them.

145
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,125
I mean, c'mon, you
haven't been arrested yet.

146
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,541
Could be your last chance.

147
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,583
In our line of work,
it's only a matter of time.

148
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,875
From my point of view,
your family is normal.

149
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,208
Isn't it worth it to
at least go visit them?

150
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,875
I mean, you've
managed to get this far

151
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,000
without stealing or
killing anyone, right?

152
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,916
Look, don't get me wrong.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,875
I'm just saying you
might regret it...

154
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,250
...if you don't
go and see 'em.

155
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,750
I can't say that
I'm really normal.

156
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,583
The fact that I'm hanging
around with you guys

157
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,125
should be proof of that.

158
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,750
[chuckles]

159
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,083
What is it?

160
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:36,458
[REVY] Alright! One more shot
and I get the grand prize!

161
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,041
What the fuck?!

162
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,208
This thing must
be weighted down!

163
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,750
[ROCK] What're you doing?!

164
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,583
Yeah!

165
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:46,875
Tell him, Rock!

166
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,500
Huh?

167
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,833
Excuse me, my friend there
just got your top score,

168
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,375
and she'd like to
collect her prize now.

169
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,458
No way. She doesn't get
a prize for cheating.

170
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,708
He says it doesn't count

171
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,666
because you used your
gun to knock it down.

172
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,958
Fucking asshole!

173
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,666
Hey, that's bullshit!

174
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,791
You won't get away with
this, you cocksucker!

175
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,041
Get out of my face,
you arrogant Yankee bitch!

176
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,291
What was that?!

177
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,791
Maybe I should use real
bullets instead, huh?!

178
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,416
[ROCK] C'mon, Revy!
Just let it go!

179
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,750
[REVY] Shut up!

180
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,833
I gotta teach this cocksucker
a fuckin' lesson!

181
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,000
[MAN] Typical American!

182
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,833
Come to my country
and tell me what to do?!

183
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,958
--Ginji.
--[REVY] Rotten son of a bitch!

184
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:23,583
Excuse me.

185
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,041
May I have a word?

186
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,291
[REVY] Huh?!

187
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,083
We're in the middle of
New Year's celebrations.

188
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:32,041
Why don't we all
just try to have fun?

189
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,333
Please, miss.

190
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,000
I urge you to lay
your aggression aside.

191
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,208
And who the fuck are you?!

192
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,416
Revy, let's go!
We're being a nuisance.

193
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,125
It sounds like you're
taking his side, Rock.

194
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,208
[GINJI] If you're going
to be unreasonable,

195
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,791
we have a problem.

196
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,916
However, the way
I see it, life is short,

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,500
so why don't we all
just try to enjoy

198
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,041
what little time we're given?

199
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,833
Listen to me.
You've had your fun,

200
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,291
so please take advantage of
this opportunity to save face.

201
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,583
Hmph! Fuck that!

202
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,166
[ROCK] Revy! Just let it go!

203
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,083
It's not worth it!

204
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,791
[YUKIO] Um...

205
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,083
Sweet sake...

206
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,083
Huh?

207
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,416
I, um... Sweet sake, anyone?

208
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,666
It's just so cold tonight,

209
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,916
I thought rather
than standing out...

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,416
Who the fuck are you?

211
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,583
But, miss...

212
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,333
[ROCK] Yes, I agree
with the young lady.

213
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,125
I'm not a big
fan of fighting,

214
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,541
so sake it is. Alright?

215
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,000
[REVY] Um, how the fuck
did we end up like this?

216
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,541
[ROCK] It's not so bad.

217
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,833
Besides, there's nothing to
gain from making a big scene.

218
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,041
Shit, I'm not even
in the mood anymore.

219
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,333
The buzz is gone.

220
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,375
Well, thank god for that.

221
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:45,583
I'm really glad that
you accepted my offer

222
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,458
before things escalated.

223
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,291
--Ah, well,
--Ah, well,

224
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,333
--I, uh...
--I, uh...

225
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,625
Oh, you were
saying something?

226
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,666
Sorry. Go ahead. I didn't
mean to cut you off.

227
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,583
I was just...

228
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,500
I was just... gonna say
you look like a student.

229
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,208
Or maybe you're
one of the vendors?

230
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,375
Oh?

231
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,541
Well, yes. Actually, I'm both.

232
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,250
You see, my father was, um...

233
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,625
My father was
actually a vendor.

234
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,541
And that man, Mr. Ginji,

235
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,333
well, my father was
pretty much his mentor.

236
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,791
If there's ever any kind
of a dispute around here,

237
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,291
everyone goes to Ginji.

238
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,541
He's big, huh?

239
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,083
Anyway, before
he realized it,

240
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,958
Ginji had become the
arbitrator of Takamachi.

241
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,291
Is that so?

242
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,250
I came here after
my cram school tonight

243
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,583
to help Ginji close up shop.

244
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,125
So, this was quite a shock.

245
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,208
I bet. I'm afraid she can
be pretty short-tempered.

246
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,833
I'm just glad everything
turned out okay.

247
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:37,833
I'm curious...

248
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,958
Your friend,
is she... Japanese?

249
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,125
No, she's from the States.

250
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,708
She's Chinese-American.

251
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,791
How should I put it...

252
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,208
Uh... we work for
the same company.

253
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,916
I'm here to translate
for a Russian.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,375
She came with me.

255
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,750
Wow, an international
career! Impressive.

256
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,416
I dunno about that.

257
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,166
The company's small
and it can be quite stressful.

258
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,458
It's hard work
and often dangerous.

259
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,166
Your job is dangerous?

260
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,125
Ah, well, um...

261
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,625
Yeah, something like that.

262
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,208
Tch! If they keep this up,
I'm gonna puke.

263
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,000
[chuckles]

264
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,375
What are you
laughing at, asshole?

265
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,708
[GINJI] Miss.

266
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,666
You're not a decent
woman, are you?

267
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,708
There. It's those eyes.

268
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,875
Those aren't the
eyes of a human being.

269
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,833
Those are the
eyes of a rabid dog.

270
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,541
[REVY] Ha! Well, there's one
I've never heard before,

271
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,625
but all the same,
I get your point.

272
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,375
You and I are the same type.

273
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,625
You stink of blood and guts.

274
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,500
No mistaking it.

275
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,750
Damn, it's starting
to get cold.

276
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,791
Well, Miss, I think
it's time I got you home.

277
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,458
Okay.

278
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,041
Goodbye.

279
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,083
[ROCK] And that was how we met.

280
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:56,541
Oh, by the way,
what's your name?

281
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,416
[YUKIO] Right. It's Yukio.

282
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
It was a pleasure talking
to you. Take care!

283
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,583
[ROCK] That day...

284
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,833
...I still didn't know
just how powerful

285
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,375
the pull of the
underworld can be.

286
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,041
But I'd learn.

287
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,166
[BORIS] 0230 hours.

288
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,333
We've assaulted
a Kousa Clan office.

289
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,541
Confirmed outcome.

290
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,916
Twelve kills, no fatalities,
no casualties.

291
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,208
All men left the
scene by 0237 hours.

292
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,208
Shall I have them prepare some
Russian tea instead, Ma'am?

293
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,833
[BALALAIKA] No, I don't
like to make a fuss.

294
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:38,916
Some toast, perhaps?

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,833
Would you like
toast, Sergeant?

296
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,583
No, I don't have
any appetite.

297
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,000
You know you shouldn't
skip breakfast, Sergeant.

298
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:47,291
It's not healthy.

299
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:48,833
And when did
the police arrive?

300
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:52,125
[BORIS] They closed off the
scene at exactly 0305 hours.

301
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,333
They're now on a heightened
security status.

302
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,083
I had the Washimine
Clan transcribe

303
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,833
their wireless
communications.

304
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,416
We'll have to wait
for Rock's translation

305
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,458
before we can
confirm any details.

306
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,208
The reliability
of this information

307
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,166
could very well mean
life or death for us.

308
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,458
Right.

309
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:09,541
[LAPTEV] Heh. You don't
disappoint, Balalaika.

310
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,708
I'm starting to understand

311
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,625
why Boss Slevenin
speaks so highly of you.

312
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,041
Is that so?

313
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,958
And whose ass do you think
I'm here to wipe, Vasily?

314
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,875
You've single-handedly
destroyed our reputation here.

315
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,083
This place is a playground,

316
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,083
but you still
couldn't take control.

317
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:27,375
I want to wrap up this operation
and get back to Roanapur.

318
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,250
That place is a
real powder keg.

319
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,291
I can't leave it
unattended for long.

320
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,250
I'll be seeing
you in six hours.

321
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,666
[LAPTEV] You forget yourself!

322
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,750
Back in Moscow, I'm one of
the highest-ranked bosses,

323
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,750
so show a little respect!

324
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,916
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,458
It's hard for me to
remember the bosses

326
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,291
who rose up using
money instead of skill.

327
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,833
I'd better write your
name on a dollar bill

328
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,541
so I don't forget
who you are.

329
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:52,416
[LAPTEV] Apologize!
You lousy ex-military bitch!

330
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,375
[BALALAIKA] Let me explain
something to you.

331
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,791
There are two things in this
world that I just cannot stand.

332
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:04,291
One is cold blintzes
and the other is useless,

333
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,708
incompetent,
ex-KGB shitheads.

334
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,291
Now I suggest you
keep your head low

335
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,375
so the bullets don't hit you.

336
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,791
Hey, Boss.

337
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,875
[BANDO] You know what, Ginji?

338
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,250
The new generation would
rather plug into video games

339
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:36,958
than play with these.

340
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:40,083
How much longer are you
planning to endure this life?

341
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,708
[GINJI] For better or for worse,
this is the job of a vendor.

342
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,250
With all due respect, Boss,

343
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,458
it's a lot better than selling
meth and women for a living.

344
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,708
[BANDO] Are you implying that
I do this because I like it?

345
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:55,083
You think I wanted this?

346
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,458
When the old man died,

347
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,166
he left us with a family
that can barely get tribute.

348
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,041
Truth is the only reason this
clan still exists in this city,

349
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,708
is because the old man and
the Kousa Clan's last head

350
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:09,041
were sworn brothers.

351
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,291
Now that they're gone,
what have we got?

352
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,458
It's been almost
three years now

353
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,666
and they still won't
let us name a successor.

354
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,708
We're the only ones left who're
still loyal to the old man.

355
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,041
He took me in
and got me set up

356
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,750
when I came over
here from Kansai.

357
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:29,666
That's why I'm here. It falls
to us to do something.

358
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,250
Ginji. You said that
dealing with low-lifes

359
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,500
brought shame upon the yakuza.

360
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,541
However, that only
matters if we have a name.

361
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,833
That's not what the
old man would've said.

362
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,500
I'm pulling off
a big job right now.

363
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,625
I've enlisted the
help of the Russians

364
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,166
to take care of the council.

365
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,000
[GINJI] Do you realize
what you're saying?

366
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,833
They tried to take us
out first, didn't they?!

367
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,458
All the same,
Russians are Russians

368
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,958
no matter who they are.

369
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,791
It goes without saying, they
don't have a shred of honor.

370
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,083
Which is why we need
to maintain control

371
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:08,125
of certain key areas.

372
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,208
[GINJI] So, what are
you trying to say?

373
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,958
[BANDO] Ginji, I need you
to take it up again.

374
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,041
That famous
white scabbard.

375
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
Only one name
still strikes fear

376
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,458
into the hearts of all yakuza.

377
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,041
"Man-slayer Ginji."

378
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,583
I beg you, take up the
sword this one last time.

379
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,708
Look, Boss...
I'm indebted to you

380
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,458
for looking after the
young lady as you have.

381
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll never forget that.

382
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:37,125
I also understand what
you're saying. But...

383
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,291
You cannot look
me in the eye

384
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,541
and tell me there
is any honor in this.

385
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,791
Back when I took up the white
scabbard for the old man,

386
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,375
it was because he had honor.

387
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,916
[BANDO] I guess that's that.
I'll see you later.

388
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,375
[GINJI] Those Russians...

389
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,708
Hmm?

390
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,000
[GINJI] Did they bring
their own interpreter?

391
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,250
Yeah, but why do you ask?

392
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,708
What did you make of him?

393
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,125
I dunno. Well-mannered
young kid.

394
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,250
Had a girl with him
who looked like trouble.

395
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,166
He looked just like
an average guy.

396
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,791
There was something
about him, though.

397
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,541
If I had to
make an analogy,

398
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,291
he's kinda like the chicken
that shows up at your doorstep,

399
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,833
carrying soup stock, onions,

400
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,375
and even the pot
to cook himself in.

401
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,250
Uh, this shouldn't
take too long, okay.

402
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,625
--[REVY] Mhm.
--[ROCK] See ya.

403
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,041
Shoo. Hurry up and go.
Shoo, shoo.

404
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll be waiting
here for you,

405
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,666
but not forever.

406
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,541
Just until I finish
drinking this.

407
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:37,791
After that, I'm leaving...
partner.

408
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,250
[dog barking]

409
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,666
--I got you!
--Got you first!

410
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,208
No, you're dead!

411
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,958
Whaddya know.

412
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,750
The sky looks the same
no matter where you are.

413
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,291
Whether it's here
or back on Mott Street.

414
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,250
Hey! You goddamn brats!

415
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,000
You wanna shoot each
other in the streets,

416
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,291
then why don't you
head on over to Lebanon!

417
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,000
What do we have here?
You're a real gunman, are you?

418
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,708
But just look at this
sorry excuse for a gun.

419
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,250
Okay, you brats!

420
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,833
Keep your eyes on those cans
we got lined up there, alright?

421
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,250
Bang! Bang! Bang!

422
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,666
Holy cow!

423
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,958
--[BOY 1] She got 'em all!
--[BOY 2] That was sweet!

424
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:19,250
That's right.
Just like Annie Oakley.

425
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:22,000
Jack McCall! I'm here
to avenge Wild Bill!

426
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,375
Can you outdraw
Calamity Jane?

427
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,291
Go on. Take your best shot.

428
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,541
Ah! Ya got me!

429
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,500
[BOY 3] I've been hit!

430
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,541
Whoa, whoa.
What was that?!

431
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,916
Sorry, but you've got
this dying thing all wrong.

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,750
Only place you'll see people
go down like that is in movies.

433
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,458
In reality, you just suddenly
lose all your strength.

434
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,791
Do ya understand?

435
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,000
It's like everything below
your knees disappears,

436
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,958
then you lose balance
and go down head-first.

437
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,250
I'll show you what I mean.

438
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,333
You there.

439
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:56,875
Ahhh!

440
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:14,125
Lady, if that's what it's
like to die, it kinda sucks.

441
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,666
I'm sorry, but that's
just how it is when you die.

442
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,541
In real life, dying
never looks that coo--

443
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,875
What are you doing?

444
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,375
How long have
you been watching?

445
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:27,041
Since about the time you charged
into the Deadwood Saloon.

446
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,083
That's a different ending
from what I remember.

447
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,583
Calamity Jane didn't die
at that exact location.

448
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,250
Goddamn it, Rock.

449
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:37,125
Hey, that's my gun!

450
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,583
[REVY] Listen up! If you tell
Dutch or Benny about this,

451
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,291
I swear to God,
I'll cut your balls off

452
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,500
and feed them to you on
the end of a fuckin' skewer!

453
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,208
[ROCK] Okay!
I won't say a thing!

454
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,375
So, were you able to
meet up with your folks?

455
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:53,208
Oh. W-Well, I did end
up going to the house,

456
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,625
but... I didn't see them.

457
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,083
There was no one there.

458
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:58,833
[REVY chuckles]

459
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,083
What is it?

460
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,791
[REVY] Nah, it's nothing.

461
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:05,291
Anyway, we're still here
for a few more days.

462
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:07,750
[ROCK] Hm. You're right.

463
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:11,708
[REVY] I don't get it.
Why won't he just go home?

464
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:15,500
It's like this place is made
for him. He belongs here.

465
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,791
[kids laughing]

466
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,291
[YOSHIDA] Boss! The Russians are
going completely crazy on us!

467
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:55,250
They've gone and blown
something else up today!
