1
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,416
[ROCK] At the entrance to
the gulf, a Buddha statue,

2
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,416
once meant to brighten the
world with a light of virtue,

3
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,208
now sits decaying.

4
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,125
Beyond its faded
glory lies Roanapur,

5
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,000
the city of immorality.

6
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,083
From the overland
entrance to the city,

7
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,250
there's always a
noose left hanging,

8
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,291
intended for some
unknown person.

9
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,333
And what awaits
past the scenery

10
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:43,500
is the city of pleasure,
Roanapur.

11
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,541
Until recently, I was
a businessman in Tokyo.

12
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,416
Now I'm a crew member
on a pirate ship.

13
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:05,791
I'll kill you! I'll kill
you! Hey, you. Bastard!

14
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,250
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

15
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:12,041
You're not getting away! Die,
bastard! Kill you! Kill you!

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,916
[DUTCH] Revy, I'm stepping
out for a while.

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,250
[REVY] Gotcha. Watch your back.

18
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,458
--You going out?
--Yeah, for a bit.

19
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,000
[spitting]

20
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,583
What the hell is this?

21
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,666
[bell]

22
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,208
--[ROCK] Revy?
--Hm?

23
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,458
Just saw Dutch.
Where's he going?

24
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,208
Who knows?

25
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,708
Besides, it's none
of our business

26
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,083
what Dutch does
in his spare time.

27
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,541
You're right. I only asked
because I was curious.

28
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,500
Nosy types aren't too popular.

29
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:07,333
What the hell is this? Tastes
like it came out of your ass.

30
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,583
Whatever you paid for those,
you got ripped off.

31
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,208
Guess so. It looks like
things don't get any better

32
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,916
when you go downtown,
either. Not in this city.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,458
You gotta realize international
criminals come here

34
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,250
to lock horns with each other.

35
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:25,000
They're all trying to scam
one another from top to bottom.

36
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,458
You don't really stand a
chance of surviving here

37
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,958
if you always believe
everything you see.

38
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,333
Then again,

39
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,416
you're lucky if that's
the biggest problem you got.

40
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,541
I'll take it to heart.

41
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:39,250
She's right. I may
still be too soft.

42
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,916
After all, I don't know the
histories of my crew members.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,083
They keep their
pasts to themselves,

44
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:48,708
their privacy protected by a
fierce sense of independence.

45
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:52,041
But I don't care.
That's how I feel.

46
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:58,166
Hello there. It's me.
So, how you doing?

47
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,583
Yeah, go ahead.

48
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:05,750
International number
10013. Right.

49
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:09,500
Send me 120,000 to the
name "Flyer's Company."

50
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,583
Yeah.
[car horn]

51
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,166
[CHIN] Hey, Dutch.

52
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,166
We'll talk later.

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,083
Fuck me.

54
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,583
Great weather, huh?

55
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:24,000
So, how's business going
for you guys? Good, I hope.

56
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:28,166
Can't complain, Mr. Chin.
We're getting by.

57
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,125
Well, that's great to hear.

58
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,666
Tell me something--
how long do you plan

59
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,166
to work with that
Fry Face bitch, anyway?

60
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,916
Maybe you're just not
thinking straight, eh?

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,291
Don't know, Mr. Chin. No clue
what you're talking about.

62
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,708
I'm talking about
that crazy Russian.

63
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,833
Ever since those damn
Russkies got here,

64
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:50,708
we've been losing
money left and right.

65
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,000
That Ivan's taken
all of our girls,

66
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:56,208
the rights to our hotels,
and the heroin routes.

67
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,291
They've got no sense of honor.

68
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:01,541
And if we end up losing
the sea routes to them too,

69
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,958
those greedy bastards are going
to wipe us out completely.

70
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,416
Allow me to spell
it out for you--

71
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,375
what I'm trying to say is you
should pull out--and quickly.

72
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,166
Hey, listen. Let me
give you some advice.

73
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,583
Hm?

74
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:22,208
[DUTCH] Even bad guys have
common sense, you hear me?

75
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,208
When you went and sold that
junk to the New People's Army,

76
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,416
we were the ones
hired to deliver it.

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,666
It wasn't even close to
a "no problem" situation,

78
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,666
but why don't you remind
me who pulled out then?

79
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,041
Why don't you let
that go, huh, Dutch?

80
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,791
It's behind us, so don't
bring up the past

81
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,208
like some old bitch.

82
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:43,333
I'll say what I want.
And I'll tell you this much--

83
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,125
Balalaika has a hell of a lot
more honor than you ever did.

84
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,875
If you want to do
business with us,

85
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,916
we'll ship your
goods at our rate.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,250
We're done talking now.

87
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,708
I'm telling you, you won't
get any second chances, Dutch.

88
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,625
And neither will
you, my friend.

89
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,333
Try using your head
if you want to survive.

90
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,916
Later.

91
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey, Dutch,

92
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,375
why don't you ever come
sample the goods here, baby?

93
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,875
I already know what's
inside your bottles, ladies.

94
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,875
After all, I did
ship them here.

95
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,208
Huh?

96
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,875
[DUTCH] That bastard.

97
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:34,208
[VERROCCHIO] Is it true that
torpedo boat bastard is working

98
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,500
for some country bumpkin,
Russkie bitch these days?

99
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,958
[BODYGUARD] Yes, sir.

100
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,500
But I've been hearing that
these guys will take on jobs

101
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,583
from just about anyone, so long
as they got money to spend.

102
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,166
I'll be damned if
he can find me a city

103
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,750
as rotten to the core as this.

104
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,416
[car horn]

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,958
Huh?

106
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,375
Dutch, look. The new
board's finally arrived.

107
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,791
This is the pure,
unadulterated real deal.

108
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,708
[DUTCH] You're probably the
first guy to ever use the word

109
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,916
"pure" in this city.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,625
Now hurry your ass up and get
that stuff on the boat, Benny.

111
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:06,666
Yeah, sure thing!

112
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,500
Man, oh, man. Our crew can be
so damn simpleminded sometimes.

113
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,500
Hey, Dutch.

114
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,541
[seagulls]

115
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,833
[snoring]

116
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,916
Wake up, sailor! We have a job.

117
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,041
Oh, okay. A job?

118
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,083
[engine revving]

119
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,125
Where the hell's Rock?

120
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:50,416
I told him to wash up, but he's
sure taking his sweet time.

121
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,041
Sorry to keep you waiting.

122
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
[tires peeling out]

123
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,000
[car horn]

124
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,166
What is it today?

125
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,458
Just came in. Passed on
from Donnie Yen.

126
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,000
Who's Donnie Yen?

127
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,958
[DUTCH] He gives us jobs
from time to time.

128
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,625
Today, we're receiving a package
from the Vietnamese military

129
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,250
at Phu Quoc Island.

130
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:24,916
I figured since our
schedule was open...

131
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,916
Anyway, nothing's better
than a hard day's work, right?

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,291
What are we supposed to do with
all these lame jobs, Dutch?

133
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,041
No wonder we can't
make office boy here

134
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:38,041
trade these shitty white-collar
shirts for some real clothes.

135
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,458
I wish you'd stop with that.

136
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,333
I told you,
this is just my style.

137
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,916
Which reminds me, Rock,

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,583
what happened to that Hawaiian
shirt I got you at the market?

139
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:48,208
--You know the one.
--The hideously ugly shirt?

140
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,375
Wearing that thing should
be some form of punishment.

141
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,250
[REVY] Something you
want to say, Rock?

142
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,416
You think I don't
have any taste?

143
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,166
[ROCK] Hey, stop that.

144
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,875
[CHIN] Yeah, I got it.

145
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
[phone ringing]

146
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,541
That's right. It looks like
they fell for the trap.

147
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,125
Whether you want to
see this thing through

148
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,166
is up to you at this point.

149
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
I know for a fact you've
been down on your luck lately.

150
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,666
I hear you messed
up the last time

151
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,166
and got chased around
by a battleship.

152
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,083
Huh? You take care of
this job and I guarantee

153
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,541
you'll get all the tolls
between here and Kalimantan.

154
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:31,916
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,416
That's the deal. Give that one
some thought, why don't you?

156
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,833
I told you, Dutch,

157
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,166
you're not gonna get any
second chances with us.

158
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:58,375
Take this through
here and back

159
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:04,041
and it should end up like
this. Hey, that's funny.

160
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,375
Come on.

161
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,958
You have got to be the clumsiest
person I've ever seen.

162
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:13,125
Or is it that you're
just not trying hard?

163
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,125
Sorry.

164
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,291
[REVY]
You're not cut out for this.

165
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,708
Watch my hands.

166
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,916
A retarded monkey could do it.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,250
I guess... but don't
be so hard on me.

168
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,750
I never did stuff
like this at work.

169
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:32,125
Well, Rock, what kind of
stuff <i>did</i> you do at work?

170
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,125
I was in the Materials
Procurement department.

171
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,208
I took trips, I wrote reports...

172
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,708
...made calls.

173
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,666
But I think bowing my head to
my superiors was my real job.

174
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,291
At night, I'd accompany my boss
when he'd go out for drinks.

175
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,000
I even got my ass kicked once
when he was really drunk.

176
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,500
That's really great, Rock.

177
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,333
What a disgusting story.

178
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,666
How could you put up
with all that shit?

179
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,166
What are you, some kind of
masochist or something?

180
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,375
Putting up with it
is part of the job.

181
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:09,833
I mean, no one wants to
end up on the streets.

182
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,791
Plus, that's just
how people survive.

183
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,125
Pathetic.

184
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:18,875
Revy, what did you do
before you ended up here?

185
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,041
What I do now is pretty much
what I've always done.

186
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,208
Really? Then let me guess--

187
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,500
as a kid, you spent your
days on the river near home

188
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,750
swinging a Cutlass around?

189
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:34,750
That's the truth.
I stole, I killed.

190
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,500
I did everything that
you'd consider bad.

191
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:43,041
[gun shots]

192
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,958
It ain't no sick joke.

193
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:56,000
[seagulls]

194
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,791
Dutch, I've got several
boats approaching.

195
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,833
Start praying, 'cause
you're gonna need directions

196
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,375
for how to get
to heaven, Dutch.

197
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,250
[computer beeping]

198
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,041
It doesn't make sense for there
to be any merchants around.

199
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,583
This is known as Pirate's Bay.
Can you find out who they are?

200
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:28,916
They're small and fast.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,458
Could be cops looking
to arrest pirates.

202
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,666
Dutch, a red alert!

203
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,791
[DUTCH] What the hell is this?
They blew right by yellow

204
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,833
and gave us the
red lamp already.

205
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,666
[BENNY] Their speed's 28 knots.

206
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,250
--Hey, Dutch.
--Hold on.

207
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,750
Benny will explain
the situation to you.

208
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:51,791
Wait a second... I just
saw three more boats.

209
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,625
There's a total
of six boats now.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
The first three
started accelerating

211
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:59,500
from the other side of
the island we just passed.

212
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,458
And these last three on our
portside came from behind

213
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,958
a completely different island.

214
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,083
Changing course
portside is dangerous.

215
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,708
The ships on that
side will catch us,

216
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,208
but it's the same
problem to starboard.

217
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,416
[DUTCH] The basic
hunting pattern.

218
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,916
[BENNY] These guys
are hauling ass, too.

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
--[REVY] Hey, Dutch.
--Yeah.

220
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,166
[REVY] I smell it.

221
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,000
[DUTCH] So, who are they?

222
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,666
I know that stench,
even from this distance.

223
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,916
These guys definitely aren't
marine cops, that's for sure.

224
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's no doubt in my mind.

225
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:31,291
They stink too much of
blood and smoke for that.

226
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,500
Pirates? We're actually
being targeted by pirates?

227
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,666
Dutch, what's the
background on our client?

228
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,375
Rock, that observation
really hurts.

229
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,916
I've been conducting
background checks

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,958
on Donnie Yen's economic
situation from the beginning.

231
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,958
[LUAK] Hello? Hello,
can you hear me, Lagoon?

232
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:50,833
That's right, it's me.

233
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,208
Dutch, it's been a while.

234
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:55,916
Now I see. It's Luak.

235
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,833
Sorry, but there's
no prey here.

236
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,083
You should go home
before you get lost.

237
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,416
There's prey right here, Dutch.

238
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,875
A ratty old torpedo boat.

239
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,125
Six vessels in pursuit.
If it is Luak,

240
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,875
he's brought
everything he's got.

241
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:11,333
Damn all these stupid bastards.

242
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,750
Chin got you involved
in this, didn't he, Luak?

243
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,458
God must pity you
for your stupidity.

244
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,208
[LUAK] Ha! Once we get
a pint of lead in you,

245
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:23,291
maybe it'll put an end to
all that pillow talk of yours.

246
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,125
The enemy's got us
on both sides,

247
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,500
but in these positions,
I think they're...

248
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,791
I see that, Rock.
I suggest you get inside.

249
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,083
Nice job.

250
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,875
If you're gonna flank the
enemy, it's common sense

251
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,000
to stagger your positions
to avoid friendly fire.

252
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,458
Amateurs.

253
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,333
[LUAK] Bastard!

254
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:55,083
Don't get too confident.

255
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,791
I'll send you straight to hell.

256
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,666
Still four vessels remaining.
Dutch, they're coming.

257
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,041
Revy, it's your turn.
Give 'em a taste of Two-Hands.

258
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,791
[REVY] Leave it to me.

259
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,541
[DUTCH] It's showtime.
Can you make them dance?

260
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,208
[REVY] You know I can.

261
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,333
[ROCK] Revy, what are
you planning to do?

262
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,291
Listen, why don't
you take a break

263
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,125
from all the casual
conversation about your world?

264
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,625
'Cause right now, I need
to focus on this world.

265
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,833
Benny-boy, we've got
two closing portside

266
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,833
and another two starboard
astern. Is that about right?

267
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,291
[BENNY] And one more.
Directly behind us.

268
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,958
[DUTCH] Do that one last, Revy.

269
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,833
[REVY] Alright. I'll start
with the shit on the left.

270
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,958
Let's dance the Jitterbug, baby!

271
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,000
How'd she...?

272
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,125
She's on the next boat!

273
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,833
Do something about that bitch.

274
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,791
[PIRATE 3] Damn, I can't
see with all the smoke.

275
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,625
[PIRATE 4] Make sure you
don't hit one of ours.

276
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,583
Damn it.

277
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,833
[PIRATE 2] Kill that bitch.
Finish her off!

278
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,500
Shit!

279
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:29,041
So, Rock, which boat is she on?

280
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,666
[ROCK] She's working
on her fifth now.

281
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,875
Hold on, looks like
the third is still alive.

282
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,250
[LUAK] There she is right
there! Shoot her! Kill her!

283
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,416
Damn it. My fleet.

284
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
She took out all my boats!

285
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,125
[DUTCH] You just hit a dead end.

286
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,625
It seems like you were
the one destined

287
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,041
to dance the Cha-Cha
with some hot lead, Luak.

288
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,833
Damn it. How dare you!

289
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,708
That bitch isn't even human.

290
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:14,833
Chin can kiss my ass.

291
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,875
I'm not dealing with
these demons anymore.

292
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:28,791
She defeated them all
single-handedly. Incredible.

293
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,958
Even as I was saying the words,

294
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:35,708
a completely different
thought had crossed my mind.

295
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,041
I can't even imagine how
her life was shattered

296
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,916
to make her who she is today.

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,708
But I must be pretty broken
myself to sit here in awe,

298
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,541
praising her for her
powers of destruction.

299
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:53,416
[CHIN] Damn it! Luak, you
useless bastard. You screwed me.

300
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,375
That idiot. What kind
of mother raises

301
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,041
such a useless piece of shit?

302
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,958
He puts my balls
in a vice, and then,

303
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,583
oh, how convenient,
he goes and dies.

304
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,625
This is a fucking disaster.

305
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,500
I'd like the chance to kill
him myself all over again.

306
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,541
Eh? Oh. Uh...

307
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:23,666
[BALALAIKA] Well, well, well...
Moving out so suddenly?

308
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,708
That's such hard work.

309
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,458
Perhaps we could
help you, Mr. Chin.

310
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,375
Uh... N-N-Never mind.

311
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,041
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding here.

312
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,666
I don't know what kind
of pathetic rumor

313
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,625
is floating around town.
If we just sit down over lunch,

314
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,083
you'll see there's a
perfectly good explanation.

315
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,500
It's plain to see...

316
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,541
[grunting]

317
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,583
[BALALAIKA] Listen carefully,
you piece of horseshit--

318
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,166
we didn't come here so
you could tell us a story.

319
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,750
We already know
everything we need to.

320
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,583
Pray. That's about the
only thing you can still do

321
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,166
while you're alive.

322
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,125
Ah, this sucks. We busted our
asses for nothing. What a waste.

323
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,375
It's not so bad.

324
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,791
Kind of like being
bitten by a dog.

325
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,291
[phone ringing]

326
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,916
You dumbass, I'm serious.
Bullets aren't free, you know.

327
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,541
Hello. Lagoon Company.

328
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,333
[BALALAIKA] Oh, Japonski.
It's been a while.

329
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,291
Is Dutch around, by any chance?

330
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,500
Who is it?

331
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,416
[ROCK] Ms. Balalaika.

332
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:31,208
Hi there, Dutch. I heard you
went on a wild goose chase.

333
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,125
And you got stuck playing
games with Mr. Chin.

334
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,666
[DUTCH] Who told you about that?

335
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,541
He told me himself.
Let's just say he's a bit

336
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:42,041
too loud to organize
any kind of conspiracy.

337
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,958
He was blabbing away to
just about everyone in town.

338
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,500
Even the dead would have
known what was happening.

339
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,291
Anyway, we'll make sure nothing
like this happens again.

340
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,791
It was a real pain
for you, wasn't it?

341
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,333
No. Wouldn't say that.

342
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,625
It wasn't even enough
to give me a headache.

343
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,125
[BALALAIKA] Thanks, Dutch.

344
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,083
I realize it's hardly enough
after what you went through,

345
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,000
but I'll let you hear
something amusing.

346
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,041
They call this
"pleasure and pain."

347
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,791
[DUTCH] Oh, is it
cooler than JB?

348
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,416
Of course.

349
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,416
Yeah, that sounded cool.

350
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,458
[BALALAIKA] We'll have
a job for you soon.

351
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,041
I'll call you then.

352
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,541
Was that a call about a job?

353
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,916
[DUTCH] Something like that.

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,708
She filled me in on some
gossip to cheer me up.

355
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,500
Revy. Rock. You guys
have any plans?

356
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,958
[REVY] Not really.

357
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,250
[DUTCH] You, Benny?

358
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,500
Bit of maintenance work
on the electronics,

359
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,000
but nothing that
can't wait a day.

360
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,541
Alright then.

361
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,250
Considering the mental
anguish you incurred

362
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,958
due to external interference,

363
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,333
as your employer, I should
provide entertainment

364
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:48,375
as compensation. And after
careful consideration...

365
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,333
--Huh?
--...I'd like to propose

366
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:53,125
a trip to the Yellow Flag
tonight to drink away our pain.

367
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,125
This one's on me, of course.
So, who's coming?

368
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,000
[REVY] You serious?
Can we stay there 'til dawn?

369
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,333
[BENNY] I'm in.

370
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,541
--[ROCK] Uh, me too.
--[REVY] Then it's decided.

371
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:01,791
Benny, get the car.

372
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,250
Rock, you're not
on the job anymore.

373
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,375
You should wear that
Hawaiian shirt I got you.

374
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,041
[ROCK] I don't want to.

375
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,125
[CAPTAIN AHBE] Despite that,
there are still some fights

376
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,166
that you must
take on. Let's go!

377
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,041
Prepare the torpedoes
for surface attack.
