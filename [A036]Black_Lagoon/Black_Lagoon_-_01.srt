1
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,833
[ROCK] Graduating from
a national university,

2
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:11,208
I somehow managed to make my
way into the corporate world.

3
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,583
This is a businessman's town.

4
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,708
I get my ass kicked
by my boss all day.

5
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:20,250
But at the same time, I hope
to be in his place someday.

6
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:23,375
It's the only way to
maintain your sanity here.

7
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:27,125
This is the city of winter,
where I once lived.

8
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,750
It all seems so far away.

9
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,500
Right now, all that's in front
of me is the shimmering water

10
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,291
of the South China Sea.

11
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:38,166
The stirring winds of--

12
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,666
[grunting]

13
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,750
[DUTCH] Alright, Mr. Japanese.
I'll ask you one more time--

14
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,250
the package you got from the
Asahi Industry headquarters

15
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,666
in Tokyo, the one
you're in charge of until

16
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,208
you hand it over to the chief
in Borneo. This is it, right?

17
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,333
Yeah, but what
I want to know is--

18
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:58,083
We're all done with you now.

19
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,208
You've given us what we wanted.

20
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,166
Dutch, this is
a pain in the ass.

21
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,250
I say we kneecap this pussy.

22
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,625
They'll be no secrets
after that.

23
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,208
There's no need.

24
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,375
That one disc is more than
enough for the compensation.

25
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,208
[REVY] You call
that compensation?

26
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,875
[BENNY] Dutch. Hey, Dutch.
You through with them yet?

27
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,625
There's something heading
straight for us from Subic Bay.

28
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:22,583
It's probably a patrol boat
from the Filipino Navy.

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,458
Don't panic, Benny-boy.
It's all been taken care of.

30
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,041
Start the engines.

31
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,833
[engines revving]

32
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,333
Now listen up, Gentlemen!

33
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:35,583
We're gonna disappear and
then you'll all be free to go.

34
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:36,916
But I'm warning you--

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,791
the deal's off if anyone
decides to come after us.

36
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,291
What you see there
is a torpedo launcher.

37
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:45,958
If you don't want to float home
on what's left of your ship,

38
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,458
I recommend you stay put
for the next half hour.

39
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,666
After that, you're free
to do as you wish.

40
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,041
We're gonna live.

41
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,083
Why are you looking so relaxed?

42
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:58,583
You're gonna tag along
with us, dumbass.

43
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,708
You're joking.
You're joking, right?

44
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,166
Now shut up and walk.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
[ROCK] You're joking, right?!

46
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,041
Japan is drifting farther away.

47
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:18,083
This is Black Lagoon to
Balalaika. Can you hear me?

48
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,875
[BALALAIKA]  Just fine, Dutch.
What about the catch?

49
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,333
[DUTCH] I've got it, of course.

50
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,125
I admire smart work, Dutch.

51
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,875
[DUTCH] The trade-off
goes as planned.

52
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,958
Yes, just as I promised.

53
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,500
[phone dialing]

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,333
[phone ringing]

55
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,208
Connect me to Tokyo.

56
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
[EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR]
Well, Kageyama,

57
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,541
as Resource Investigation
Division Manager,

58
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,125
how do you explain this?

59
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,541
[KAGEYAMA] Regarding the case
we've recently been informed of,

60
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:47,625
let me explain the situation
to you in greater detail.

61
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,333
Today at approximately 4:00 PM,

62
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,500
a certain Bougainvillea
Trade Company contacted us,

63
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,083
wishing to negotiate
an agreement

64
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,916
for the safe return
of our disc,

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,791
which was stolen from
the Melanesia earlier today.

66
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,750
[VICE PRESIDENT] What's
the story on this company?

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,458
They're the Russian Mafia.
Well, to be exact,

68
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,416
they're a front for the branch
that aims to take top position

69
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,791
after completely displacing
the Chinese Mafia 

70
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,208
from Southeast Asia.

71
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,208
What are they looking
for, specifically?

72
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,625
Do they want money?

73
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,208
[KAGEYAMA] Most likely,
they're out to Southeast Asia

74
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,416
where the barter is
going to take place.

75
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,333
They no doubt wish to take
part in some of our more

76
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,208
unsavory trade activities
in that area.

77
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,500
It's a regrettable development.

78
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,750
Blackmail.

79
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,083
It's shameful that we're
vulnerable to blackmail.

80
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,666
Based on what
we've heard so far,

81
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
it would seem to me
that at this point, anyway,

82
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,875
they don't really know
what's on the disc.

83
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,666
[VICE PRESIDENT] If they ever
found out, it would lead

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,375
to the worst scandal in
Asahi Industries' history.

85
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,083
[EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR] Indeed.

86
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:51,000
We have just received
a report from Jakarta.

87
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,750
According to a local Chinese
merchant we've been speaking to,

88
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:57,166
the Russian Mafia has yet
to receive the disc.

89
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,916
It is still in the
hands of the pirates

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,125
that attacked the Melanesia.

91
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:04,666
This is our chance.

92
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,458
We simply cannot trust
the word of the mafia on this.

93
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,583
We must get the disc at all
costs before it reaches them.

94
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:17,500
[MANAGING DIRECTOR] Before
it reaches them? But how?

95
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,916
I understand.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,833
The board will leave this matter
in your hands, Kageyama.

97
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,041
Choosing what actions to take

98
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,791
will also be your
responsibility.

99
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:29,458
Revy, what in the hell
are you planning to do

100
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,791
with this hostage now that
you brought him with us, huh?

101
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,125
Come on!

102
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,541
You don't get it, do ya?

103
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,375
You just don't get it,
do you, Dutch?

104
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,958
Think about it--we're getting
paid twenty grand for this job.

105
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,083
Only twenty grand!

106
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,208
What's wrong with collecting
a bonus by asking for a ransom?

107
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,125
You're being too simpleminded.

108
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,375
--You want to die, Benny?!
--Not really.

109
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:52,375
[DUTCH] So, who's going to
negotiate with Japan? You?

110
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:53,791
Do you have their phone number?

111
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:58,208
How 'bout a bank account
to receive the ransom payment?

112
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:02,166
Fine then! We'll just shoot
his ass and throw him overboard.

113
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,375
[ROCK] Stop it!

114
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,458
[DUTCH] Damn it!
Don't damage the ship.

115
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,166
[REVY] Shut up!

116
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:12,625
Dutch... Dutch, I get it.

117
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,750
You get what?

118
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,208
I get your point now,
so let me go.

119
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,625
Okay, Revy, let's play it cool.

120
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,916
I'm alive. I don't know why,
but somehow, I'm alive.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,916
[DUTCH] Alright, alright.
Let's go topside for a smoke.

122
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:33,916
[ROCK] What's going
to happen to me?

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,250
I guess we'll make contact
with your company somehow

124
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,000
and then we'll try
to set up a trade.

125
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,166
There's going to be
a ransom, huh?

126
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,291
This will go on
my permanent record.

127
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,208
But we have our own priorities
and that's just the way it is.

128
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,916
Getting the disc to our client
has got to come first.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,208
So, there's a client?
Now I get it.

130
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,958
We're nothing more
than delivery boys.

131
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,250
Sometimes, we'll break the rules
to put food on the table,

132
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,000
but that's business.

133
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,125
[ROCK] I guess this must be

134
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,541
what they call the
Stockholm Syndrome.

135
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,625
Right now, I feel like
this big guy next to me

136
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:12,375
is the only person I can
trust in the entire world.

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,333
[DUTCH] What's your name?

138
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:19,500
Okajima. Rokuro Okajima.

139
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,458
[BOARD MEMBER 3] What's
the name of that employee?

140
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:24,541
[KAGEYAMA] It's Okajima,
Sir. Rokuro Okajima.

141
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,791
[FUJIWARA] My managerial skills

142
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,958
are completely to blame
for all of this, Sir.

143
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,791
[BOARD MEMBER 3] Why didn't
you tell me about this earlier?

144
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,250
[FUJIWARA] I was only
informed recently, myself, Sir.

145
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,916
And because there were
no other employees

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,208
we could trust with
this sensitive information,

147
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:42,750
we ended up losing valuable
time in confirming our sources.

148
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,250
That's enough. Kageyama,
what are your thoughts?

149
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,916
Our company is currently
facing a crisis.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,375
And I'm afraid we can't accept
any more delays at this point.

151
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:54,625
The EO Company,

152
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,916
with whom we've made a
confidential contract,

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,625
has already sent
their professionals.

154
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,208
Well, it was your
responsibility, after all.

155
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,416
But I do feel bad
for this employee.

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,708
What's his name?

157
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:13,166
It's Okajima, Sir.
Rokuro Okajima.

158
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,166
So, you gonna join us, Rock?

159
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,125
"Rock"?

160
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,750
[BENNY] I think he means you.

161
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,416
Huh.

162
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,333
So, you comin' or what?

163
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:31,166
What? Where are you going?

164
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,791
Some place to get a drink.

165
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,166
Don't you want to come?

166
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,375
But... aren't I a hostage?

167
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,250
--[BENNY] We're leaving.
--[ROCK] Wait, I'm coming, too.

168
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,125
But where on earth am I?

169
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:10,333
[chattering]

170
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,666
[ROCK] I just don't get it.

171
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,125
Why is there a gun
on every table?

172
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,416
Is this the so-called bar
at the end of the world

173
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,041
you see in westerns?

174
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,583
[DUTCH] Good analogy.

175
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,708
This place was founded by the
Southern Vietnamese soldiers

176
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,958
who survived the war.

177
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,125
They started taking in
fugitive soldiers, too,

178
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,583
and before we knew it, the
place had gone straight to hell.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,083
Hookers, junkies,
mercenaries, hit men.

180
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,291
Irredeemable criminals,
every one of them.

181
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,250
Don't like it?

182
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,666
Japanese pubs...

183
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,041
[SHOP WOMAN] Order of
mackerel, chicken cartilage...

184
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,750
I don't know. I just love
those unguarded smiles.

185
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:46,333
Places like this...

186
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,458
Shut the fuck up before I toss
your ass out of here, damn it!

187
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,208
[ROCK] I usually try to
avoid confrontations.

188
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,125
[DUTCH] Your expression
says it all.

189
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:56,250
Benny, I'm gonna make a call.

190
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,125
[BENNY] Sure.

191
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,958
Dutch is a little bit unusual.

192
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,541
After being around him for
two years, all I can tell you

193
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,541
is that he's tough,
intelligent, and eccentric.

194
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,666
You can give up on
trying to figure him out.

195
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,666
Got it.

196
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,958
You seem different from
the other people around here.

197
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,583
Where'd you come from?

198
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,541
A college in Florida.

199
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,375
I was fooling around
and managed to piss off

200
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,833
the mafia and the FBI
at the same time.

201
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,125
And then...

202
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:23,958
[REVY] Yours truly stepped
in and saved his ass

203
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,791
before it was stuffed in
a bag and thrown overboard.

204
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:29,625
Stop the worthless storytelling.

205
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,875
You're too young
to be reminiscing.

206
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,916
Now, it's time for all
of us to go shot for shot.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,291
We came all the way
here for a drink.

208
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,583
Let's talk about something
a little more interesting,

209
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,291
Mr. Japanese.

210
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,833
This is...

211
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,625
You ask me, beer's
no different from piss.

212
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,291
That stuff will
never get you drunk.

213
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,833
A real man takes rum.

214
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,916
But if you don't
even have the balls

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,666
to keep up with a woman...

216
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,416
...then I'm not going
to try and force you.

217
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,625
Though I might want to
put a little dress on you

218
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:06,958
with some pretty ribbons
and take you out

219
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,250
for a night of dancing. Hm?

220
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,750
As a rule, I hate chugging
drinks like some teenager,

221
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,625
but I'll make an exception.

222
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,958
[gulping]

223
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,333
I was forced to
drink at college.

224
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,833
We're forced to drink
at company social events.

225
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,208
Never underestimate a
Japanese businessman.

226
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,750
Why you!

227
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,458
Hey, Bartender!

228
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:38,416
Bring us all the Bacardi
you got right now!

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,208
Jeez. And all this time here,

230
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,833
I was thinking you
didn't like confrontations.

231
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,791
No shit. That's definitely
not good news.

232
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, go on.

233
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,041
[BALALAIKA]
Something wasn't right

234
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,458
about Asahi
Industries' response,

235
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:55,000
so I left out some bait and
a Chinese rat went right for it.

236
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,166
In fact, I'm talking to him now.

237
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,375
[DUTCH] Who's on the move?

238
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,958
[BALALAIKA] One moment.

239
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,166
What's your owner's name?
Loud and clear.

240
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,916
Sh-Shingian!
Shingian Wan Taikei!

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,541
He sent his troops
to assassinate them.

242
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,125
He's sent mercenaries
to Roanapur.

243
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:14,916
Hear that?

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,041
[DUTCH] Yeah. Not good.

245
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,458
Tell me the number and
affiliation of those soldiers.

246
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,000
Speak up and make it fast.

247
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:22,791
[CHINESE MAN]
Guys from Extra Order,

248
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,375
a mercenary contracting agency!

249
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,041
I don't know how many there are.

250
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:30,333
The EO Company scouts
experienced war junkies.

251
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:31,541
[DUTCH] Just our luck.

252
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,083
Try not to die.

253
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,666
Let's get started.

254
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,208
[crowd cheering]

255
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,500
Huh?

256
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,833
Okay. Let's do it, boys.
Let's crash this party.

257
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:11,083
Give anyone trying to
escape an extra asshole.

258
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:14,416
Make sure there are only corpses
left when we're done here.

259
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,500
Revy, if these assholes
are your friends,

260
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,208
then you'd better
deal with them.

261
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,750
Don't know 'em.

262
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,083
Wow, you've bulletproofed
the bar, huh?

263
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,125
Yep. It can handle
up to fifty caliber.

264
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,083
[DUTCH] Revy?

265
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,166
[REVY] I'm okay!

266
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,041
Benny?

267
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,875
[BENNY] Miraculously, I'm alive!

268
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,375
--And Rock?
--[ROCK] Dead! People are dead!

269
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,375
I went to all the trouble
of graduating college

270
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,958
and got a job with a big
corporation. Where am I now?

271
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,208
This isn't fair.

272
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,833
[REVY] Don't cry, dipshit.

273
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:51,458
Don't you know you gotta
enjoy life or it'll slip away?

274
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,583
Revy! I think now's a good time

275
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,000
to show 'em why
you're called "Two-Hands."

276
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,125
[EO CAPTAIN] Secure the
building. I heard voices.

277
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:09,166
And there's nothin' I
hate more than survivors.

278
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,958
What a great line.

279
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,750
Got 'em for you, Dutch!

280
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,666
Don't come back here,
Revy! You pain in the ass!

281
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,791
How many times have
you destroyed my bar?

282
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:40,458
You owe me for all this
damage, you understand?

283
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,250
Or else I'm going to
weld your asshole shut

284
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,875
and make you a new
one on your head.

285
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,416
Got it. Dutch!

286
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,958
She's... smiling.

287
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,083
Hate to break it to you,
but at this rate,

288
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,791
I'd say trading you
is no longer an option.

289
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,000
Then what's gonna happen to me?

290
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,125
You weren't part of
our plans to begin with.

291
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,166
How 'bout we just
part ways here?

292
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,291
That's not fair.

293
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,458
I'm gonna die here.
Take me with you!

294
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,041
Fine then. But we can't
have you slowing us down.

295
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,458
Revy, we're leaving!

296
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,000
Gotcha.

297
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,875
Get in!

298
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,583
Take this, cocksuckers!

299
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,416
Hey, Dutch. Bao
was so pissed off,

300
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,208
he looked like a steaming pot.

301
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,916
He said unless we pay him back,
he's going to weld our assholes.

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,750
That's scary. I think
I'm gonna cry.

303
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,958
What the hell is this?

304
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:58,125
A movie? Am I in a movie?

305
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,708
Don't be stupid.

306
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,958
This is way more entertaining
than Hollywood's ever gonna be.

307
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,583
Captain, we've got sixteen
dead, eight wounded.

308
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:11,041
I'm sorry, Sir. We thought
they were a bunch of punks.

309
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,625
We underestimated them.

310
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:16,083
Well, Storm, we're not dealing
with some random amateurs here.

311
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:19,250
In fact, they scored quite
a victory against us today.

312
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,208
In Liberia, all we
had to shoot at

313
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,041
were tired old men
and little brats.

314
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:27,750
Too slow and no
fight left in 'em.

315
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:30,208
But these guys
are full of energy.

316
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,250
I've been waiting for
something like this.

317
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:35,875
[DUTCH] If we
maintain this speed,

318
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:38,875
we should reach
Belawan Port by daybreak.

319
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,416
We'll meet Balalaika there.

320
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,833
So, Rock...

321
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,250
Huh?

322
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,333
Benny's getting in touch
with your company as we speak.

323
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:49,875
Huh?

324
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,791
What the hell? So, there is
a way to get this done.

325
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,500
[DUTCH] If negotiations
don't go well,

326
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:59,000
we're going to have to leave
you in Malaya. I'm sorry.

327
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,375
The place is crawling with
lowlifes and bandits,

328
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,041
but you should survive
for a while. Okay?

329
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,250
Are you serious?!

330
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,375
You bring me this far
just to let me die?

331
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,791
What is this? After
dragging me everywhere?

332
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,166
You're the ones who
brought me here.

333
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,500
The least you could do
is leave me some place safe.

334
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,791
I wouldn't push your luck.

335
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,541
First, you come crying to us,

336
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:20,291
then you want to
use us like a taxi?

337
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:23,416
I know, why don't I do
you a fucking favor

338
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,333
and show you what
color your brain is?

339
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,541
Wait!

340
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,958
And we're connected.

341
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,333
We're using an assault dial,

342
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,458
so the line should
be totally secure.

343
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,500
Rock, it's your boss,
Mr. Kageyama.

344
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,291
Huh?

345
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,375
Hello there, Sir. Okajima
speaking. I'm very sorry.

346
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,916
Now, regarding the loss
of the disc, I can--

347
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,083
Right. There's no need
to worry about that anymore.

348
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:48,625
As far as I'm concerned,
that disc no longer exists.

349
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,500
[ROCK] I don't understand.

350
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,500
[KAGEYAMA] Given your situation,
I suppose it can't hurt

351
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:56,125
to tell you the truth.
Keep this to yourself.

352
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:57,833
It's difficult to explain,

353
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,333
but in order to hedge against
a downturn in business,

354
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,375
our board agreed to aid in the
development of nuclear weapons

355
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,000
for a certain war-torn country.

356
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:09,000
That disc contained the plans.

357
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,541
It's truly been nothing
but trouble for management.

358
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,958
I mean, nukes in
this day and age.

359
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,458
Really, it makes me
question their judgment.

360
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,375
Anyway, eventually,
I'll be in a position

361
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,583
to do something about this.

362
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:25,000
But in the meantime, this
cannot be made public, Okajima.

363
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,000
For the sake of the 50,000
employees of Asahi Industries,

364
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,541
disappear into the
South China Sea.

365
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,333
You'll be promoted up
to assistant manager

366
00:19:32,416 --> 00:19:34,250
and I'll also request
that the president

367
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,000
and all of the other board
members attend your funeral.

368
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,625
Well then, the professional
soldiers that we've hired

369
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,958
should be arriving shortly.

370
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,458
[EO CAPTAIN] Is it loaded?

371
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,750
[MAYER] Fully armed, Captain.
Rockets and machine guns.

372
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,000
The more you shoot,
the more the invoice will be.

373
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,333
The Japanese sure are generous.

374
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,750
[EO CAPTAIN] Let's move out!

375
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,791
[siren]

376
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,208
[gagging]

377
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,166
They weren't worried
about ditching you,

378
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,375
though I guess
I can sympathize.

379
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,250
Anyway, there goes the ransom,

380
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,333
which means I don't
get a bonus,

381
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:14,875
but is all of that really
enough to make you throw up?

382
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,041
Just leave me alone.

383
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,375
[BENNY] Revy,
are you up on deck?

384
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,916
Uh-huh.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,791
I'm picking up something and
it's coming straight at us,

386
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,416
but it's not a boat.

387
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,333
It's way too fast. It's at
three hours five minutes.

388
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,875
Can you see anything?

389
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,916
[REVY] It's a gunship
at minimum altitude.

390
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,333
Damn it! An attack helicopter?!

391
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,875
[MAYER] We have a visual.

392
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,625
I don't need confirmation.

393
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,250
I can smell it.
It's them alright.

394
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,208
Damn them. That's how
they're gonna kill me.

395
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,291
[REVY] Yo, Rock. Heads up.

396
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,708
A gun? I don't want it.
Don't make me hold this!

397
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,458
[REVY] Although, I guess
it won't be much more

398
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:55,666
than a comfort to you.

399
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,416
[BENNY] He's coming.
He's gonna bite our ass.

400
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,708
This isn't good.
We're in serious shit.

401
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:03,375
He's firing at us!

402
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,875
Ahh!

403
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,416
I'm pretty sure I know
it's not good, Dutch.

404
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,750
Hit it! Shoot it down!

405
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:12,916
Shut up!

406
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,416
You think you can do
any better, dipshit?

407
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,750
I hope you realize you're hiding
under a torpedo launcher!

408
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,000
Better make sure
you don't get blown up!

409
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,375
You dumbass!

410
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,416
I've had it with you guys. I'm
getting the hell out of here.

411
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,250
You limp-dick son of a bitch.
You running away?

412
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,291
Stop it. Why do I have
to suffer like this?

413
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,125
I can't take it anymore.

414
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,916
Good. We'll sit back
and watch 'em from up here.

415
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,625
But Captain, we have
the opportunity

416
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,208
to completely destroy them now.

417
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,416
You just don't get it, do you?

418
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,375
Right now, I got
these poor bastards

419
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:52,541
exactly where I want 'em.

420
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,166
Don't you want to have
a good, long laugh

421
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,916
while they cry, howl, and
piss themselves down there?

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,666
Damn it!

423
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,375
You all seem to think you can do
and say anything you want to me.

424
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,541
Everyone. Even my damn boss.

425
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:13,750
Will someone tell me why the
hell I have to suffer like this?

426
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:54,500
[ROCK] I'm already dead.
You said it, remember?
