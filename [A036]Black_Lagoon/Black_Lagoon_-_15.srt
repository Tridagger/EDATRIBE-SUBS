1
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,375
[GRETEL] But I'm offering
you 150 thousand dollars.

2
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,833
Doesn't matter!
After we kill these brats,

3
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:10,083
don't forget to pick up the
cash on the ground, 'kay, Eda?

4
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,041
Okay. Don't you fucking move.

5
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,666
[GRETEL] I guess this means...

6
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,583
...we're done talking.

7
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,625
[GRETEL giggling]

8
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:25,666
--Bastard!
--[JODOROWSKY] There they are!

9
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,208
Huh?

10
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:29,875
This is Jodorowsky!

11
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,750
Engaging enemy at Point Pskov!

12
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,250
[BALALAIKA] Roger.

13
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,333
--[EDA] What the fuck?!
--[REVY] Don't do it, Eda!

14
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,916
That's Hotel Moscow!

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,500
It's the Russians, <i>sora mea</i> .

16
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,500
They came out.

17
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:41,500
They have!

18
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,208
I know, <i>sora mea</i> ...

19
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,750
Wouldn't it be fun
to confuse these guys?

20
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:46,958
If we can eliminate a few,

21
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,041
they'll probably
return to their base!

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,708
That sounds like a good idea!

23
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:54,083
We'll split up so we can hunt
down the Russians separately!

24
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,750
Good luck, <i>sora mea</i> .

25
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,666
<i>Fratele meu</i> .

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,708
[HANSEL] I love you.

27
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:02,208
[GRETEL] Yes. I love you, too.

28
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,833
[crashing sound]

29
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,625
Right. Target was
lost in combat.

30
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,208
That's fine.

31
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,083
What's important is that we've
shown ourselves to the enemy.

32
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,791
Proceed under the assumption
that they have taken the bait.

33
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,833
Roger. All units,
you've got the go ahead.

34
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,916
[radio static]

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,250
[EUGENE] Lavochek Unit,
Lobosfski Unit.

36
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,958
Level two preparations
are complete.

37
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,958
Proceeding to final location.

38
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,083
[radio static]

39
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,416
[BARONIN] Target two located.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,583
Appears to be
pursuing Jodorowsky.

41
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:44,500
Confirm the number
of targets. Quickly!

42
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,666
This is Baronin to Okchabriagin.

43
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,333
I have only sighted target two.

44
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,041
I repeat, target two only.

45
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,833
Private Eugene confirming.

46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,083
I see the target
following Jodorowsky.

47
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm only seeing
one body, as well.

48
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,333
[BARONIN] As far as I can tell,

49
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,583
target two is still right
on Jodorowsky's tail.

50
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,583
[JODOROWSKY] I'll take him
to the drop point as planned.

51
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:04,166
So, only target two
has taken the bait?

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
[BARONIN] Yes, ma'am.

53
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,375
Very well. Bring this
one in and no mistakes.

54
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,125
Don't take anything for granted.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,916
Their instincts are extremely
sharp. It's probably better

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,250
to let them believe
they have the upper hand.

57
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,750
Keep that in mind and
proceed to the next stage.

58
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:20,250
Let's stir up a
little confusion.

59
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,625
[JODOROWSKY] I'll make sure
that my men hit it mafia-style.

60
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:25,458
Not to worry. We'll be
at the park entrance soon

61
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,166
and we'll be sure to strike
first once we get there.

62
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,750
[BALALAIKA] Your priority
should be to confuse

63
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:33,666
and frustrate them,
do you understand?

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,625
Frustration will
dull their senses,

65
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,333
which will make our job easier.

66
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,250
[JODOROWSKY] Roger.

67
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,916
[BALALAIKA] Sergeant, it's time.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,833
Take command of the final squad.

69
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
Yes, ma'am.

70
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:49,208
Best of luck to you, <i>Kapitän</i> .

71
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,458
[BALALAIKA] Thanks. That
goes for you too, Sergeant.

72
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,208
Now then... Guess it's
about time we put an end

73
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:04,416
to this boisterous
merrymaking.

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Damn it!

75
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:06,708
Well, I'm the one
who has to go back

76
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,041
to the Church empty-handed.

77
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,291
We should've just
taken the offer,

78
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
but that would've been
too easy, wouldn't it?!

79
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,500
Instead, you got greedy
and fucked us both!

80
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,291
Whiny bitch! You're lucky
I was around to save you

81
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,791
from having your
fuckin' balls shot off

82
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,541
by those guys from Hotel
Moscow! Remember that?!

83
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,208
Last time I checked,
I didn't have a set,

84
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,708
but maybe you do,
you nasty she-male

85
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,291
You asked for it, bitch!
Draw your gun right now!

86
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
When I'm finished with you,

87
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,000
you're gonna hafta
pick which asshole

88
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,625
you wanna shit through,
you got that?!

89
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,791
[REVY] Y'know,
I don't care anymore.

90
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,708
We fucked up. It's over.

91
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,791
Uh-huh. I didn't get
a penny outta this.

92
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,583
[REVY] Well, I'm going
back to the office.

93
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,333
Call me if something comes up.

94
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,833
Huh? Hey, hold on a second!
You can't just leave me!

95
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,125
Uh, what do you mean?

96
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,916
What the hell do
you think I mean?!

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,250
I can't walk to my car alone

98
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,125
when there's a
full-scale war going on.

99
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,250
You have to come with me!

100
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,083
I mean, we're
friends, aren't we?!

101
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,458
I'm sure you can handle
all that on your own.

102
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,500
I've got better things
to do than babysit you.

103
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,041
Wha...?

104
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:12,708
Fuck you, you
heartless bitch!

105
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,166
[gun cocking]
Huh?

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh. Hi, miss.

107
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,791
[EDA] Uh... How long
have you been there?

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,875
[GRETEL] A while. I was waiting
for you to be alone.

109
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,125
I didn't wanna face the two
of you all by myself.

110
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,541
[EDA] Fuck.

111
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,833
[GRETEL] You see,

112
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,833
there's something I want
you to help me with.

113
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,291
As soon as my brother
kills that Russian lady,

114
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,541
we'll hafta get
outta here right away.

115
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:40,791
Hmm?

116
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,041
But we already killed
Verrocchio and his men

117
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,958
who were supposed to
arrange that for us.

118
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,958
Dumb kid. If you knew
he was your handler,

119
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,625
then why the
hell'd you kill him?

120
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,583
Anyway, you have no reason
to kill Balalaika now.

121
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:53,541
So, why do you go on?
What's the point?

122
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:00,166
"Why," you ask?

123
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,000
Why do we continue,
what a question!

124
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,541
You're so funny!

125
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,666
Because we want to.

126
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
We don't need any other reason.

127
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,875
We want to, so we do it.

128
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,208
Huh?

129
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
[GRETEL] But right now,
that's not important.

130
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,208
I want you to introduce
me to an escape specialist.

131
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,666
It should be someone who
takes their job seriously.

132
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,916
So, can you tell me
who that is, miss?

133
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,708
[birds chirping]

134
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,875
There's no need to hide.

135
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,666
Why don't you come on out?

136
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,333
Hmph. You knew where I was.

137
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,083
That's very impressive, lady.

138
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,208
And your soldiers
are very good, too.

139
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,250
I chased them around
for quite a while,

140
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,875
but I couldn't
kill a single one.

141
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,000
So, what do you wanna do now?

142
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,833
Perhaps we could use
this time together to talk.

143
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,750
Let's see...

144
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:29,250
Maybe we could talk about
that soldier of yours.

145
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,958
A normal person would've
died a lot sooner,

146
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:35,125
but that man just
didn't want to let go.

147
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,375
Up until he died,
he kept yelling,

148
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,125
" <i>Kapitän</i> ! <i>Kapitän</i> !"

149
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,208
And when he finally died,
he went... [gagging]

150
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,208
...like that.

151
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,750
[BALALAIKA] Hmm.
You don't say...

152
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,000
You're a cold person, lady.
But know what?

153
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,916
It won't be very long...

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,208
...till you end up
like that man.

155
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,916
It's just a shame we don't
have much time left to talk.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,333
In that case, I've got
some bad news for you.

157
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:05,041
I'm sorry, little boy,
but... this is it.

158
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,500
The end of the line for you.

159
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,041
But before that happens,

160
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,166
you'll have to apologize for
all the mischief you've caused.

161
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,958
Isn't that right?

162
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:18,666
Now you're gonna kneel
before me and beg forgiveness.

163
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,208
--You're pretty fu--
--I said kneel!

164
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:30,625
[grunting]

165
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:44,291
As I said...
the end of the line.

166
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,041
If you were able
to think rationally,

167
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,125
it would've been
obvious to you...

168
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:53,083
...that as you pursued us, you
were being led to your death.

169
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,041
Take a look at yourself now--

170
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,083
a pathetic little brat
who's beyond all repair.

171
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,750
And like it or not, this is
where you're gonna die.

172
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,708
[HANSEL] You're funny, lady.

173
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,333
But what are you
talking about?

174
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,083
I'm not gonna die.

175
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,333
I can't die, b-beacause

176
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:15,041
I've killed so many
people in my life.

177
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,083
We've killed many...

178
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,041
[GRETEL'S VOICE]
...many... many...

179
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,125
[HANSEL] ...many people.

180
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,958
It means we get
to live on for...

181
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,375
[GRETEL'S VOICE]
...that much longer.

182
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,833
[HANSEL] We can... We can
add on to our lives.

183
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,416
[GRETEL'S VOICE] So, we're never
going to die. That's right.

184
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,416
We are eternal.

185
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,666
That's quite the
interesting religion.

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,125
It's a wonderful
thought I suppose.

187
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,958
However, I'm afraid that
Oingo Boingo said it best...

188
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,166
"No one lives forever."

189
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,208
That's just the way it goes.

190
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,791
Now then,

191
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,500
I suppose I could be cruel and
torture you before I kill you.

192
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:51,791
Considering what you
did to my comrade,

193
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,291
there's no question that
it would be appropriate.

194
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,250
But unfortunately,
I'm not as vulgar as you.

195
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,166
It would bring me
no satisfaction.

196
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,208
So, I think I'll
sit here and watch

197
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:05,541
until you've taken your
last miserable breath.

198
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,083
Judging by your wounds,

199
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,583
you have about
ten minutes at best.

200
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,291
I dedicate these
last few minutes

201
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,250
before you leave this world to
Sakharov and Menshov's souls.

202
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,291
May they rest in peace.

203
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,083
Although...

204
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,958
I'm certain you wouldn't
be able to understand.

205
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:31,000
[labored breathing]

206
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,708
[gasping sobs]

207
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,166
Don't cry, you fool.

That was hard, <i>Kapitän</i> .

212
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,750
Just watching
gave me the chills.

213
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,541
[BALALAIKA] I'm sorry.

214
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,291
I had to have my revenge
and you humored me.

215
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,458
[BORIS] <i>Kapitän</i> ...

216
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,708
[BALALAIKA] I'm getting
too old for this.

00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,708
I feel...

218
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,708

Goddamn,

00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,208
I sure as hell couldn't

232
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,291
[BENNY] You can say that again.

233
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,875
The sadistic serial killer
who terrorized all of Roanapur

235

Fine by me.

236
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,500
End of the day, she's
just another client.

237
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,708
Hey, where's Revy?

238
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,375
[BENNY] I know she was
really bent out of shape

239
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,916
about us taking that girl,

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,625
but right now, she's keeping
watch outside the cabin door.

241
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,833
You know, just in case
something happens to Rock.

242
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,291
[ROCK] That was
a beautiful song.

243
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,125
Where did you learn it?

244
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,791
I heard it on TV.

245
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,750
It's one of my favorite
songs of all time.

246
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,000
You know what else?

247
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,833
You're the first person
I've ever sung it to.

248
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,541
Well... not counting my brother.

249
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:05,875
Ah...

00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,041
[giggling]

251
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,125
H-Hey!

252
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,416
I've noticed that
you seem different

253
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,000
from everyone else, mister.

254
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,541
Huh?

255
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:15,375
It's almost like you're in a
different world or something.

256
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,375
Oh, yeah?

257
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,208
Guess I'm not used
to this job yet.

258
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,750
Go figure.

259
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,083
I like talking to you.
You're nice.

260
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,375
You know, I'm really good
at telling who's nice...

261
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,541
...and who's not.

262
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,583
[beeping noises]

00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,166
[clicking sound]

264
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,291
[DUTCH] Is this Balalaika?

265
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,625
[BALALAIKA] I presume
you know why I'm calling.

266
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,000
[DUTCH] Yeah.

267
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,166
To be honest, I'm surprised
you waited this long.

268
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,791
I have to ask, Dutch--

269
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,833
you do realize what
you're doing, right?

270
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,208
[DUTCH] Of course.

271
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,208
And the compensation
reflects the additional risks.

272
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,500
This isn't your good
deed for the year?

273
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,416
[DUTCH] Do I look like
a philanthropist to you?

274
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,916
Just checking.

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,250
Anyway, it helps me to determine
the appropriate response.

276
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,750
[DUTCH] Sounds like we both
gotta do what we gotta do.

277
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,875
Am I wrong, Balalaika?

278
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,750
Hey. We're heading south, Dutch.

279
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,166
[BALALAIKA] You're right, Dutch.

280
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,625
In fact, I've already made
a number of arrangements.

281
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,958
No doubt.

282
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,000
I think I see some of
those "arrangements" now.

283
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,416
No regrets and no
hard feelings, I trust.

284
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,416
Good luck, sailor.

285
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,250
[DUTCH] Roger, <i>Kapitän</i> .

286
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,041
--Sergeant.
--[BORIS] Yes?

287
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,166
Get me the E file
from the trouble list.

288
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,041
E?

289
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,166
Insurance with a good return.

290
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,750
The Vietnamese Navy?

291
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,166
Yeah. That's correct.

292
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,041
And they're out in force.

293
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,750
The long reach
of Hotel Moscow...

294
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,250
So, are we gonna fight?

295
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,208
[DUTCH] Not if we wanna live.
We're a torpedo boat.

296
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,041
These guys are equipped
with missiles.

297
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,416
And this makes life hard

298
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,458
'cause that eliminates
the Hainan Island route.

299
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,250
[BENNY] How 'bout Brunei?
Y'know, where Mary Lee is.

300
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,791
[DUTCH] Not an option.
We can't afford the time.

301
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,125
Then it looks like our
only remaining option

302
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,708
is to visit Elroy
in Pangkal Pinang.

303
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,833
Big Horn Elroy, huh?

304
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,458
Okay, that's where we'll go.

305
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,291
[BENNY] I'll go contact him.

306
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,750
[GRETEL] Oh...

307
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:03,416
I bet you the water and
the sky are beautiful today,

308
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
but I won't get
the chance to see it.

309
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:06,708
No fair.

310
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,166
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,666
[GRETEL] It's alright.
I'm used to it.

312
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,875
Have you never seen the sea?

313
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,791
Back when we were in Sicily

314
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,958
and we lived at the orphanage,

315
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,916
the only thing
we ever got to see

316
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,250
were those gray cement walls.

317
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,416
I was born in a small town
in the Carpathian mountains.

318
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,833
It was a dark and lonely place.

319
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,625
[ROCK] A certain
dictator passed a law

320
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:33,208
which made abortion illegal. His
plan was to ensure a workforce

321
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,208
for the future of the country.

322
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:39,166
In reality, most were too poor
to provide for their children.

323
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,625
Many families had no choice

324
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,541
but to put their kids
in state-run orphanages.

325
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:46,458
The secret police found
numerous uses for these orphans.

326
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,166
The dictator was killed,
but the orphans remained,

327
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,083
born of his policies
and abandoned by all.

328
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,875
[GRETEL] Once we were
sold to the mafia,

329
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,541
all we ever saw was
blood and darkness.

330
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,458
They would beat us
and kick us so hard,

331
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:02,000
that at night, I couldn't
stop peeing blood.

332
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,708
Every night, my brother and
I would talk to each other.

333
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,041
And we always wondered--

334
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,375
why was it that God wanted
us to suffer like that?

335
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,166
But know what?

336
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,125
After a while,
we stopped wondering,

337
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,500
because we both
realized something.

338
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,125
The other children would
be brought before us.

339
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,875
They'd be crying and then they'd
be beaten to death with bats

340
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,500
and you know what then?

341
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,958
The adults would
all be laughing.

342
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:28,291
My brother and I
started to laugh, too.

343
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,291
And while we laughed,
we realized,

344
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:33,375
this is how the
world really works.

345
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,458
Yes.

346
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,000
The world would keep turning,

347
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,708
as long as people
were being killed.

348
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,541
And that must be the
reason why we're here...

349
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,541
To keep doing it forever.

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,833
People kill, get killed,
and kill again...

351
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,958
This is the thread that
ties everyone together.

352
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,625
But... doesn't it
make you sad

353
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:55,333
that your brother
died because of that?

354
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,708
Huh? What are you talking about?

355
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:01,750
I'm not dead. I'm right here.

356
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,833
My sister and I are
always together, mister...

357
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,208
...because both of
us will live forever.

358
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,375
We can't be touched
by the thread.

359
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,166
That's how it will always be.

360
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,458
So you see,

361
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,583
all we have to do
is keep on killing.

362
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,041
That's the only
reason we're alive.

363
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,833
That's why we don't
have to be sad anymore.

364
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:21,250
The smell of blood,

365
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,666
the sound of screaming,
and the warmth of bowels...

366
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,791
We've learned to love it all.

367
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
No!

368
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,875
You're wrong! That's
not why you're here!

369
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,416
The world is a place
for you to find happiness!

370
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,708
Listen! Blood and darkness
are just a small part of it!

371
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:41,500
That's not all the
world has to offer!

372
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:46,041
Hey. It's okay,
mister. Don't cry.

373
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,333
This is the first time anyone's
ever been this nice to me, so...

374
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,833
Here. A gift for you.

375
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,291
[slamming door]

376
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:03,791
[BENNY] Huh?

377
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,083
--Rock?
--[REVY] Benny!

378
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:07,041
Go check on him, alright!

379
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,250
I'm gonna take care
of this fuckin' kid!

380
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,208
[BENNY] Yeah, alright!

381
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,208
[GRETEL] Ah!

382
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,583
[REVY] Well, well...

383
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,208
I guess even a little demon
like you has red blood.

384
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,416
Fuckin' pissant.

385
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,166
Let me tell you something--

386
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,375
Balalaika's not the only
one who's disappointed

387
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:22,875
that you're not dead.

388
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,375
[GRETEL giggling] It's funny.

389
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,791
You have the exact same smell.

390
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,375
It's the smell of blood
and rotten sewers.

391
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,500
It's because you and
I are the same thing.

392
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,166
[REVY] Look, I really
don't give a shit.

393
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,375
If you fuck with him again,
I'm gonna kill you.

394
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,583
Not to mention,

395
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,583
if you do anything
at all to piss me off,

396
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,041
I'll kill you for that, too.

397
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,250
[ROCK] Damn it!

398
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,875
Damn it! Why? Why did
this hafta happen?!

399
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,916
Everyone in her
life betrayed her!

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,416
They turned her into a monster!

401
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,791
They turned her into
a fuckin' monster!

402
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,458
--Goddamn it!
--[BENNY] Rock.

403
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,333
Sometimes it's best
to look the other way.

404
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:59,708
You have to do that if
you wanna survive here.

405
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,041
[ROCK] I'll...

406
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:04,875
You'll what?! Adopt her?!

407
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,458
Forget it.

408
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,791
You can't just undo
what's been done to her.

409
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,875
If only someone had shown
them a little kindness,

410
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,666
they might've gone to
school, made friends,

411
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,458
and lived happily ever after.

412
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,791
Who knows, right?

413
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,541
But... that didn't
happen, did it?

414
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,041
I'm sorry, but
stories like this

415
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:26,166
don't have happy
endings, Rock.

416
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,791
[ELROY] Dutch.

417
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,083
Long time no see.

418
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,333
Yeah, it has been a while.

419
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,958
I take it that's the cargo?

420
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,125
[DUTCH] Right. I know
it was last minute,

421
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,416
but were you able
to get her a passport?

422
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,291
[ELROY] Everything's
taken care of.

423
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,166
Besides, when isn't
it a rush job?

424
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,500
It was nice to
meet you, mister.

425
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,333
Hopefully we'll
meet again someday!

426
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,916
We could have a picnic!

427
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,875
Just you and me, 'kay mister?

428
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,291
Yeah.

429
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,166
That sounds wonderful.

430
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,291
Really wonderful.

431
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,791
[gunshot]

432
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,333
[startled gasp]

433
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,708
[GRETEL] It's beautiful.

434
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,250
The sky.

435
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,791
[ELROY] It was
Hotel Moscow, Dutch.

436
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,083
But you probably knew that.

437
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,708
You know you're done
as a getaway man.

438
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,208
I know. I'm washed up.

439
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,125
I have a son living
in South Africa.

440
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,041
I just got a letter
from his wife.

441
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:37,083
Only 34 years old...

442
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:40,333
...and the doctors just
diagnosed him with cancer.

443
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,875
Either way,

444
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:44,875
I'm getting too damn old to
keep walking the tightrope.

445
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,958
This was my last job.

446
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,500
For what it's worth,

447
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,833
Hotel Moscow paid me a hell
of a lot of money to do this.

448
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,125
Well, see ya.

449
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,833
Her last words were
"It's beautiful. The sky."

450
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,166
Fuckin' hell!

451
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,083
[DUTCH] Rock.

452
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
You better go find us a tarp.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,166
We're gonna hafta
cover up the body.

454
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,416
[ROCK] No, that
won't be necessary.

455
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,791
This is fine. Just like this.

456
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,291
She can look up at the sky,

457
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,458
and hear the ocean
as she sleeps.

458
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:24,291
<i>Where the darkness fill the air</i>

459
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:31,500
<i>Where it's icy cold</i>

460
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:38,625
<i>Where nobody has a name</i>

461
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:45,291
<i>Where living is not a game</i>

462
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:52,208
<i>There, I'll hide</i>
<i>my broken heart</i>

463
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:59,250
<i>Dying to survive</i>

464
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:06,083
<i>There, no one can see me cry</i>

465
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:13,208
<i>The tears of my lonely soul</i>

466
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:23,583
<i>I'll find peace of mind</i>

467
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:34,125
<i>In the dark and</i>
<i>cold world of midnight</i>

468
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:38,916
<i>Midnight (Midnight)</i>

469
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,750
<i>Midnight</i>

470
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:51,041
[JANE] The only reason
I accepted this job

471
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,375
in the first place is because
I was told I'd be able to make

472
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,041
perfect counterfeit money.
