1
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:05,291
I don't trust that look on
your face... It's weird.

2
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,833
I don't know what
you're talking about...

3
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,750
There's nothing weird about it.

4
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:12,750
I always look this
way when I ask for a favor.

5
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,500
You want my help... again?

6
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:18,250
Yeah. This is my "favor face".

7
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,208
It's true we both came
from similar backgrounds.

8
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,916
You and I are a lot alike.

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,166
The difference is
who we encountered in life.

10
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,958
Perhaps... It's not
too late for you...

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
What a load of crap.

12
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,875
What happens is
just what happens.

13
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,166
Like how my guns will always
beat your lame-ass footwork.

14
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,708
I know that for a fact.

15
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,625
And the last one
standing is always the one

16
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,833
who has the most power. Simple.

17
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,375
You want me to use this gun...?

18
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,583
That's right.
This gun will help us

19
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,083
bring the game to an end.

20
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:55,166
You should check your reflection
next time you sneer at someone.

21
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,666
You know what you look like?

22
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,166
Like a skeleton... dancing at
the Festival of the Dead.

23
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:11,791
Yeah, that's perfect! Ya fuckin'
nailed it, sweet cheeks!

24
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,958
I may be from
the Land of the Dead,

25
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,791
but I'm a fuckin'
well-armed skeleton!

26
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,250
That's where we're all from.

27
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,333
Me, your head maid,
those soldiers... everyone...

28
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:27,083
So, chiquita...
Welcome to my graveside,

29
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,750
leave a bottle of tequila and
some marigolds. In return...

30
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,916
I'll leave a chocolate skull
as an offering for your soul,

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,083
seeing as how
you're fixing to die here,

32
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:38,333
you pathetic little shit.

33
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:46,875
You ladies ready?!
Cuz, here comes my cock!

34
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,833
Yeah, that's right...
now start sucking!

35
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,250
So I talked for
a while with Mr. Rock.

36
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,041
And I talked to
that loco gunslinger.

37
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:59,041
I'm sick of letting them
push us around all the time.

38
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,208
Yeah... Um, be careful...

39
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,500
Young Master!

40
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,083
This feels great!

41
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,583
What in the world are
you doing, Young Master?!

42
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,000
Here, take my hand...

43
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,083
You too, Fabiola!

44
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,125
This isn't funny!

45
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,125
Catch!

46
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,625
Water fight...!

47
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,541
Are those dolphins?

48
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,541
Yeah, Benny.
Those are dolphins.

49
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:38,416
You know... Rock's okay but
how's Revy doing these days?

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,250
Well... she was chatting
with the little maid earlier...

51
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,208
But then she went
into the forward cabin

52
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,000
and now she won't come out.

53
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,375
Fuck...!

54
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,875
Everything's fine, Fabiola.

55
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,375
Uh... What is?

56
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,708
Me, I mean.

57
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,750
You thought I was starting
to lose it, didn't you?

58
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,916
No! I'd never think that...!

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,875
No more hesitating.

60
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,958
And no more letting other
people tell me what to do.

61
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:06,000
Fabiola, you saw
Roberta too, didn't you?

62
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:11,083
Yes, but the truth is...
she's in a lot of torment now.

63
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,333
She may have started out

64
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,208
intending to
avenge your father...

65
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,708
But I doubt if
she even remembers

66
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,666
why she wants to
kill those men anymore.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,125
Roberta's confused... She's
losing her grip on reality...

68
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,250
She thinks this will
atone for what she's done,

69
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:31,125
for all her past sins.

70
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,166
Our head maid
is very unyielding.

71
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,541
Murder is a sin to her
and she believes it needs to be

72
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,750
punished harshly
no matter what the cost.

73
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:44,500
Fabiola, listen carefully.
This is important.

74
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,208
Somehow I'm gonna
save Roberta. I swear it.

75
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,708
And no matter what
that salary man says...

76
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,791
I'll do it on my terms,
the way I want it to happen.

77
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:58,541
And even... If you went back to
Venezuela and left me alone...

78
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:03,166
I would still go on by myself
to save her and bring her back!

79
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,375
I'll become her strength...

80
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:09,666
And I'll make sure
that she never falls again!

81
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,208
Young Master...!

82
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,916
I don't want you to think
of me as your maid right now.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,708
So just listen to me.
Roberta might never get better.

84
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:25,791
In fact, by now she's
probably too far gone to save.

85
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,541
This isn't make-believe.

86
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:31,125
Even if she does come back with
us, she'll still be tormented!

87
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,958
I don't care. I'm doing it.

88
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,750
I see. Your mind's made up.

89
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,666
To be honest, I thought
you were going to quit.

90
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,750
Especially when you
saw how disturbed she was.

91
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,750
No matter how capable
and kind-hearted you are,

92
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:54,291
you've grown-up sheltered.

93
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,833
I assumed you'd
have gone home by now.

94
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,875
Instead... you're
actually sticking with this.

95
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,125
Yes, I refuse to let
her die alone in a ditch as

96
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,916
she fights by herself
against those awful men.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,916
Okay, let's save her!
The two of us can do it.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,250
Together, it's possible.

99
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:14,291
Right. May God protect us.

100
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,416
Yes, may God protect us.

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,375
Fuck... Raised in
a loving family...?

102
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,666
I hate hearing
that fuckin' shit...

103
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,416
You little whore...!

104
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,166
Where I grew up, there wasn't
anyone who gave a shit about me.

105
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,166
Fucking hate him!
Fucking, fuck, fuck...

106
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:35,666
Cocksucker...!

107
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,208
Mouthy bitch!

108
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,291
F... fuck you! Fucker!

109
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:44,791
You bastard! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! God damn you!

110
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,416
Fuck! You...
you... fuck...!

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,791
Becky! Get me a
drink, you little bi--

112
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,916
Go to hell!

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,791
Damn it... I wanted
to forget all that shit.

114
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,250
We're entering the Mekong
Delta right on schedule.

115
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,291
When it gets light, we'll
see how the water has turned

116
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,625
from a lovely blue
to a lovely... brown.

117
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,125
These are my old
"brown water" stomping grounds,

118
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,416
but I thought it'd be better to

119
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,666
pass through
under cover of darkness.

120
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:19,458
Benny.

121
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah?

122
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,708
From here on, we'll need to rely
on our GPS and echo sounder.

123
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,375
Plus... we now have access to

124
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
a mining company's
latest survey data.

125
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,541
Sucks how we gotta crawl.
The river's so shallow here.

126
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,708
You know who's waiting for us

127
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,583
at the end of this
little trip, don't you?

128
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,500
The maid.

129
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,583
Yup.

130
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,291
I swear...
This is giving me a rash.

131
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,583
The Japanese man said that...
you wanted to see me down here.

132
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:57,041
Major, this is the
gun that you gave me.

133
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,583
You're never going
to forget how I hurt you.

134
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,291
You're never
going to forgive.

135
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,500
I can see it in your eyes.

136
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,583
Are you going to shoot me?

137
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:08,041
You sound like you
believe in justice, Major.

138
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,375
If you really are
a man of your word...

139
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,791
You'll listen to
what I have to say.

140
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,208
Alright...
You've had your say.

141
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:27,791
But... as the commanding officer
I alone am responsible for

142
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,541
what happened to you,
your father and your maid.

143
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,791
I want the opportunity to let my
men fight to protect themselves.

144
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,458
Is that acceptable?

145
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:46,333
Hey. What did you put
in the Young Master's head?

146
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:52,916
Okay, then... How about I tell
you what's supposed to happen.

147
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,291
Attention!

148
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,791
Gentlemen, we will reach

149
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,166
our area of operation
sometime tonight.

150
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,541
Rest assured that the enemy

151
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,500
who pursued us
in Roanapur will be there.

152
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,958
That is guaranteed.

153
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,416
Let nothing stand in
the way of your mission!

154
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,291
Shane!

155
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:17,083
That woman... isn't she
connected to this boy?

156
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,166
Yeah, and I'm taking
responsibility for that.

157
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,958
You're fighting
for justice, gentlemen,

158
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,666
give it your
very best. That is all.

159
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,416
You can't ask him to do that!

160
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,916
Then let me ask you this:

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,625
Can you win without
taking some kind of risk?

162
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,208
His risk... You've been planning
this from the very start.

163
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,541
I have. I mapped out all the
risks except for the Americans.

164
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,916
They're the only X factor.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,500
When you reach
the end of the game

166
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,250
and you've factored in
everything except for luck,

167
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,541
that's when the
gambling is the sweetest.

168
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,541
That's... That's nothing but...

169
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,666
a load of fucking crap!

170
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,375
Here we are, people.

171
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,916
We're right on
the triple point border.

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,041
Welcome to the Golden Triangle.

173
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,833
A contested area where the
governments have no influence.

174
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,291
Thanks, Captain.

175
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,708
You can keep your thanks.
The bill's already been paid.

176
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,708
Get the fuck off my boat.

177
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:25,291
Sorry I said that.
This place gets to me.

178
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,000
Happy hunting!

179
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:40,916
Here's hoping it doesn't
come back to bite us in the ass.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,208
Did Garcia head
out with the Major?

181
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,500
Uh, yeah... he did.

182
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:50,083
Great! That's just perfect!

183
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,166
We're going to hit
the jackpot on this one!

184
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,250
He lost this gamble, Benny.

185
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,291
"Mr. Chang" is
gonna lose this time.

186
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,166
Echo to Alpha. We've
reached the enemy line.

187
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,875
All clear.
Coordinates are fixed.

188
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,041
Roger that. Standby.

189
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,833
This is Delta. Two hundred
yards from the enemy line.

190
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,250
Alpha rogers that.

191
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,000
All teams, surround site
zero two three zero.

192
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,041
Delta rogers that.

193
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,083
Echo rogers that.

194
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,583
Okay. We gotta
get to the site too.

195
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,916
Major! Major! This is Delta!

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,500
We've got strange objects
in front of the village.

197
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:39,375
Strange objects? Describe.

198
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,333
Rods. There are numerous thirty
inch metal rods on the path.

199
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,916
Charlie, Echo, any
anomalies in your vicinity?

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
About thirty inches long...?

201
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,166
Echo here.

202
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,083
We confirm they're
at this location too.

203
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:55,291
Dozens of rod-like objects,
spaced roughly three feet apart.

204
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,541
They don't appear
to be wired to explosives.

205
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,541
This is Charlie. Rods around
the village entrance here, too!

206
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,083
That's strange.
Maybe they're a barrier...?

207
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:04,750
Shane!

208
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,833
What're they for?

209
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,666
Think maybe
they're religious totems

210
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,333
for the Shan or Wazu tribes?

211
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,625
I've never heard of that.

212
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,500
Young Master...

213
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,666
Yeah. She's already here.

214
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,333
She's ready.

215
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,500
Echo to Alpha. Come in, Major.

216
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:30,416
This is Alpha. We've
reached our lookout post.

217
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,958
But... something
doesn't seem right.

218
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,458
No movement detected.

219
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,250
Is it abandoned?

220
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,041
Looks that way, Major.

221
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,291
Alpha to Charlie.
What's your status to the east?

222
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,833
Charlie here. No activity.

223
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,541
I can see the plant,
but there's nobody here.

224
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,041
Ah, I got a body!

225
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Echo to Alpha!
We got bodies here as well!

226
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,541
There are several
corpses near the gate.

227
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,416
Detecting a single
light source to the east.

228
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,125
Ray, we're too
far away from them.

229
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,208
Let's move!

230
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,416
Right behind you.

231
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,166
It's Package Romeo!

232
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,000
Positive ID on Package Romeo!

233
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:24,125
Listen up! The opium plants
are already out of action.

234
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,958
The only people here
are us and Package Romeo!

235
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:30,875
Package Romeo at
ten o'clock, moving fast!

236
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,708
She's headin' for the jungle!

237
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,833
Delta to Alpha! She's
stopped right in front of us.

238
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,958
She appears
to have a hostage!

239
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,625
Jesus! Target is
moving into the trees!

240
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,041
What's going on?

241
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,833
The target has a prisoner.
She just cut off his ear!

242
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,666
He's still alive,
he just screamed!

243
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,875
Who's the prisoner?

244
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,000
Must be Shi Yan.
He's the bait to draw us in.

245
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,791
Delta, is your
team closest to her?

246
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,041
Affirmative.

247
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay, then follow her,
but don't get too close.

248
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,291
Track target's
location at all times.

249
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,375
Delta rogers that!

250
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,750
All teams,
move in and cover Delta.

251
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,458
Delta to Alpha.
Target is not visible!

252
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,875
Alpha to Echo.
Can you see her?

253
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,125
Echo here. Give me a minute.

254
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,875
I have target in sight. Shit!

255
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,333
Delta, come in!
Please respond!

256
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,416
I swear by the
Holy Santa Maria...

257
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:45,250
I will destroy all those...
who are full of sin!

258
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,291
She took out
Murdoch and Garraty!

259
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,458
This is Sniper Unit two!

260
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,166
We lost the target,
but she took a hit!

261
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,583
Goddamn her!

262
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,250
She's avoiding the body
armor and targeting our heads!

263
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,291
Did all teams copy that?

264
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,083
Except for team leaders,
everyone remove night goggles!

265
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,333
Put on your face-masks!
Prepare for close combat!

266
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,416
Get your facemasks on! Fast!
We're moving in to help Delta!

267
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
Let's go!

268
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,333
Echo to Alpha.

269
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,916
Echo, status report.

270
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,875
We found Shi Yan in the jungle.

271
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,666
Be careful! There
are gonna be booby traps.

272
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,541
I saw a helluva
lot of dirty tricks

273
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,583
and some vicious
fighting in Vietnam.

274
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,083
Made me pretty much an expert,

275
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,875
and then some,
on jungle warfare.

276
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,416
If this were Guadalcanal,
we'd be humping mortars.

277
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,041
If this were 'Nam we'd
burn down the whole jungle

278
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,000
with a sky full of napalm...

279
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,250
along with the people
we were trying to help...

280
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,583
Echo to Alpha. We've got a
detonator here.

281
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,791
Looks like a numerical code.

282
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,208
You'll be so distracted
disarming the damn thing,

283
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,333
Package Romeo will
just walk up on ya!

284
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:10,125
No... Hold on, Gardner!

285
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,208
The whole setup is
the trap! Get outta there!

286
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,333
Roger that!

287
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,333
Team Echo, Pull back now!

288
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,541
Lieutenant Gardner,
there's something over there...

289
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,083
This is Echo leader.
She's killed Wright!

290
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,291
The shot penetrated his vest!

291
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,958
Package Romeo is
using flechette rounds!

292
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,166
She's firing
those rods with a musket!

293
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,875
Jesus Christ, she's hunting
us with a goddamn museum piece!

294
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,916
We saw the muzzle flash!

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,416
Fuckin' A, we got her scent!

296
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,875
Let's move it!

297
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,791
All those rods
she's been planting

298
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,041
in the jungle
are a message for us.

299
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,291
No one's gettin'
out of here alive.

300
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,041
All teams, slowly
pull out of the area.

301
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,791
Don't let your guard down.

302
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,708
Sanchez, get into position.

303
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,291
Sniper Team here.
We're covering the retreat.

304
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,041
Damn it...

305
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:21,291
I can't get outta here with all
these fucking wires she's laid!

306
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,333
Okay. Hold and
prepare for an attack.

307
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,416
She's got the teams in
the jungle trapped like rats.

308
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,208
Which direction is
she gonna hit them from?

309
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,458
Sniper Team, be careful!
She's still headed your way.

310
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
Aw, shit!

311
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,416
That's a direct hit.

312
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,291
I aimed for her leg because
I didn't wanna kill her...

313
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,875
And she got up and kept running!

314
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,458
Nice try.

315
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,375
Your tactics...
They won't work.

316
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,625
She's become a wounded tiger!

317
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:19,958
Let's go.

318
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,708
Listen, once Team Alpha gets
here and can provide cover,

319
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,000
we're gonna get the hell out!

320
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,208
We just have to
hang on 'til then!

321
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,416
Aw, shit...

322
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,666
Fuck these!
Come on, you bitch!

323
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,625
God damn you...!

324
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,583
Sanchez, where is she?

325
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,250
Come in! Return
to base immediately!

326
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:37,958
Your baby foxes
are dropping like flies.

327
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,333
I'm gonna skin all
their little coats!

328
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:46,125
The hunt isn't
over yet!

329
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:49,250
It's her.

330
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,041
Yeah.

331
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,000
You... crazy... bitch...!

332
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,375
Roberta... Roberta!

333
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,208
Can you hear me?

334
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,583
I finally caught
up with you, Roberta.

335
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,083
Listen carefully. I'm
going to tell you where I am.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,625
Please, come to me.
I'll be waiting for you.

337
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:44,958
Fuck it...

338
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,916
Fine, I get it!

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,208
I know exactly what I am.

340
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,208
Hey, Revy. It's almost time.

341
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:03,125
Won't be long
until this is all over.

342
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,125
Who gives a shit?

343
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:08,208
I've been working myself
up over a lot of fucking crap

344
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,916
that I tried my
hardest to forget...

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And it's all your fault!

346
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,375
Yeah... You know something?

347
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:20,166
I feel like everyone is dancing
on the palm of my hand, Revy.

348
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,750
Like I control the
fate of everyone in that city.

349
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,583
What's going on with you?

350
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:29,000
Jesus... maybe that mouthy
little twit was right after all,

351
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,666
you've totally changed.

352
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:34,875
Rock, you've spent
too much time in Roanapur.

353
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,500
That shithole of a city
has messed with your head.

354
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:41,958
Once this job is done...
get the fuck out.

355
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,375
What are you talking about?
The end is in sight here.

356
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:47,833
It's almost over.

357
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,500
I don't know who
the hell you are anymore...

358
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,666
Young Master...

359
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,541
Yes, Fabiola, I know.
I'm pretty scared, too.

360
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,458
I don't know what'll happen.

361
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:07,666
I'm not sure what Senor
Rock told you, Young Master...

362
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:12,291
But I know you can
do this. I have faith!

363
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:17,625
It won't be God who saves her.
You're the real savior here.

364
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,833
I believe in you.

365
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:21,416
Thank you...

366
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,875
It'll be morning before long.

367
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,833
Once the sun's up the opium army
will send out their day patrols

368
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,875
and we'll know
what happened last night.

369
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,708
But by then,
this game will be over.

370
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,041
You keep going on
about this game, Rock.

371
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,666
How can you be so sure
you have this figured out?

372
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:56,666
Yeah. It'll be
over in seconds.

373
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,500
And then everything
will be settled.

374
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,375
Come on, do you
even hear yourself?

375
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,375
Revy! I see it.

376
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,000
I know what's going
to happen down this path.

377
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,375
Young Master...!

378
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,708
What's that fox doing here?!

379
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:27,083
Master Garcia, I can't
tell if you're really here or...

380
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,958
not here, anymore.

381
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:31,458
Time is so hazy now...

382
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,958
I can hear the dead,
they speak to me day and night!

383
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:39,625
I don't even know
if I'm dead or alive.

384
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,416
It's all the same...
I just can't tell...

385
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,708
But it's okay! I'll be
fine once I've taken revenge!

386
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:49,041
Then I can go
back to the manor!

387
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:50,500
Roberta.

388
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,791
Who is this for?

389
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:56,208
All this time I
never cared about revenge.

390
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:59,708
Despite my constant defiance,
Chang let me carry out my plan

391
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,541
and actually
leave with Garcia. Why?

392
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,625
And Balalaika went
along with Chang's wishes

393
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:08,541
and let Roberta easily
escape rather than kill her.

394
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,708
Again, why?

395
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,541
Simple. Chang's goal wasn't
just about hiding Roanapur

396
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,625
from the eyes of the world...

397
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:21,458
He also wanted to use Roberta
to break Gray Fox's will.

398
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:25,541
This entire
region produces drugs

399
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,416
and Roanapur is the
transit port that moves them.

400
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Chang wanted Roberta
to attack the soldiers

401
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,958
to teach them a lesson...

402
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,250
To prevent the Americans from

403
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,541
bringing justice to
the Golden Triangle.

404
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:40,000
That... was his plan.
I changed it.

405
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,875
Rock, what's the point?

406
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,333
What the hell did
you get out of all this?

407
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,250
That's not true,
it does matter!

408
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:49,500
Those sinners killed your
father! They broke your heart!

409
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,083
They destroyed
everything important to me!

410
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:55,041
Young Master,
I have to kill him...!

411
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:57,416
No, Roberta, you're wrong.

412
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,916
No matter how many
people you condemn and punish,

413
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,791
you will never
atone for your sins.

414
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,208
It'll never be enough.

415
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,791
That's why you're not the one
who can bring this to an end.

416
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,375
Impossible!

417
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,250
You wouldn't...!
You would never kill someone!

418
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,541
There. Now it's over.

419
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:23,125
No! The Young Master would
never say that it's over!

420
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,583
This doesn't make amends!
Now no one will be saved.

421
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:29,666
You aren't the Young
Master, you're the enemy!

422
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,875
Is this your way of
taking revenge on Roanapur?

423
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,125
That city messes people up so
bad that when I hold out my hand

424
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:41,583
to try and help them...
I can't save even a single soul.

425
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,083
Are you still goin' on
about that girl in Tokyo...?

426
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:46,208
But this time, I'm going
to make a real difference

427
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:49,416
and that damned city's
not going to stop me.

428
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,291
I've thought hard
about this, Roberta.

429
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:53,083
What would I
say when I found you?

430
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,166
What words
should I tell you...?

431
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,875
But then... I realized that
words wouldn't be enough...

432
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,666
to change your mind.

433
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,958
Young Master!

434
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,875
I'm going to bet
everything on this.

435
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:09,750
Listen to me, Roberta. If
you trust me, then the bullet

436
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:14,791
I'm about to fire won't hurt
you. I guarantee you won't die.

437
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,375
Now let's finish this
never-ending dance of death...

438
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:22,791
Let's bring these
miserable stories of revenge

439
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,166
to an end with
this one gamble.

440
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,833
Roberta... are you ready?

441
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,125
And what'll happen to us...

442
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,291
You got someplace
else you wanna go?

443
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,541
Can't go back to your peaceful
hometown, you won't fit in.

444
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,291
I got a question...

445
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:48,666
You've been standing in the
twilight this whole time...

446
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,208
so why did you join the
rest of us in the darkness?

447
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,208
I wanted to win the game.

448
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,125
This was the
only way to finish it.

449
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:01,166
But... I'm fine with it.
You know why...?

450
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:06,500
Because... I realized this
is how you've always felt,

451
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:08,625
all the time, isn't it, Revy.

452
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,000
You don't fucking know me!

453
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,666
Oh my God...!

454
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,208
Young Master!

455
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,500
I... I couldn't stop myself!

456
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:29,458
I didn't mean to pull
the trigger, Master Garcia!

457
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:35,541
Roberta... look! Even though I
shot you... you're still alive.

458
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:50,208
You made it...
It's finally over, Roberta.

459
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,708
Master Garcia...
you're bleeding...!

460
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:55,458
It's all okay...

461
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:59,833
Young Master! I didn't mean to.
Where did my bullet hit you?!

462
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,375
Ray... Lower your weapon.

463
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:06,166
Sorry. You put on such a good
act I nearly started shooting.

464
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,333
Packed a worse
punch than I expected.

465
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,166
Get up! Stop
talking to your friend

466
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,541
and help the Young Master!

467
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,166
You live...?! How
are you still breathing?!

468
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,125
I'll send you to hell...!

469
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,333
Leave him...!

470
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:21,166
I killed him,
he's dead, the sin is mine.

471
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,833
You're a killer...
and so am I.

472
00:29:23,916 --> 00:29:28,250
There are no winners here.
Our sins are all that are left.

473
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:32,166
But, I promise I will help
you bear that terrible burden.

474
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,833
I will support you as we live
out our lives together in peace.

475
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,041
Yes, Young Master...

476
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,333
Nice face. What
happened last night?

477
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,458
Hey, look, Rock.

478
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,208
Mission's over. They're back.

479
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:52,458
Well...? How'd it go? Did
the Americans get Shi Yan?

480
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,416
Yeah, looks like it.
There are three stretchers.

481
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,625
Great!

482
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,500
This really was
the best case scenario!

483
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,875
Way to go, Garcia!

484
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,625
Good work,
I knew you could do it!

485
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,333
Thanks to you...

486
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:12,500
I actually managed to do
some good and save someone!

487
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:14,916
Mr. Rock...

488
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,458
Hey...!

489
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:16,791
We were lucky...

490
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,000
We were extremely
lucky out there in the jungle.

491
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,375
And you...

492
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,541
You're lucky, too.

493
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,833
You're a bastard who took
advantage of the Young Master's

494
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:31,666
gentle nature and made him play
a round of Cambodian Roulette!

495
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,333
Look, it's just a blank!

496
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:37,125
Your magic trick was nothing but
a handful of fake brass bullets!

497
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,833
We're never
coming back here...

498
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:43,750
And I hope we never
have to see you again.

499
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:47,041
Stay and dance with the rest of
the dead in that cursed city

500
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,416
until God himself
turns away in disgust!

501
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:56,166
No matter what she says...
we managed to win one today...

502
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,000
I know we did.

503
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:05,291
Cathy, honey! Put enough
milk and sugar in that coffee

504
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:08,208
to make a stack
of pancakes, ya hear?!

505
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,875
Boss, you wanna get diabetes?

506
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,791
C'mon, sweetheart,
you only get to live once.

507
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,708
So the Director went
to a private luncheon

508
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,125
with the NSA
advisor to the President.

509
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,083
We're going to clear all this up
at the next security meeting...

510
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:24,750
But I do know
we're getting jurisdiction

511
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,291
and custody of Shi Yan.

512
00:31:27,916 --> 00:31:29,875
That much is official.

513
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:32,416
Goodness, I bet that
made him a little upset.

514
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,333
He let loose with a whole parade

515
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,916
of four letter words
in that French restaurant!

516
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,125
Marvelous!

517
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:39,208
I know!

518
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:42,958
He didn't know
who he was messing with.

519
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,791
Y'goddamn right!

520
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,750
Man, you look like shit.

00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:51,500
Courtesy of Chang.
Apparently it's our bonus.

522
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,166
Didn't see that coming.

523
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,583
It's been months,

524
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,708
and it seems like it's
business as usual in Roanapur.

525
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,291
Money and guns
never go out of style.

526
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:04,833
That's not gonna
change anytime soon.

527
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:08,958
Somewhere out there.
Someone else won the bet.

528
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:12,250
I didn't save anyone.

529
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,166
It's gonna hurt if you keep

530
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,125
looking at that city
with life in your eyes.

531
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,541
But hey, that's
the path you've chosen.

532
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,416
Do what you gotta do so
you don't become a real corpse.

533
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,083
Bang!

534
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,791
You came pretty
close back there...

535
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:55,708
Yeah, I did.

536
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,583
But this
wasn't the time, Revy.

537
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,125
Maybe... someday...
