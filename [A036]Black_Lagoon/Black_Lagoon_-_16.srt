1
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,041
[ELVIS] Your selfishness is
starting to become a problem,

2
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,333
young lady. We're as interested
in the quality of the product

3
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,208
as you are. However,

4
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,208
don't forget that everything
has a time limit to it.

5
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:20,791
Soccer, football, the stock
exchange. Hell, even fucking.

6
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,291
[JANE] You people
are so shortsighted.

7
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,708
We're not there.
We're simply not there yet.

8
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:27,625
I'm sorry, but there's no way I
can release these as they are.

9
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:29,875
[ELVIS] Look, nobody's
planning to pass these off

10
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,125
to the US Treasury
Department, alright.

11
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,958
In fact, I bet out of all of
us, you and your friend here

12
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,958
are the only ones who even
give a shit about any of that.

13
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,458
You've gone over budget by
two hundred thousand dollars.

14
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:43,375
But I guess that's the price
of perfection, right?

15
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:49,458
And this job was supposed to be
finished over two months ago.

16
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:52,208
Now personally, I have a
hard time believing this,

17
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,916
but some of my
"investors" think, well,

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,166
they think you might be
trying to screw us over.

19
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,625
As in, maybe you feel
none of us are smart enough

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:01,458
to figure it all out.

21
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,291
[JANE] Theo. Just keep working.

22
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,541
[ELVIS] I'm sure
you can understand

23
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,041
how upset that would make them.

24
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,041
But I wouldn't
worry, sweetheart.

25
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,625
Lucky for you, I don't believe
a word of what they're saying.

26
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,166
And you better hope I'm right.

27
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,875
'Cause if what they're saying
turns out to be true,

28
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,458
I'm gonna have to
cut you in places

29
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,666
where you do not
want to be cut.

30
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,791
I'm not the kind of man
who likes to raise his hand

31
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,250
against a woman...
Well, most of the time.

32
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,750
So, what am I supposed
to do in this situation?

33
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,250
[gunshot]

34
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,166
Shit. I'm the one who's
gonna hafta clean this up.

35
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,916
[JANE] What did you
do that for?! Now...

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,541
--[ELVIS] Shut the fuck up.
--[JANE] Now we can't...

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,708
[ELVIS] We don't
have time to indulge

38
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,291
this little hobby
of yours any longer.

39
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,666
And our pockets aren't so deep

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,125
that we can keep
wasting money on you.

41
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,583
When I come back
here in two days,

42
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:50,750
you better have good
news for me, sweetheart.

43
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:56,875
[seagulls]

44
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,541
Fuck, it's hot!

45
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,333
Oww!

46
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:11,541
Fuck me! How much did
I drink last night, anyway?

47
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,916
Usually, I'm a cheap
bitch when I'm drunk.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,375
I never waste bullets
or buy the drinks, but...

49
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,208
...Jesus.

50
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,666
Aw, fuck!

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,916
Talk about a shitty
start to a shitty day.

52
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,041
[typing sounds]

53
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,166
So, how d'you like me now?

54
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,583
You're makin' this easy!

55
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,083
What?!

56
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,750
Fuck you. I gotta
go take a leak.

57
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,416
[chuckling]

58
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:53,125
[urine stream hitting water]

59
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,000
There.

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,125
No, I would never fix the
game or nothin' like that.

61
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,708
I was just... Huh?

62
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:02,833
[smashing sound]

63
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,583
[GANGSTER 1] Let me out! Hey!

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,666
[JANE] What is it
with this city?

65
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,000
Everyone looks so damn shady.

66
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,083
[bell tolling]

67
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,500
[EDA]
Alright, the Good Shepherd...

68
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,416
What's his weapon of choice?

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,666
[REVY] Huh?

70
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,916
[EDA] Psalm 23, verse four.

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,250
"Though I walk
through the valley

72
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:38,000
of the shadow of death..."
But what I wanna know is

73
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,125
what would you take with you?
You know, if you were him?

74
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:46,083
Oh. I'd say a
Jericho... 941 FBL.

75
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:49,541
[EDA] That's a pretty
limp-dick gun for Jesus.

76
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:51,791
You're the nun.
What's your fuckin' answer?

77
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,250
[EDA] Isn't it obvious?
This guy here.

78
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,833
[REVY] You're full of shit.

79
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,583
I mean, he was Jewish, right?

80
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,958
Of course he'd have
an Israeli-made gun.

81
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,833
[EDA] Goddamn heathen.
You're outta your league

82
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,250
when it comes to this shit.

83
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,958
[REVY] It's hot! If I knew
your AC was broken,

84
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,791
I wouldn't have come
here to begin with.

85
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,708
And the boat's way out
at the dock. Not my day.

86
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,708
[EDA] I know, you've
said it, like,

87
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,666
five fucking times already.

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,458
I swear, you're like
a broken jukebox.

89
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,250
So, what's up with you
and that handsome sailor

90
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:23,083
you got on board? It's been
almost a year now, hasn't it?

91
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,916
Believe me,
he's nothing special!

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,333
For one, he won't get rid
of that stupid shirt and tie

93
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,208
and every time we come
up against an enemy,

94
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,708
the guy gets kidnapped.

95
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,958
Oh, and did I mention the
guy's a total fuckin' stiff?!

96
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,916
Gimme a break! Save it for
someone who gives a shit!

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,541
It's a simple question, Revy.

98
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,791
Have you sampled
the goods or not?

99
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,750
Tch!

100
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:44,291
You're no fun at all. You better
not be holding out on me.

101
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,000
[REVY] Fuck, it's hot in here!

102
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,500
[knocking]

103
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,708
Hello?! Hello!
I'm being chased!

104
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,333
Please help me!

105
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,500
I think it's for you.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,208
Sorry! We're closed! Go away!

107
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,833
[JANE] I can hear you!
Let me in!

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,250
Please! Open up!

109
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,166
C'mon! You have
to open this do--

110
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,958
[EDA] What the hell's
your problem?!

111
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:09,416
Don't you know what
Jesus said in Luke 11?

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,041
"Don't trouble me. The door
is locked." Got that? Bitch.

113
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,250
B-But this is a
church, isn't it?

114
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:18,083
So what? God's not in today.

115
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,000
He's on vacation
in Vegas, alright.

116
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,416
You have to help me!

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,708
I'm not from here and I
didn't know where else to go.

118
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,166
There's no one I can trust!

119
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,833
I was told that the church
might be able to help and...

120
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,458
What's wrong with you?! Aren't
you supposed to be a nun?!

121
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,500
[EDA] Why don't you come
back on Judgment Day?

122
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,291
You do that and God will...

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,083
Jane. Don't make
things difficult.

124
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,416
C'mon, time to go home,
sweetheart.

125
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,416
[LOBOS] Mister Elvis,
you must be careful.

126
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,125
How many times do
I have to tell you?

127
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,833
Things are different here.

128
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:54,833
Sister. I just need to have a
little talk with this girl here.

129
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,958
Eda!

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,458
[EDA] Alright!

131
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,208
You fuckin' bastards!

132
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,375
Any idiot who shows up
and starts shooting at us...

133
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:17,166
...had better damn well
be prepared to go to war!

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,458
Shoot them! Now!

135
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,083
--Take 'em out! Kill 'em!
--Stop it! Don't shoot!

136
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,208
Just stay where you are!

137
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,625
Fuck that! I said shoot!

138
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:35,750
[EDA] Damn it!

139
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,916
[REVY] These guys
are pissing me off!

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,041
Sis! I'm here to help you!

141
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,416
That's "Sister" to you, jackass!

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,833
Who is this kid?

143
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,125
--New guy?
--Yeah!

144
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,708
I'm Ricardo, the new apprentice!

145
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,333
The sis has told me
so much about you, Revy!

146
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,083
--Call me Rico!
--Rico!

147
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,750
I told you not to call me Sis!

148
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,250
Revy! Hey, can you hear me?!

149
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,791
It's Lobos!

150
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,416
You can put your guns away now.

151
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,333
This is all a misunderstanding!
Look, I'm sure if we were--

152
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:06,083
Do I look like a fuckin'
idiot to you, Lobos?!

153
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:08,000
Misunderstanding my ass!

154
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,166
Damn right, you little pissant!
If you think you can just

155
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,041
walk away unharmed after
putting bullets in this church,

156
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,708
you've got another
thing coming!

157
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,458
You hear me?!

158
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,583
Oh, dear god! They'll kill
us all! We're doomed!

159
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:26,166
[SISTER YOLANDA] My, my.
What do we have here?

160
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,000
What a mess. Eda!

161
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,541
I'm beginning to lose
patience with you.

162
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,125
What have I told you about
doing this in the chapel?

163
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,708
Huh? Oh, I can explain...

164
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,000
[SISTER YOLANDA]
We'll talk later.

165
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,541
However, first thing's first.

166
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,291
We'll deal with
these non-believers

167
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:45,583
the same way we did with
the people of Beit Shemesh.

168
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,041
Shit! Let's get outta here!
You too, Mister Elvis!

169
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,333
I'll be back, you
goddamned bitches!

170
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,791
I'll make minced meat
outta the both of ya!

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,416
[SISTER YOLANDA] Oh my.

172
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,458
And who will pay
for these repairs?

173
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:16,250
Not to mention the bullets. It's
just like throwing money away.

174
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,333
I won't stand for it.

175
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,875
Now then...

176
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,375
I'd say you've got a lot of
explaining to do, young lady.

177
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,250
[JANE] Those men are from
the Nouveau Laredo Cartel.

178
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,625
They're a branch of the Gerolamo
<i>Familia</i> based out of Florida.

179
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,041
I was hired by the cartel
to fabricate old bills

180
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,083
that are out of circulation.

181
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,000
My counterfeit bill design team
is scattered all over the world,

182
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:47,791
but thanks to the Internet,
that's never been a problem.

183
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,708
I'm the team's chief organizer.

184
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:52,291
The leader, if you will.

185
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:56,250
So, what did you screw up to
end up being chased by them?

186
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,791
[JANE] Nothing!
We didn't screw up!

187
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,083
The problem was that they
were ignorant Neanderthals.

188
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,208
They lacked patience.
To be clear,

189
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,750
the only reason I accepted
this job in the first place

190
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:06,458
is because I was told
I'd be able to make

191
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,125
perfect counterfeit money.

192
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,833
I'll be the first to admit I was
shocked by the Super Z bills.

193
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:13,333
The paper it produced
was absolutely perfect.

194
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,708
Especially the
composition percentage.

195
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,333
The ratio of cotton
to linen fiber

196
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,875
is controlled at
exactly 76.8 to 23.2.

197
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,583
And yes, there are
some people who say

198
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,666
that you can produce
product in a laser printer,

199
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,041
but that's unforgivably
amateur in my opinion.

200
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,083
Compared to that, these guys
seemed quite professional.

201
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,958
They had a Swiss-made
printing press

202
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,416
specifically for this job.

203
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,333
Ooh, I'd do anything to get
my hands on one of those,

204
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,791
but they're monitored
so closely,

205
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:38,333
it's next to impossible
to do it.

206
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,583
Incidentally, we usually print
ours on a Heidelberg MF521,

207
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,208
which isn't too bad,

208
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,791
but it has its limits
and it shows in the work.

209
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,541
Pretty pathetic,
don't you think?

210
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
Meanwhile, these guys
decide they want to start

211
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,208
counterfeiting and gather
this huge budget for it

212
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,125
just like that, even though
I would've been able

213
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,083
to do it for way
less, seriously.

214
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,958
But even that machine started
to cause a bottleneck

215
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,583
in the workflow. For example,

216
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,875
the pressure along the outside
of the Faceplate Number.

217
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,166
We were using an adjustment
method of applying rubber

218
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,541
in order to alter the ink
pressure in each section.

219
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,833
But frankly, in
the grand scheme,

220
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,375
this method isn't too clever.

221
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,000
Since it's just as easy to use
UV radiation to set the ink

222
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,541
after allowing it
to print naturally,

223
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,250
thereby eradicating the need
for complex pressure adjustment.

224
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,208
We've had no problems
so far with sections

225
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,750
that are strictly
green and black,

226
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,333
but with the method
I just explained,

227
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,000
you'd really have to perfect the
details of the Treasury Seal.

228
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,541
Otherwise, the mounted
section on the outside

229
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:25,708
comes out looking uneven.

230
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,750
--And then...
--[EDA] Hey, hey, hey!

231
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:29,000
--Question.
--Ah, yes?

232
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,208
Sorry to interrupt you
in full flow, but...

233
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,125
--[JANE] What is it?
--Does this story you're telling

234
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,583
have an end?

235
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:35,833
Do we at least get
a bathroom break

236
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,916
like they had in
<i>Battle of the Bulge</i> ?

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
[JANE] You're the ones who
asked why I'm in this mess.

238
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,208
What? Are you bored?

239
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
Eda. Her attitude
reminds me of someone...

240
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,833
She's just like that bitch from
my childhood welfare center.

241
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,125
Whatever. Anyway, the fact
is that this type of research

242
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,958
requires both money and time.

243
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:52,458
--And so...
--That's enough.

244
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,583
I think we've all got the idea.

245
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,250
So, you thought you'd
dazzle 'em with your bullshit

246
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:59,250
and then find a way to
screw them over somehow?

247
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,250
That's exactly what
those idiots said.

248
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,500
Fine then. Proof over theory.

249
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,208
[REVY] Pfft. You want
me to judge your work?

250
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,166
Please. I'm guessing this'll
take me about two seconds.

251
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,333
Look here. On this one, the
print is off by half an inch,

252
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,291
not to mention the Treasury
Seal is way too green.

253
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,791
On the other hand, thread detail
on this one's a lot finer.

254
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,666
--So, how was that?
--Wow.

255
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,375
So, from what you're saying,
you'd take that bill

256
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,791
in your left hand and enjoy
a day of shopping at Sears,

257
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,708
would ya? How
unfortunate for you,

258
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,833
'cause you'd be going
straight to prison.

259
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,500
Look carefully at the
Federal Reserve Seal

260
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,916
on the bill in your left hand.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,625
--Hm?
--Hm?

262
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,708
I figured you wouldn't
pick up on it.

263
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,458
It's not unusual to see bleeding
and other inconsistencies

264
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,625
in print quality on
bills from the seventies.

265
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,125
But I think you'd
be hard-pressed

266
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,875
to find a Federal Reserve
with the letter M in its seal.

267
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,458
[SISTER YOLANDA]
You've managed to prove

268
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,208
that Miss Revy's eyes are about
as useful as a pair of marbles.

269
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,750
So, I'd be willing
to believe you.

270
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,250
But I think now
it's time for you

271
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,958
to get to the heart
of this little story.

272
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,333
We missed our deadline by
quite a significant margin.

273
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,875
But since I had an objective in
mind, I refused to compromise.

274
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:07,750
Then these thugs showed up
and they shot my operator, Theo,

275
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,708
who I'd brought with
me from Germany!

276
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,166
His job was to
manage all the data

277
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,833
sent to us by the other team
members. With him gone,

278
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,541
all of our efforts to this
point have been wasted.

279
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,291
They just didn't get it!

280
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,291
Anyway, I got fed up
dealing with their crap,

281
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,541
so I said goodbye to those
Neanderthals and now here I am.

282
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
That's everything.

283
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,166
So, it's all your fault.

284
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,041
Yeah. They had a deal and
she didn't keep up her end.

285
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,375
What?! Right! Why would
either of you understand?!

286
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,958
You're the kind of people
who spend their entire lives

287
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,833
fiddling around with their
guns or watching <i>NYPD Blue</i> !

288
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,541
So, I guess you'd
probably have a hard time

289
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,000
believing I watch
<i>Oprah</i> instead.

290
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,208
The result of the
extreme make-over,

291
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,958
right after the gunshot.

292
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,666
[SISTER YOLANDA] Young lady,
the Lord has guided you here.

293
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,208
And you're very fortunate. That
girl pointing her gun at you

294
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,416
happens to be an
escape specialist.

295
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,250
And her fee could
easily be covered

296
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,000
with those plates of yours.

297
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,916
[JANE] I'd hate to give you
anything that's incomplete.

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,708
But I'm pressed for time,

299
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:03,083
so I guess I can't really
afford to be picky.

300
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,166
Excluding my escape costs,
I'll sell it for thirty grand.

301
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,791
[SISTER YOLANDA]
Well, you're on your own.

302
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,708
Go make your request
to some other god.

303
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,041
What?! I don't get it!

304
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,833
Aren't you people servants
of God or something?!

305
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,333
[EDA] In Luke 16,
he says, "I tell you,

306
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,125
make friends for yourselves
with worldly wealth."

307
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,708
It's not worth it, Eda.

308
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,875
You can go and die
if that's what you want.

309
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,250
[JANE] Fine,
if that's how it is,

310
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,208
I don't need your
help, anyway.

311
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,458
But I do thank you for saving
me from a difficult situation.

312
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,583
Well, goodbye.

313
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,166
Hey. Before you go--

314
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,708
where're you planning
to stay tonight?

315
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,208
[JANE] I'll manage.

316
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:36,375
[EDA] Word to the wise--you go
to any of the usual motels

317
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,708
and you can pretty
much guarantee

318
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,041
you'll end up in the
morgue tomorrow morning.

319
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,375
Now if you'd like
to avoid all that,

320
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,416
there's this shithole
called the Ramsap Inn

321
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,416
just on the other side
of Chalquam Market.

322
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,791
Tell them Eda from
the church sent you

323
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,291
and they'll give you a
room, no questions asked.

324
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,208
Why tell me this?

325
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,125
Hey, I didn't say
it was free advice.

326
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,291
Leave a three hundred
dollar donation

327
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:58,708
in the offering tray
on the way out.

328
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,250
I see. So, this is
a church, after all.

329
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,083
I can agree to that.

330
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,708
What was that?
You let her off too easy.

331
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,583
[EDA] Hm? Whaddya mean?

332
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,416
[SISTER YOLANDA]
Very well done, Eda.

333
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,375
That tree will
bear golden fruit,

334
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,708
so don't lose sight of her.

335
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,708
[EDA] Yes, Sister.

336
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,875
These naïve foreigners

337
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,958
are so easy to manipulate.
[phone ringing]

338
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,166
--Hey!
--Hi, Leroy! Long time no see!

339
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,041
You know that girl that Lobos
and the guys are chasing after?

340
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,166
--Yeah, the East Indian girl.
--[REVY] You bitch!

341
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,750
[EDA] Say I knew
where she was...

342
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,208
What would that info
be worth to you?

343
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,500
[REVY] You're playing dirty!

344
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,375
You actually know where she is?

345
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,500
Yes, Boss.

346
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,791
That bastard Lobos
is a goddamn coward.

347
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,291
I want you to go instead.

348
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,875
Yes, Boss.

349
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,500
Listen, Russell! These people
are no different from the Moro!

350
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:46,083
Th-They're goddamn savages,
all of 'em! Can you believe it?!

351
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,041
Even the nuns at that damn
church were shooting at us!

352
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,250
[groaning]

353
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,416
--Boss?
--Damn it all to hell.

354
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,916
I gotta get the fuck out of
this God's asshole of a city

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,583
and get back to civilized
Florida, you hear?

356
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,666
I've had enough of
this shit already!

357
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,208
[RUSSELL] Yes, Boss.

358
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:04,083
Russell, you capture that
Indian girl and bring her to me

359
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,375
no matter what it
takes, you got it?

360
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,291
When I see that bitch,
I'm gonna give her a beating

361
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,458
that'll make Dachau
seem like paradise.

362
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,708
[RUSSELL] Yes, Boss.

363
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,833
After all, I came here
all the way from Florida

364
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,833
just in case something
like this happened.

365
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:18,125
Hell, in three days,
you'll be sippin' margaritas

366
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:22,333
and watching the Caribbean
sunset with Don Gerolamo, Boss.

367
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,375
You just leave it to me
'cause I'm your trouble buster,

368
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,458
"Groovy Guy" Russell.

369
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,083
--[REVY] Hm!
--[EDA] What's wrong?

370
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,333
You got a splinter or something?

371
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:47,583
Don't play dumb.

372
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,041
If you're making money
off a trick like that,

373
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,291
you're giving me half.

374
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,083
It's like I said--you
gotta be patient, Revy.

375
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,208
With stuff like this...

376
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,958
...you cook before you eat.

377
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,000
[REVY] "Cook before you eat"?

378
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,916
What's that supposed to mean?

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,958
[EDA] It's like the slot
machines at a casino.

380
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,291
It won't pay out right away,

381
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,875
but if you wait till
the right moment,

382
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,250
coins come pouring out.

383
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,916
What are you planning?

384
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,875
Alright. We're here,
just follow me.

385
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,083
[REVY] You've got that
look right now, Eda.

386
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:30,333
You might as well fess up.
What'd you do?

387
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,208
Come on. Don't forget I work
for the original trickster.

388
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,708
A man who made water into wine

389
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,583
and walked on
the Sea of Galilee.

390
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,000
A trick like this is
nothing compared to that.

391
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,458
Anyway, Rock's bringing
the car around, isn't he?

392
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,541
Let's go.

393
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,083
First, you tell me
where we're going!

394
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,625
--I dunno.
--Hey, Eda!

395
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,708
I'm talking to you, bitch!

396
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,166
--Sister.
--[REVY] Hold it!

397
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,375
--Hey, Eda!
--Damn.

398
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:57,916
Listen up! Who are the
guys Lobos called here?

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,208
[QUENTIN] Everyone you see
sitting at these tables.

400
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,500
Alright then, I'll be giving you
your orders from here on out.

401
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,333
A thousand bucks a person.

402
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,416
She's staying at a motel
called the Ramsap Inn.

403
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,541
Your job is to bring
her back alive.

404
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,750
By alive, I mean
not dead, got it?

405
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,000
If she makes trouble for you,

406
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,750
you're free to rough
her up a little.

407
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,791
Goddamn, it's a job so easy,
even a child could do it.

408
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,291
We not need extra jab
from you, stupid cowboy man.

409
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:25,125
If I not have free time, I don't
accept cheap job like this!

410
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,166
[RUSSELL] You...

411
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,375
Shen Hua's right
about that, jackass!

412
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,500
Shouldn't you be fuckin'
cows back on the range?

413
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,625
Damn you!

414
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,791
[HUNTER 1] You're
pretty fuckin' bossy

415
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,000
for a guy who just
stepped off the plane!

416
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,416
[HUNTER 2] I don't
like his style!

417
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,583
Shut up and listen to what
I hafta say, you bastards!

418
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,208
[speaking through device]
If you want us to listen,

419
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,041
you could start
by introducing us

420
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,833
to the new faces
sitting over there.

421
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,125
Hold on. Who are you?

422
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,166
[HUNTER 3] Yeah, I've
never seen her before.

423
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,208
[HUNTER 4] Anyone know where
she's been getting her work?

424
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,416
What are you talking
about, Shen Hua?

425
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,208
You hired me for a job just last
Tuesday. Don't you remember?

426
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,541
Huh? I hire you?

427
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,750
Hi! I so late.
You waiting long?

428
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,916
So sorry about that.
Are you ready?

429
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,666
Oh, you want know
how to cut him up?

430
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,166
Boss Chang say he want
to make example outta him.

431
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,708
You understand?

432
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,333
But he never tell me so far
if he want meat chop or minced.

433
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,083
I guess you decide.
[MAN WITH GAG groaning]

434
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,541
Well, I'm finish.
He all yours now.

435
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,666
You can take care
of things from here.

436
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,125
[HUNTERS reacting in background]

437
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,500
You Sawyer the Cleaner?!

438
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,541
[HUNTER 5] Oh, so that's
what you look like.

439
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,625
[HUNTER 6] You're always
wearing them goggles

440
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,416
--and the face mask.
--Okay, people.

441
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,291
Let's hurry up and get to work.
Whaddya say? How 'bout it?

442
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,916
Those are the new
faces over there.

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,041
[SHEN HUA] Oh, you're right.
I not seen them before.

444
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,916
[QUENTIN] Hey, you two,
what are your names?

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,541
Hi there. I'm Claude
"Torch" Weaver.

446
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,708
Lotton... "The Wizard."

447
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,833
[QUENTIN] Well, I hope you
won't cast a spell on me

448
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,750
for saying this, but is
that milk you're drinking?

449
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,291
[LOTTON] I'm allergic to
alcohol. It makes me vomit.

450
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,791
It's against my
religion to drink.

451
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,625
Well, that's pretty pansy-assed.

452
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,708
So, what kind of weapon you
two use for hunting then?

453
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,250
[LOTTON] This.

454
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,291
[QUENTIN] What about you?

455
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,333
Don't tell me your religion
won't let you carry a gun.

456
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,416
[crowd reacting]

457
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,416
You idiot! Are you trying
to burn down the bar?!

458
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,666
Cut this out already!

459
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,166
That was very big surprise,

460
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,291
but now at least we know
what we using, right?

461
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,375
Everyone is okay
with that, yes?!

462
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,041
[HUNTER 7] Let's get this
over with and grab a drink.

463
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,000
[HUNTER 8] Hey, is Ramsap
Inn far from here?

464
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,666
[HUNTER 9] Can I get
a ride with someone?

465
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,708
Looks like you're
picking up the tab.

466
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:35,916
[RUSSELL] Damn it!

467
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,625
[SHEN HUA] Cowboy man,
why you stand still?

468
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,833
We leaving now, yes?

469
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,041
[EDA] Okay. Right here
should be good.

470
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:43,208
Pull over and kill the engine.

471
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,000
Alright, good work, driver.

472
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:47,250
And what's so special
about this spot?

473
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,958
What the hell are we doing here?

474
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,583
If you just shut up and wait,

475
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,500
then something very convenient
is going to happen for us.

476
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,208
You know, you have a way of
making things sound immoral.

477
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:02,250
[distant sirens]

478
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,791
[QUENTIN] Alright then, guys!
Let's get going, shall we?

479
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,000
Let's get this useless,
cheap-ass job over with!
