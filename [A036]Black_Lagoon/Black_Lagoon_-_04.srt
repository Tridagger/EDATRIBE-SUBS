1
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:11,166
[ROCK] The sea's so calm today.
It's incredible!

2
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,333
The waters around here

3
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:14,166
can look like something
from an acid trip.

4
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,875
You dive in and it's pretty
much a sensory overload.

5
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm sure it is.

6
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:21,208
I went scuba diving a while
back at Ishigaki Island.

7
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,750
Now that sounds privileged.

8
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,041
Like another exciting day in
the life of a yuppie bachelor.

9
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:28,166
It wasn't all that great.

10
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,666
Drinking this beer and feeling
the sea breeze on my face

11
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,125
is far more
privileged than that.

12
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:38,625
[harmonica]

13
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,375
So, this is "Farewell, Germany."

14
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,666
It's a shame that the last
glimpse I'm going to get

15
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,625
of the German sky is of
its usual leaden color.

16
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,875
Yes, but thanks to that,

17
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,541
the Allies' patrol
over us has thinned.

18
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,208
Once we're passed the
Shetlands and North Sea,

19
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,916
in no time, we'll be
under Spain's blue sky

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,875
and then on to
Africa's beaches.

21
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,750
You'll soon be longing
for some clouds,

22
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,041
Lieutenant Colonel Matsuto.

23
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,250
Right. As a man who came
here to study aeronautics,

24
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,375
I can hardly afford to be killed
by a plane at this point.

25
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,416
[CAPTAIN AHBE] Not after
coming all the way to Germany.

26
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,500
It seems that we'll get along
just fine on this journey.

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:35,875
But I wish I could say the same
about that other passenger.

28
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,833
[CAPTAIN AHBE] I just
don't understand them.

29
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:43,625
The SS and the SDs, those men,
they're a different breed.

30
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,333
[ROCK] Oh, man.
Now that I think about it,

31
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,208
maybe I did lead
a privileged life.

32
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,916
One little problem with
the car and all of a sudden,

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,041
life takes a major
turn for the worse here.

34
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:07,708
Mr. Lun, is that new? How much?

35
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,416
That's too high. It's
probably stolen, anyway.

36
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh well, then. It's not like
anyone here has cash to spare.

37
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:25,458
I better pass. I can already see
Revy calling me a sucker again.

38
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:36,833
[seagulls]

39
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,541
Check.

40
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,458
[CAPTAIN AHBE] Gentlemen,
we can all look forward

41
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,666
to sea turtle soup tonight.

42
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,541
[men cheering]

43
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,666
[CREWMAN 1] They're moving
with us on a bearing of 2-7-0.

44
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,833
It's a freighter out of
South Africa heading to Ceylon.

45
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,208
Ah, Captain.

46
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,125
We are in battle
positions right now.

47
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,041
I'm afraid you'll
have to go inside.

48
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,833
I'm sorry for the intrusion,

49
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,375
but I have something
to ask, if I may.

50
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,250
Do you really plan to ignore
the orders you were given

51
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,041
and attack that freighter?

52
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,541
What shall we do?

53
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:31,500
I'll get you to Batavia without
fail, Lieutenant Colonel.

54
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,333
--Now, Fritz. 
--Yes, sir.

55
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,416
Are you incapable of
even greeting the enemy

56
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,083
without confirmation?
And yet, you call yourself...

57
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,833
Very well, sir. I'll have them
hurry up and load the torpedo

58
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,875
that's under maintenance.

59
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:46,875
You too, Lieutenant Colonel.
Please get inside.

60
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,791
An attack would be
an unnecessary risk.

61
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,666
That transport belongs to
our sworn enemy--England.

62
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,166
What's being carried is fuel
to be used for an invasion

63
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,791
of our allies that
we'll soon be visiting.

64
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,291
And you're telling me
to ignore the enemy.

65
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,875
Are you saying there was no
point in us fighting this war?

66
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,625
That all those soldiers
died for nothing?

67
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,791
I am saying that at this
stage, sinking that ship

68
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,708
will have absolutely no
effect on our fatherland.

69
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,583
Hmph. Really?

70
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,333
What is it?

71
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:23,791
There's no point? We're just
fighting a losing battle here?

72
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:25,916
We can't stop the inevitable?

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you trying to provoke
me into saying more?

74
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:32,125
No, I didn't
expect that from you.

75
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,916
I suppose I thought
you were worried

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,291
about something
much more insignificant.

77
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,416
I apologize. Despite that,

78
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,083
there are still some fights
that you must take on.

79
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,458
Let's go. Prepare the torpedoes
for surface attack.

80
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,458
We'll credit this ship
with her 31st hit.

81
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,875
[CREWMAN 2] Launcher is ready.

82
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,166
[CAPTAIN AHBE]
Alright, let's go.

83
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,875
We'll keep fighting
to the very end.

84
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,625
[DUTCH] Aren't you
going for a drink?

85
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,875
I'll go as soon as
I'm done calculating

86
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,875
the torpedo boat's
fuel efficiency.

87
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,416
[DUTCH] Atta boy.

88
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,791
What's all that?

89
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,291
I dunno. Do I look like
an off-season Santa to you?

90
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:20,000
Earlier today, you were looking
around in the shop, weren't you?

91
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,250
Huh? No, but...

92
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,708
Just tell me when
you want something.

93
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:28,833
Huh? Hold on. Then you're
saying that's for me?

94
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,291
[chuckling]

95
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,041
The enemy ship has
just passed over us.

96
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:59,666
Set course to 2-0-0. We need
to get behind the enemy.

97
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,625
If we turn twice, we'll be
able to achieve that, sir.

98
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,875
The second turn will
be in four minutes.

99
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,083
Very well. Then that's
what we'll go with.

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,083
We're detecting sound from
another vessel in front of us.

101
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,500
Wait, there's another signal.

102
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:16,416
It looks like the enemy's
coming out in numbers.

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,041
Batavia's right there in front
of us and we're being cornered.

104
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,916
Not yet, gentlemen. I want
both engines to full power.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
--Set us to 1-7-0.
--[CREWMAN 3] 1-7-0!

106
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,208
Fire the Zigarren
directly astern.

107
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,791
[CREWMAN 2] Firing Zigarren!

108
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,750
One of the enemy
ships is moving away.

109
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,125
Then it must have worked.
They took the bait.

110
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,375
Now cut the engine. It's silent
running from now on.

111
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,416
One ship is staying
right with us.

112
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,791
[CREWMAN 2] They're using
their active sonar!

113
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,583
Full power! Twenty to port!
Dive to a depth of forty!

114
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,375
[alarm sounding]

115
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:25,000
This is the forward torpedo
room. We're taking on water.

116
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,791
Close the fore hatch! You can
still try to save yourselves!

117
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:37,791
[FRITZ] We are doing our best
to stop taking on water,

118
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,750
but we can't vent
the ballast tank.

119
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:41,416
Engines and the
emergency generator

120
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,625
are damaged beyond repair.

121
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,250
[CAPTAIN AHBE] It's
unfortunate that we couldn't

122
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,250
return our Japanese
passenger to his homeland.

123
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,833
Lieutenant Colonel Matsuto
has already...

124
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,000
The way of a samurai.
I didn't realize

125
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,708
he brought a sword
with him for that reason.

126
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:08,791
You've served as brave and loyal
sailors of the German Navy.

127
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,000
As a crew, we've
faced rough waters

128
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,125
and overcome great
opposition in the Atlantic,

129
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:17,208
but sadly, none of us will
leave this battle behind

130
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,083
for the beaches of Batavia.

131
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,333
Our ship has currently run
aground at a depth of 57 meters.

132
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,666
Both our engines and ballast
tank are beyond repair.

133
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,666
You have all endured numerous
battles and shown great courage.

134
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,625
As of now, I'm relieving you
of your military duties.

135
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,583
We are going to run out of
air in about two hours.

136
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,041
In these final moments, it is
your choice how you wish to die.

137
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,583
Lietenant Colonel,
I have to speak with you.

138
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,000
Captain,

139
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,208
I haven't heard the engine
running for some time now.

140
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,250
When are we going to surface?

141
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:58,375
As it turns out, we won't
be surfacing... ever again.

142
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,375
I'm truly sorry.

143
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:02,166
You are worthless.

144
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,583
I agree.

145
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,625
You don't get it! You just
don't understand, do you?!

146
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,750
Understand what?

147
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,625
The importance of your mission!

148
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:11,416
Do you have any idea
of the significance

149
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,875
of this painting
I'm transporting?

150
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,791
I see. So, the package
was this painting.

151
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,375
It doesn't look like anything
of great significance to me.

152
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,958
What is its title?

153
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,375
It's called "The Twelve
Knights Led by Brunhilda."

154
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,250
Listen to me carefully--what
I have in my hands right now

155
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:32,833
is the only tableau painted
since the Führer took power.

156
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,833
"Steadfast in our
honor and loyalty,

157
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,500
we shall keep this hidden
until the promised day.

158
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:41,791
On the day when the Nazi flag
flies victorious once again,

159
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,958
this will be a beacon
for all our comrades

160
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,291
who have scattered and
a call for reunification."

161
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,625
So, you've already resigned
yourself to the idea

162
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,416
that we're going
to lose this war.

163
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,750
And so you figured
you'd just start preparing

164
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:59,125
for the next one.
You people make me sick!

165
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,458
Do you have any family?

166
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:06,916
I have a wife and child. They
are in Stuttgard. So, what then?

167
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,291
You know, I can honestly say
I'm proud that I fought

168
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,833
to the very end for my country.

169
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,875
I have no regrets, even now
as I'm destined to rot here.

170
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,750
However, if there's one
dissatisfaction I do have,

171
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,500
it is the fact I must
share a casket

172
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,041
with some fucking
bastard like you,

173
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,916
who isn't even thinking about
his family in his dying moments.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,041
Take back that
statement, Captain!

175
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,208
You cannot compare family

176
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,250
to the righteousness
of our country!

177
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,625
It's pointless. 

178
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,916
You can deny it all you
want, but Hitler's empire

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,916
is crashing down around us
and there's nothing you can do.

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,916
Be quiet!

181
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,208
Look what's become
of my country

182
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,000
and my navy as a
result of putting up

183
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,041
with your delusions
for all these years.

184
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,041
Enough!

185
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,416
I'd even say it
was worth sinking

186
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,208
if it meant that my
children could grow up

187
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:56,625
without ever having to see
that accursed Nazi flag again.

188
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,000
Shut up! Take it back!

189
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,791
It could very well
be the will of God

190
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,125
that our boat sank here today.

191
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,458
[gunshots]

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,333
[ROCK] Damn it.

193
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,375
Why'd I have to go
and open my big mouth?

194
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:21,208
I've only been scuba diving once
in my life at Ishigaki Island.

195
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,750
Dutch tricked me into this.

196
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:27,500
That's the only thing you've
been saying since we left port!

197
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,291
Could you try to be a little
bit more interesting,

198
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,708
you blubbering idiot?

199
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,041
[ROCK] There's no way I'm gonna
be able to do this salvage.

200
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:45,333
Now, I explained this
briefly at the office,

201
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,291
but we'll go over the details
again before we go in.

202
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,000
Benny, will you start?

203
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,791
No problem. First of all,
let's take a look at this.

204
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,333
An old story from
half a century ago.

205
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,666
The nostalgic talk
of some old-timer.

206
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:04,583
IXC-type attack submarine
U-1324 of the German Navy.

207
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,375
It was a submarine in the wolf
pack that tore up the Atlantic.

208
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,625
The captain was
Major Venztel H. Ahbe.

209
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,833
The last order he ever received
from his falling homeland

210
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:19,791
was to take an officer of
the Japanese Navy to Batavia.

211
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,416
But things weren't
that simple for them.

212
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,166
They had to go
from Kiel in Europe,

213
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,000
around Cape Agulhas,
then through the Indian Ocean.

214
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,916
It's a voyage
worthy of Magellan.

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,458
And Ahbe managed to pull it off.

216
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:34,166
But when he was in plain
view of his destination,

217
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,458
his ship, all its crew members,
and the passengers on board

218
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,750
suddenly ran out of luck.

219
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,291
While searching
for the Japanese,

220
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,666
the US Navy came
across this U-boat.

221
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,791
Having nothing else to do,

222
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,208
all of them decided
to strike at once.

223
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,333
The poor U-1324
finally went down.

224
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:54,000
So, the captain and 44 of
his crew just disappeared

225
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,166
into the depths of the ocean.

226
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,458
That's sorta the history with
a capital "H" as we know it.

227
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,875
But there's another untold
story in all of this.

228
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,791
A story about an SS officer

229
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,541
who appeared at Kiel Port
the night before departure

230
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,833
and was able to
force his way on board

231
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:13,833
with papers from
the secret police.

232
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,958
Now check this out--

233
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,750
this is the painting
that SS officer

234
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,041
held on to for dear life.

235
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,208
The artist is August Janke,
an unknown painter.

236
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:30,250
Its title is "The Twelve
Knights Led by Brunhilda."

237
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,833
That thing looks
pretty boring to me.

238
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,625
I've seen graffiti
on New York subways

239
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,333
that would put that to shame.

240
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,500
Why would an SS officer board
a submarine with no gold,

241
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,166
no secret documents,
and only a single painting?

242
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,791
Don't give it too much thought.
It's just an incredible story.

243
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,750
I have no real explanation
for why it happened

244
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,125
or even where it came from.

245
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,500
However, the one thing we
are sure of right now is that

246
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:59,125
this painting is preserved
inside the wreck of a submarine.

247
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,291
We've been hired by an
antique collector in Spain.

248
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,750
And this guy's hobby happens
to be collecting Nazi artwork.

249
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,708
That's a pretty fucked up hobby.

250
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,083
Damn straight. Apparently
most of Janke's work

251
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,541
was destroyed or
lost in the war.

252
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:17,208
He'd completely given up on this
and the U-boat long ago, but...

253
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,708
Yeah. Last year,
a French telecom company

254
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,583
was laying down
underwater cables

255
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,291
and they inadvertently
discovered the U-1324.

256
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,333
At the same time, they found out
there wasn't much water inside.

257
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,791
Several countries
are in dispute

258
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,958
over the rightful ownership
of these waters,

259
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,000
so no one is able to
make a move for it easily.

260
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,583
And so, that's where
we come in, people.

261
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,791
Not bad for a fifty
thousand dollar job.

262
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,750
[BENNY] Okay, so here are the
steps for the job. Take a look.

263
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,916
The French noticed that
the bow end of the submarine

264
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,583
is completely flooded.
The two of you will go in

265
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,875
through the torpedo tubes
and then close 'em off.

266
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,791
Once you weld the hole shut,
you should be able

267
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,666
to open the door
to the interior.

268
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,916
W-Welding?

269
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,916
What do we do to get out?

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,541
Just make a hole in the
sub's hull and swim out.

271
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,208
Once we get what
we want out of there,

272
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,208
who cares what happens to it?

273
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,958
All right then,
let's get this over with.

274
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,208
I've never even done
weekend carpentry.

275
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:18,500
And we're supposed to do
all of this underwater?

276
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,666
I just don't see
how it'll work.

277
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,083
[REVY] Hey, are you done
checking the equipment?

278
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,500
If you keep up this bitching,

279
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,250
I'm gonna toss you overboard
without your tank.

280
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,875
Hm, yeah, I'm mostly done.

281
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,583
What about the
buoyancy compensator?

282
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,625
Did you test the
gauge? If you drown,

283
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,750
I'll leave you down there
in that metal casket

284
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:37,541
with those dead Nazis.

285
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,166
There's no need
to be difficult.

286
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,750
I said I'll be just fine.

287
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:44,125
If you die, you'll end up
causing me a lot of trouble.

288
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,375
So, stop talking back,

289
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,083
--you dumbass.
--[DUTCH] Revy, once you dive,

290
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,166
I'll only be able to
track you with the beacon.

291
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,583
Be careful not to
use up the batteries.

292
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,541
--Got it.
--[DUTCH] I almost forgot--

293
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,041
a little souvenir Balalaika
brought back from her homeland.

294
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,208
An underwater rifle! Does this
thing have full auto on it?

295
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,500
[DUTCH] Of course. Take it
as a good luck charm.

296
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,583
Okay, Rock. We better get going.
Just follow my lead!

297
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,291
So, you won her over with
a gun and saved Rock's ass.

298
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,458
You got a lot of
tricks up your sleeve.

299
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:24,000
Guess so. As an employer,
I worry about human relations.

300
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,666
All part of the job.

301
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,333
The beacon's been activated

302
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,000
and the PLRS is
working fine right now.

303
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,416
[DUTCH] Alright.

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,416
[BENNY] They're headed
straight for the salvage site.

305
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,791
Seems like Revy's used
to this kind of thing.

306
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:45,166
Of course she is.
I never would have hired her

307
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,750
if using those guns
was her only skill.

308
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,875
When it comes to swimming,
she's got natural talent.

309
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,958
Hmm...

310
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,291
--Uh, Dutch...
--What's up?

311
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,833
Come up here for a sec.
There's a ship.

312
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,208
[DUTCH] What?

313
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,750
We're not on a sea route.

314
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,541
The telecom company's
the only one who'd be here.

315
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:21,333
Telecom company?
I don't think so.

316
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,916
I've been listening
to their communications

317
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,791
ever since we got the offer.

318
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,916
They're not supposed to be out
here for another three days.

319
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,291
And besides,
that's a research ship.

320
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,458
And they seem to be carrying

321
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:32,666
some large equipment
on the back.

322
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,041
This isn't cool. You better
go raise our Thai Navy flag.

323
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,458
[BENNY] I'm on it.

324
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:39,875
[radio static]

325
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,166
[SOLDIER] To the vessel
currently idling in our path--

326
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,791
this is White Heather.
Please respond.

327
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,750
Well, well.

328
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,666
This is PT377 of the Thai Navy.

329
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,083
We are currently
on a mission here.

330
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,166
We'd like to inquire about your
purpose for being in this area.

331
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,041
Tell us your nationality,
ship number, and signal code.

332
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,125
[SOLDIER] We see
that you are acting

333
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,166
independently at
the present time.

334
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,000
Where is your mother ship?

335
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,416
That is classified
military information.

336
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,750
I'm requesting
for the second time

337
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,375
that you identify
yourself. Over.

338
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,625
[radio static]

339
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,416
These guys are
way too demanding.

340
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,041
Definitely not normal.

341
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,916
I'm going back
to the control room.

342
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,041
Keep track of them
and keep me posted.

343
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:29,583
We got some unusual cloud
activity. Fold up your parasol.

344
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,958
No problem. What do we
do about those two?

345
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,625
If their beacon's on,
we can find them anytime.

346
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,833
Worst case scenario,

347
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,833
we blast those guys
and then pick them up.

348
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,750
Hail Überführer!

349
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:43,916
Based on a communications
check using radio interception,

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,083
we confirm there are no
naval vessels in the vicinity.

351
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,916
Therefore, we can only conclude
that these are hated bandits

352
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,041
who are plundering
this sacred gravesite.

353
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,375
Your decision please, Commander.

354
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,791
These plunderers
are such fools.

355
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,750
The proof of inheritance
of this gravesite

356
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,458
is rightfully and
indisputably ours.

357
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,041
Very well, Squad Commander. 

358
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:06,208
I will allow destruction
with an iron fist.

359
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,500
[BENNY] Hmm, what's going on?

360
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,333
Dutch. I'm seeing movement.

361
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,625
Okay. I'm just
starting the engines.

362
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,166
That's strange.
What are they doing?

363
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,083
Dutch, it's a TOW!

364
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:32,250
Damn it! I shoulda known
that's what they'd do!

365
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,958
Hang on, Benny!

366
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,333
Damn it! Fucking
anti-tank missiles!

367
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:46,791
That's it. Run away,
degenerationists.

368
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,708
For this is our destined
reunion with Brunhilda!

369
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,958
No one will stop us!

370
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,833
[ROCK] This underwater tomb
is about to open.

371
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:51,958
[REVY] You'll no longer
be one of us.

372
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,041
When that happens,
I'm gonna kill you.
