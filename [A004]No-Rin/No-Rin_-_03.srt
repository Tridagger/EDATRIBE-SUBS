1
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:03,817
I am so tired.

2
00:00:03,906 --> 00:00:07,865
Changing outta these clothes and grabbing
some dinner sounds awesome right about now.

3
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:13,258
Where are my Yukatan posters?!

4
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,584
My Yukatan wall scrolls?! My Yukatan body pillow?!

5
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,763
My Yukata DVD and BluRay collection?!

6
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:20,329
My scrapbook of Yukatan-related news articles?!

7
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,709
Yeah, Dumped them in the furnace.

8
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:29,881
Don't say I never do nothing for you.

9
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:32,386
What would possess you to burn my posters?!

10
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:34,292
Hey! Would you feel comfortable in a room

11
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,675
with pictures of you all over the damn wall?!

12
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:40,104
I did you a favor so your dream girl won't freak out.

13
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:41,751
She doesn't need to know how obsessed you are.

14
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,709
And besides, your mom begged me to do something.

15
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:45,334
I promised her I'd watch your back out here,

16
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,126
so get used to it.

17
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:47,736
Well. You could've asked.

18
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,209
Don't read too much into it 'cause just so you know

19
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:52,042
I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure

20
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:54,202
you never hook up with that little slut.

21
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:56,001
Believe me, I know why she's here.

22
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:58,167
And if Little Miss Pop Sensation
thinks this is the place

23
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,792
to stink up her would-be green thumb,

24
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,251
she's got another thing coming!

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,467
That doesn't even make sense.

26
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:03,275
Oh, doesn't it?!

27
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,709
Whatever, who cares?!

28
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,876
Her first time working the farm is
supposed to be tomorrow morning, correct?

29
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:08,900
I think so.

30
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,705
Well, Her Highness is due for a trial by fire!

31
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:12,803
Hmph!

32
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:14,585
Alrighty then.

33
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,175
Does that mean what I think it does?!

34
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,498
'Cause if the girl I've known
since we were playing doctor

35
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,059
has it in for the girl who made my gonads drop...

36
00:01:19,084 --> 00:01:20,767
Not that I'm proud of this, but the whole thing might be

37
00:01:20,792 --> 00:01:22,559
a little too hot for me to handle.

38
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:04,660
Huh. I give her credit for even bothering to show up.

39
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:05,380
Yeah?

40
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:08,487
Well if she knew you were planning to put her
through her paces, she probably wouldn't have.

41
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,209
Of all the days for Kei to be out on a
welding gig for shop class. This is balls.

42
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,201
I will own this whore!

43
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:19,358
Why do I always end up having to
deal with this crap by myself?

44
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:20,963
That didn't take long.

45
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:22,139
Don't be shy.

46
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,636
C'mon down and show us all how you look in the uniform.

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,251
Sure thing.

48
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,959
What the hell is wrong with you?!

49
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,722
She looks like... She looks like a tentacle magnet!

50
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:37,373
Huh.

51
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,051
Must've given her the wrong outfit.

52
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:40,517
In what way exactly does that suit

53
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:42,084
of comic-shop stripper-pole armor look anything

54
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:43,501
like one of our work uniforms?!

55
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:45,667
I know what you're up to and it's just wrong!

56
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:47,778
Ugh. What I'm up to is for her own good. Hmph.

57
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,542
She can't work in that!

58
00:03:49,626 --> 00:03:51,142
She'd better learn how quick,

59
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:53,240
'cause the first test she's
got is coping with distraction!

60
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,513
If she wants to work the earth,

61
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,209
she's got to get over caring how she looks!

62
00:03:56,262 --> 00:03:59,326
All the more reason not to stuff her
into something out of an online fan fic!

63
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,885
This whole thing is ridiculous,
I'm putting my foot down!

64
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,091
I'm okay.

65
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,542
See? She's down with this.

66
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:05,370
Now then.

67
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:07,859
Just to show you I'm a good sport...

68
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:13,501
Yup. Say hi-di-ho to girl power!

69
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,392
Hyah!

70
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:15,377
Hey!

71
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:15,940
Wha... ?!

72
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:16,983
Whoa-whoa!

73
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:17,917
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

74
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:21,159
I... can't... take it!

75
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,550
Whoa. This is so hot!

76
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,629
Yeah, no. Rein it in there a bit, tiger.

77
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,500
Huh? Wait. No! That just came out!

78
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:33,212
Hmph.

79
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:36,060
Heh! You know, Miss Kinoshita,

80
00:04:36,122 --> 00:04:38,178
if you're self-conscious you can back out now.

81
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:39,532
Like hell.

82
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,412
Of course.

83
00:04:44,042 --> 00:04:45,598
Holy crap, it's a Paladin!

84
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:48,710
Or just Kei. Seriously, dude? A suit of armor?

85
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,770
I thought you were supposed to be out welding.

86
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:53,263
I felt a disturbance in the force.

87
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,766
And I like to watch.

88
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,488
Welcome to the Cucumber House.

89
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,309
Hey, Yukatan. Can I get an autograph?

90
00:05:05,334 --> 00:05:06,959
Screw her, man, look at this one!

91
00:05:07,042 --> 00:05:08,822
Now that's some produce!

92
00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:10,947
The First job's a cinch.

93
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,476
All you have to do is check the leaves for diseases

94
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,481
and what not. See any bugs having a party,

95
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:16,876
you pick 'em off. Understood?

96
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,959
I'll play nice and give you the row on the left.

97
00:05:19,042 --> 00:05:20,251
One on the right's mine.

98
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:22,126
Battle starts when Kousaku says go.

99
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,667
If he can do it without drooling.

100
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:25,209
Wait, why me?

101
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,532
Go on. It's the easiest job in the world, I promise.

102
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,376
Okay fine, whatever. Just do it.

103
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,770
And they're off! In full cosplay!

104
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,876
Minori's a sneaky one when she wants to be.

105
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,638
Huh?

106
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:39,318
Don't get me wrong,

107
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,851
cucumber's a beginner plant, sure. We all know that,

108
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,251
it's just...

109
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:44,959
If you're not ready for the prickly bits on the leaves

110
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,501
and stems, that stuff can sting like a mother.

111
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,542
Are you saying Minori put her in bikini armor

112
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,417
on purpose to get her pricked?!

113
00:05:51,501 --> 00:05:53,959
Minori knows her cucumber; she's used to it.

114
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,660
City gal like Ringo, though.

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,209
I'd say she's in for a rude awakening.

116
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:01,172
Wow. Look at her go! She's a demon!

117
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,455
Game over, man.

118
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,929
Wait. No. Not yet.

119
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,934
Not until Minori wipes the floor with her.

120
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,832
Ahh... Oh, right. I totally forgot.

121
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,251
Yuka may be naturally immune to the prickly bits.

122
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,792
But what about the caterpillars?

123
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:18,876
Bingo.

124
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,001
Those things make even

125
00:06:20,026 --> 00:06:21,931
a seasoned cumcumber-er's skin crawl.

126
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,169
And now we see what she's made of.

127
00:06:27,503 --> 00:06:30,226
No! She's too wet behind the ears for this!

128
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:33,930
Get an eyeful of those cute little
buggy-wuggies and bawl yourself sick.

129
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:36,501
"Um. Bye, everybody: I'm going back to the Big City

130
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:38,958
where the only insects I have to worry about are flies!"

131
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,448
Whooa!

132
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:47,001
Oh snap. Keinez the Catalyst goes Oratorio!

133
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,876
That's what you call the power of bikini armor, guys!

134
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:56,834
Of course! Ringo's never seen a caterpillar before!

135
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:58,633
How would she know to be grossed out by one?!

136
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,263
She's too innocent and pure
to realize how vile they are!

137
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,358
Oh my glob, this is amazing!

138
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,167
Whoa! She's closing the distance
between them like nobody's business!

139
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,094
Nice try, sister,

140
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,751
but I didn'tt sign on to be
the laughing stock of my peers!

141
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,626
Clear! Clear!

142
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,542
Clear-clear-clear-clear-clear-
clear-clear-clear-clear...!

143
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,380
Clear!

144
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,167
Photo finish!

145
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:22,858
Nuh-uh, dude: Nakazawa won by a nose!

146
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:30,834
Bag, please.

147
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:34,468
Heh! Yeah, well don't rest on your laurels just yet.

148
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,208
This battle is far from over.

149
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,353
Next up, we have the Hen House!

150
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:45,917
Alongside rice farming, cleaning the chicken coops

151
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:48,751
is the most important part of a
freshman Ag student's training.

152
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,751
If you can handle what's on the other side of that door,

153
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:51,963
you can handle anything.

154
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:58,792
Good luck in there!

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,089
Hens are a barnyard predator's dream.

156
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,626
If we didn't keep them penned up,

157
00:08:02,653 --> 00:08:05,209
we'd have nothing but bones and feathers come morning.

158
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:09,505
The coops are great, but the downside
is they're humid and, well, cooped.

159
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:13,251
First one of us to make the floor shine
without losing her lunch takes home the gold!

160
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,319
Feathers got to go. Food scraps got to go.

161
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:16,399
Poop's got to go.

162
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,041
And if feathers, food scraps,
and poop are too much for you,

163
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,076
you've got to go.

164
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,017
Whoa! It's nothing to her.

165
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,532
She's acclimated to the smell!

166
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:30,458
Don't call it yet!

167
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:31,667
We're still just getting started!

168
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:32,487
That's right.

169
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,251
The putrid aroma is only the
beginning of her season in hell!

170
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:37,792
The smell you deal with. The heat you deal with.

171
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:38,792
But then...

172
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,006
Abandon all hope ye who enter here!

173
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,751
Oh. Hey, hon? I love the energy,

174
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,042
but I think you might've overlooked something important.

175
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,874
Can't forget about the feed stall, can we?

176
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,334
Aah!

177
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,834
Whoa!

178
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,347
Aaagh!

179
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:02,209
It's like a cockroach Armageddon
every time we open that door!

180
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,584
Just think about it, man:

181
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,084
Darkness, humidity, an all-you-can eat poop buffet.

182
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:07,417
This is paradise for them!

183
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:10,267
That's right!

184
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,584
Dealing with cockroaches is part of the job!

185
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,126
Admit defeat and I'll help you clean them out.

186
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,938
Ewww! She's stepping on them!

187
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,350
I'm going to say what we're all thinking

188
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,493
and call this beyond gross.

189
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:34,851
Disqualification! Y-You're supposed to be freaking out!

190
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:35,903
Sorry.

191
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,251
So, is that it?

192
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,126
And the winner is, Ringo Kinoshita!

193
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:48,834
Huh?!

194
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:49,959
Nice.

195
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:51,830
No! Not yet! She isn't done!

196
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:53,792
Minori, please. Give it up.

197
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,626
We still have to test her most basic agricultural skill!

198
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,140
Trial by Rice Field!

199
00:09:58,924 --> 00:09:59,924
Rice field?

200
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,759
Oh, yes!

201
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:03,113
Rice has been a vital part of the Rising Sun experience

202
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:04,459
since the Yayoi Period!

203
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,267
You can't claim to know what it is to be Japanese

204
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,834
until you've gotten your feet wet! I defy you to try!

205
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:11,417
Only after you've mastered our landscaping and

206
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:13,727
dietary epicenter will I allow
you to count yourself worthy!

207
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,251
Uh. Don't oversell it.

208
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,126
Or, stop talking outta your ass.

209
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:19,834
Argue all you want. History is on my side!

210
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:20,699
But don't worry.

211
00:10:20,724 --> 00:10:22,667
Back out now and I'll spare you the embarrassment!

212
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,542
Bring it.

213
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:25,167
Someone's feeling feisty, huh?

214
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:28,458
All-righty, then.

215
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,700
So, meet at the rice fields Saturday morning

216
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:32,917
dressed in clothes you don't mind getting water-logged.

217
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,817
Woo-hoo.

218
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,553
This field's roughly one tenth of a hectare.

219
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,345
That's about a thousand square meters.

220
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:42,614
It takes four people half a day to plant rice.

221
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:46,182
Hah! Prepare to watch me set a new world record, losers!

222
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:49,554
Um. Before we get started I'd like to clarify something.

223
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,642
Usually when you're about to take the plunge.

224
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,449
It's a good idea to dress in
clothes appropriate to the task.

225
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:57,475
But, uh... Seriously, you guys, this is just...

226
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,859
I mean, c'mon.

227
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:00,945
Sorry. Should I change?

228
00:11:01,298 --> 00:11:02,709
Nah, it's okay. No worries.

229
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,167
You definitely rack up points for thinking ahead.

230
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,792
And looking fly!

231
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:08,436
You, however!

232
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,198
What's wrong?

233
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,542
What do you mean "What's
wrong?" Have you seen yourself?!

234
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:13,792
I mean, okay, yes, technically it is a bathing suit,

235
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,817
so it qualifies as appropriate
for getting wet in and all.

236
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,584
But, other than that,
nothing about what you have on isn't wrong!

237
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:20,376
I can't un-see this, man! Not cool!

238
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,379
Well you'd be the first to want to un-see it.

239
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,740
Don't even! That's just...

240
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,821
Where do you go that people encourage this?!

241
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:28,759
Let's just say somewhere popular.

242
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:30,126
And sopping wet.

243
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:31,892
Mah! Never mind, dude!

244
00:11:31,917 --> 00:11:33,948
Everybody loves to see the Gaisenmon.

245
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:35,371
Whoa, highbrow!

246
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,452
That's like a French English play on words, bro.

247
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,834
It's a combo of English for dude
and French for Arc of Triumph!

248
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,209
That's why Kei's a trailblazer

249
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,834
and we're just a couple of followers!

250
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,376
I'm just happy we get to bask in his presence!

251
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,122
Look, Kei.

252
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:49,334
I'm not trying to tell you what to wear, but...

253
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,420
I mean we got to consider the ladies, right?

254
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,626
Poor Ringo doesn't need to...

255
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,626
Give me a second, I'm in the middle of something.

256
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:56,834
Kei is a living god!

257
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,292
Wait, don't encourage him!

258
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:00,215
Hey! I see you there!

259
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,733
That's the point, silly!

260
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,034
Has the world gone mad?

261
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,626
This is an Ag school, you're a teacher here!

262
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,966
Why would you wear something like that to farm in?

263
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:10,219
Oh, sweetie.

264
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:12,126
Wedding dresses are meant to get soiled.

265
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,608
I'ma need you to not elaborate on that, please!

266
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,452
Uh-oh. Have I crossed a line? I'm such a naughty girl.

267
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:21,183
Somebody really needs to teach the teacher a lesson.

268
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,966
Okay, you're like a hundred
years old and that's super bleh.

269
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,876
But the experts say I'm at my peak.

270
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,834
Stop hitting on your students and go home!

271
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:28,981
We don't need you to supervise!

272
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:30,501
Oh stop playing hard to get:

273
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,292
this is every teenage boy's fantasy.

274
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,626
I just want to plant rice!

275
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,751
Why is that so difficult to let me do?!

276
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,376
I don't need this! I don't deserve this!

277
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:41,084
You'll never sow your seed in
a field wetter than this MILF,

278
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,292
lover boy!!

279
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,542
How has the school board not
axed you twice-over by now?!

280
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:47,876
Whooaa...

281
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,417
You're only a MILF if you actually have children!

282
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:53,156
Thank you. That was, uh, that was getting kind of weird.

283
00:12:53,516 --> 00:12:56,108
Hmm. Meh. Minori's got your back.

284
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:59,059
Hey, Minori? What're those?

285
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:02,261
What? Bloomers.

286
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:03,323
Wait...

287
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:05,342
Did you...?

288
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:08,911
Behold.

289
00:13:09,437 --> 00:13:13,829
A deeper shade of blue than
sky on a Spring Afternoon. Wow.

290
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,267
Okay, I'm not trying to say they're hideous or anything.

291
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,959
But what's the story with these things?

292
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,501
You've read the student handbook, right?

293
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,084
Girls are supposed to wear shorts.

294
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,251
It's no big deal.

295
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,209
I had them sent to me special for today.

296
00:13:26,292 --> 00:13:26,959
No joke?!

297
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,226
Whoa! Historic!

298
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:30,584
I can't remember the last time I saw a pair like these.

299
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,236
Didn't know they were still a thing.

300
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,059
They're not new or anything.

301
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,251
Just a hand-me-down from my sisters.

302
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,209
Damn it, Minori, what is wrong with you?!

303
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:38,655
What?

304
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:41,159
I was adjusting the hem to cover up a mosquito bite.

305
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,552
Well, it's mighty suggestive!
When you're dressed like that,

306
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:44,876
there's just some things you can't do!

307
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,251
Hems have been playing fast and loose

308
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,660
with men's short-term memory since the caveman days!

309
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:51,657
The bloomers are too much! Disqualification!

310
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,264
Control yourself for five minutes

311
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:55,439
and they wouldn't be an issue.

312
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:56,343
Creep.

313
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,976
Whoa, whoa! Don't turn this into a feminist rant.

314
00:13:59,001 --> 00:13:59,851
You chose them!

315
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:01,161
Deal with it, pervert!

316
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,246
Wait. What the...  What do you think you're doing?!

317
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:11,033
Yeah! Show us some of that sweet swimsuit action!

318
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:14,185
School swim team uniform.

319
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:17,036
Bold choice. Very "kyu-suku."

320
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,292
Kyu-suku?

321
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:19,616
Now listen closely.

322
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,414
Kyu-suku refers to a popular old style swimsuit.

323
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,001
The distinguishing feature of
its design is the crotch area

324
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:27,792
being divided into two discreet regions.

325
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,542
This ingenious shape allowed the wearer

326
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:32,167
greater flexibility both in and outside of the pool.

327
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,626
it also protected the susceptible

328
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,876
female nether regions from getting water-logged.

329
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,417
Form and function combined to
make a truly wonderful thing.

330
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,501
Yep, this beaut was a game-changer.

331
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,024
Wow. You guys know water sports.

332
00:14:43,793 --> 00:14:45,542
Well, either way I'm a fan of the style.

333
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:48,270
It's just the right balance of functional and girlie.

334
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:49,876
And I know nothing about fashion.

335
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,438
I'm just shooting from the hip.

336
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:52,708
Don't look at me like that.

337
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,709
My bad! I, uh...

338
00:14:54,792 --> 00:14:56,459
I just think you look great in that.

339
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:58,126
I mean it totally suits your curves.

340
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,667
Kind of makes you look like a model.

341
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,626
You... pervert.

342
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:05,668
Forgive me! I won't look anymore promise!

343
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:06,731
Chauvinist!

344
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,751
Please. Ladies, you got to stop this.

345
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,292
The landscape students are gawking.

346
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,917
Is it too much to ask that we all just get along?

347
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,310
Stay out of it!

348
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:25,084
Okay, look, I'm only trying to point out

349
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,976
that we're about to start the whole rice-planting thing,

350
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,751
so it's probably best if everyone lets bygones

351
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,977
be bygones.

352
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:33,731
Ready when you are.

353
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,427
Alrighty, folks!

354
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:44,292
Let's get this show on the road and start cultivating!

355
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:49,542
Pay no attention to that.

356
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:51,126
Only a little mud between the toes.

357
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,292
You'll get used to it.

358
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,917
You might even find it kind of pleasant.

359
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:54,895
Oh, okay.

360
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,751
First up: Let me show you how to plant properly.

361
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:05,417
You're really good at this.

362
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,417
Huh? You... You think so?

363
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:09,992
Around here, Kousaku's the man when it comes to rice.

364
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,167
His technique is legendary.

365
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:13,334
True fact: in class,

366
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,584
the teachers don't hold a candle to him.

367
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,626
Yeah. Back home, they all used to call me

368
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,209
"the rice cultivating mad man."

369
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:21,330
No worries. It's not as hard as it looks.

370
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,001
I call foul!

371
00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,680
In case you haven't noticed,
we're trying to run a race here.

372
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:28,849
This is hardly the time for one-on-one instruction!

373
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,448
Not so fast! Girl's got a right to be taught.

374
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:34,332
I say let him. We want a fair competition.

375
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:37,414
He can give her everything she
needs to know in a few minutes.

376
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:40,397
Fine then, teach her your "legendary technique." But!

377
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,546
You'd better not be stalling for time!

378
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:43,516
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:46,187
Let's see what you got. Can you do it like I showed you?

380
00:16:46,345 --> 00:16:47,135
Yes.

381
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:52,009
Not too shabby, but you got to stick
it down in the mud a tiny bit deeper.

382
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:55,151
See, the way you've got it in
there now it'll get washed away.

383
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:55,854
So...?

384
00:16:56,209 --> 00:16:56,952
Deeper.

385
00:16:58,706 --> 00:16:59,540
Watch me.

386
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:02,459
You see how far I'm putting it down in there? Bam.

387
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,126
We have to make sure the roots are supported well. Yeah?

388
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,792
It's kind of hard to see.

389
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:07,917
Sure. Kind of.

390
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,251
Ugh! Come on already! Let's go!

391
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,434
Miss Becky could get a date in half the time.

392
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,358
Just look at her!

393
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,834
Any longer and the poor woman is going to shrivel up!

394
00:17:15,878 --> 00:17:17,442
Take it from me: life is cruel.

395
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:20,001
Idea. Why don't you two race as a team?

396
00:17:20,076 --> 00:17:21,661
She leads, you come from behind.

397
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:22,686
Yeah, but for that to work,

398
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:23,917
our bodies will have to be touching...

399
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,334
Actually, what am I complaining about?

400
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,713
This is a solid plan. I'm excited to be a part of it.

401
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,812
Wait! I'm not liking this! What is it teaching her?

402
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,501
Minori, give it a rest.

403
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,126
At the end of the day, she's here to learn,

404
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,390
not worry about whether you
think she can pass the muster.

405
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,881
This is just too... ! Look at this thought bubble!

406
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:41,973
They're basically spooning,
how can I be comfortable with that?

407
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,551
Ringo. Are you okay with touching?

408
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,130
Sure.

409
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,143
Seriously?!

410
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,401
This won't come back to bite me in the ass?!

411
00:17:50,511 --> 00:17:51,056
Nope.

412
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:51,749
Wait.

413
00:17:51,796 --> 00:17:54,390
"Nope, not seriously" or "nope" as in "we're" cool?

414
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,212
Bah! I'm in either way!

415
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,384
'Kay, so...

416
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:11,354
Look out below, mud's slippery! Timber!

417
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,612
Oh, I'm such a klutz!

418
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:14,758
Not as sure on my feet as I thought I was.

419
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:16,667
Maybe I need some one-on-one tutoring.

420
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:17,751
Do you charge, or what?

421
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:19,501
Uh, in case you haven't noticed, Minori,

422
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:20,811
we're trying to run a race here.

423
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:22,063
Asshole.

424
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,542
All right. Since Miss Kinoshita is the beginner,

425
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,084
we'll start her from there.

426
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,834
Miss Nakazawa, being the expert,
will start slightly behind.

427
00:18:33,917 --> 00:18:35,792
The big moment is almost upon us.

428
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:37,126
The tension in the air is thick.

429
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,313
Welcome to the No-Rin Rice Planting Cup.

430
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,543
Kousaku and myself will be your hosts.

431
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,046
Thank you, it's good to be here.

432
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,862
We're waiting for Miss Becky to do the honors.

433
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:47,349
Ready.

434
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,542
Go!!

435
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,639
Man, look at her go!

436
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:02,292
Nakazawa has started strong.

437
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,834
But will that breakneck pace
take her to the finish line?

438
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,876
Bear in mind, Kei,
the girl has a reputation for stamina.

439
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:11,408
And it's clear she intends to use it
to bring the heat down on her opponent.

440
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,626
One has to question what Kinoshita's plans are

441
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:14,959
once the two are neck and neck.

442
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,621
Come on!

443
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,899
Conserve your energy or you're
going to burn yourself out!

444
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,727
Yeah-yeah! Go, Ringo!

445
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,917
Slow and steady wins the race!

446
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,501
What the challenger lacks in speed

447
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:26,542
she makes up for in attention to detail.

448
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,667
You know, at the end of the day, with a view like this

449
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,417
it doesn't even matter who brings it home.

450
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,792
How does that work?

451
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,126
Give it a ponder, man!

452
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:37,264
For centuries men have been in one of two camps:

453
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,209
You dig that ass, you're a perv.

454
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,751
Ta-tas and you're a mama's boy.

455
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,792
Brothers have been killing
each other over the difference

456
00:19:42,876 --> 00:19:43,611
since forever!

457
00:19:43,636 --> 00:19:44,316
He's right!

458
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,417
This competition is like a peace treaty!

459
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,876
Whoa-ho!

460
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:48,834
Bloomers!

461
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:49,834
Swimsuit!

462
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:50,775
Bootay!

463
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:51,768
Ta-tas!

464
00:19:51,793 --> 00:19:53,059
There's something for everyone!

465
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,126
No longer must a man choose!

466
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:58,584
Nakazawa is swiftly closing the gap!

467
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,617
It's only a matter of moments before she takes the lead!

468
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:03,779
Stop glaring. Just give up.

469
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:04,887
No way.

470
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,042
Look, deny all you want but I'm telling you:

471
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,417
It's time you make peace with the fact

472
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,209
you're not cut out for this lifestyle.

473
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,459
Whatever you say.

474
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,417
Alright. That's it. You're through!

475
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,428
Oops. Sorry.

476
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:28,459
Ha! Hey, no worries. Accidents happen.

477
00:20:28,542 --> 00:20:30,959
Occupational hazard when you're a stupid slut!

478
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:42,624
Jackass.

479
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:45,876
Oh, that's it! I'm done playing nice with you!

480
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,792
You stupid little hussy! You're going down!

481
00:20:53,876 --> 00:20:56,001
Quit being such a bitch.

482
00:20:56,084 --> 00:20:58,292
I'll show you bitch, bitch!

483
00:20:58,348 --> 00:21:00,084
And it looks like they've gone from rice planting

484
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,542
to mud wrestling! We've got a spank fight!

485
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:06,005
I'd say so. I don't know about
you, Kei, but I'm riveted.

486
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,167
We should probably stop them.

487
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,417
You've had your fun, ladies!

488
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,084
Stop trampling the rice field!

489
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,459
Damn but this is hot!

490
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,834
Get away from me!

491
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,584
This was a bad idea!

492
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,417
That all you got, jail bait?

493
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:22,751
Bring it, Bloomers!

494
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:35,744
Oh, boy.

495
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,450
You know, you're actually pretty good.

496
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,509
Not as good as you.

497
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,635
It's funny sometimes, the things that'll make

498
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,362
two people want to bury the hatchet.

499
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,297
That's life for you, I guess.

500
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:03,398
Oh, don't worry. I re-planted the rice the next day.

501
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,001
Not with Miss Becky.

502
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:38,448
"The Smile You Showed Me."
