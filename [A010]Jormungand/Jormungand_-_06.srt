1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,250
- Koko: MOVE! MOVE!
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,958
ENEMY SIGHTED! PREPARE
FOR COMBAT IMMEDIATELY.

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,500
DO YOU COPY ME?

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,125
- YEAH, I COPY.
- THEY'VE GOT SHARP EYES.

5
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,708
I DON'T WANT THEM CATCHING ON

6
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,875
TILL THEY'RE RIGHT
WHERE WE WANT 'EM.

7
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:22,166
NO WAY THIS IS THE ONLY BOAT
THEY'VE GOT.

8
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,791
TOJO, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

9
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,791
- I DO HAVE EYES
ON ANOTHER BOAT APPROACHING.

10
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,000
THREE KILOMETERS
BEHIND HOSTILE ONE.

11
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,875
E.T.A. 60 SECONDS.
- DAMN PIRATES!

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:36,000
YOU JUST MADE THE WORST DECISION
OF YOUR MISERABLE LIVES!

13
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,166
- EVERYONE LIVES
IF YOU DROP ANCHOR NOW!

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,916
- KEEP DREAMING, ASSHAT!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,875
- ( theme music playing )

16
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,500
- ( singing in Japanese )

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,208
- Koko: GREAT JOB SPOTTING THOSE
BASTARDS SO QUICKLY, VALMET.

18
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,125
I CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON YOU.

19
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,083
- ( laughs ) FOR YOU, KOKO,

20
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:20,166
I WOULD LOOK TO THE VERY ENDS
OF THE EARTH--

21
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,291
- GUYS, INCOMING CHOPPER

22
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,541
IN ADDITION TO
HOSTILES ONE AND TWO.

23
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,125
WHAT I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IS WHAT THESE LOWLIFES ARE DOING

24
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,333
WITH SUCH ADVANCED WEAPONRY.

25
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,208
- ( helicopter blades whirring )

26
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,375
- SHE'S RIGHT.
I CAN HEAR THE HELICOPTER NOW.

27
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,000
- Jonah: WE'VE GOT
A SMALL BUT FAST CRAFT

28
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,250
APPROACHING FROM BEHIND.

29
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,291
- ROGER THAT.
WE'RE UP TO THREE HOSTILES NOW.

30
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:49,375
UGO, PORTSIDE.
HIT HOSTILE THREE WITH AN R.P.G.

31
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:52,000
JONAH,
STAY DOWN UNTIL IT HITS.

32
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:54,583
HOSTILES TWO AND THREE
ARE THEIR PRIMARY CRAFT.

33
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,166
THEY'LL LIKELY TRY AND SEND UP
THEIR GOONS TO SEIZE THE SHIP.

34
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,291
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN, ARE WE?

35
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,333
GOT A VISUAL ON THE COPTER.

36
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,250
IT'S A DENEL AVIATION ORYX,

37
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,333
SO WATCH OUT
FOR THE 80mm ROCKETS.

38
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,875
DON'T LET THAT BASTARD FIRE!

39
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:15,625
- ( rap song playing )

40
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:25,166
- Man: WHA--

41
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,125
HOW THE HELL
IS A FREIGHTER FIRING ON US?

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,458
HUH?

43
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,833
- HOLY SHIT,
THEY TOOK OUT THE COMMAND BOAT!

44
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,958
- PULL BACK! THEY GOT A GUY
AIMING AT US, PORTSIDE!

45
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,250
R.P.G.!

46
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,083
- ( gun cocks )

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,250
- Koko:
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

48
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,041
FINISH THEM OFF, LEHM!
- SEE YA, BOYS.

49
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,041
- Jonah:
THE LITTLE SHIT PUNCHED ME.

50
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,958
I SAVED HIS MISERABLE LIFE
AND HE PUNCHED ME.

51
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,791
SO, YEAH.

52
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,250
- ( all laughing ) 

53
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,958
- ( speaks native language )

54
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,250
- KOKO'S ALWAYS PRETTY MERCILESS

55
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,125
WHEN IT COMES TO
DEALING WITH PIRATES.

56
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,166
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,166
I GAVE HIM A LIFE PRESERVER.

58
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,958
HOW IS THAT MERCILESS?

59
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,875
WELL, WE SHOULD MAKE PORT
IN SOUTH AFRICA BEFORE LONG.

60
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,833
- Valmet: AFRICA.

61
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:32,625
- Scarecrow:
OOH, IS THAT A COHIBA?

62
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,291
OR WAS IT MADE IN CHINA?

63
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,958
ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS.
ONCE I'VE GOT MY HOOKS IN YOU,

64
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,666
THAT'LL BE THE END OF FANCY
CIGARS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

65
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,291
YOU'VE BEEN A BAD BOY.

66
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,958
- NOW, SCARECROW,
SURELY YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

67
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,500
I CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON

68
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,500
I SHOULD COMMAND YOUR
ATTENTION LIKE THIS.

69
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,416
- REALLY? 
LET'S START WITH YOUR PLACE

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,916
IN THE DA XINGHAI
TRADING COMPANY.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,333
GUOMING CHEN,
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.

72
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,791
YOU IMPORT SEEMINGLY LEGIT
MACHINERY TO AFRICA

73
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,333
AND THEN YOU EXPORT
LOADS OF RAW MINERALS.

74
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:09,666
TO MOST PEOPLE, IT LOOKS LIKE

75
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,166
A SUCCESSFUL,
ABOVE-BOARD BUSINESS.

76
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,625
BUT I AIN'T FOOLED.

77
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,333
YOU SEE, I GOT THIS NOSE
FOR DIRTY MONEY.

78
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,750
AND THE CASH
YOU'VE BEEN HAULING IN

79
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,333
DOESN'T SMELL SO SWEET TO ME.

80
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,500
YOU'RE IN THE ARMS TRADE,
AREN'T YA?

81
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,958
NOT THAT I THINK YOU'D EVER
PERSONALLY GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY,

82
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,166
BUT YOUR LADY FRIEND
OVER THERE

83
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,041
SEEMS TO BE WEARING
EAU DE GUN OIL.

84
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,166
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU AMERICANS.

85
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,083
YOU PUT SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY
INTO MAKING A SINGLE JOKE.

86
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,333
- YEAH, SEE,
WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU,

87
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:42,125
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
FIND ANY OF THIS FUNNY.

88
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,333
IN FACT, WHEN DEALING
WITH US AMERICANS,

89
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,583
I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO--

90
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,125
- ( cell phone rings )
- OH, CRAP, THAT'S ME.

91
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,000
BASICALLY,
DON'T SCREW WITH US.

92
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,875
I'M STEPPING OUT FOR A SEC.
YOU STAY HERE.

93
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,458
I STILL GOT PLENTY OF QUESTIONS
THAT NEED ANSWERS.

94
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,375
ABOUT YOUR CONNECTION
TO KASPER HEKMATYAR, FOR ONE.

95
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,375
NEED PERSUADING?

96
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,458
JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS FINE FELLOW.

97
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,166
ELITE P.M.C. MUSCLE,
WORKIN' FOR ME.

98
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,375
YOU WANT TO DO SO MUCH
AS TAKE A PISS,

99
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,625
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH HIM
TO GET THERE.

100
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:12,916
- ( door opens )
- HEY, AHMAD, WHAT'S UP?

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,541
GOT SOME DIRT ON KOKO FOR ME?
IT'S ABOUT DAMN TIME!

102
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,791
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

103
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,833
WHAT DO YOU NEED?
THE BATHROOM?

104
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,125
OH!

105
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,208
- Scarecrow: ATLAS, ATLAS.
THAT UKRAINIAN CONTAINER SHIP?

106
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:40,250
AND IT UNLOADED OVER HALF
ITS CARGO AT THE FIRST PORT?

107
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,416
MISSILES, HUH?

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,416
( laughs ) THAT CROOK.

109
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,916
YEAH, KEEP GOING.
- ( grunting )

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,416
- ( bones cracking,
man grunting )

111
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,375
- ENOUGH.

112
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,416
DON'T KILL HIM, KAREN.
IT MIGHT CAUSE PROBLEMS.

113
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,375
- ALL RIGHT, SIR.
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

114
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,541
YOUR CANE.

115
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,375
- ( grunts )

116
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:07,166
UM, YOU'VE GOT
A LITTLE SOMETHING ON YOUR FACE.

117
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,958
- I'LL VISIT THE POWDER ROOM,
GENERAL.

118
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,958
THANK YOU.

119
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,375
- WAIT.
- ( coins dropping )

120
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
- THE CAPTAIN OF THE UNIT

121
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,833
ASKED FOR AN ADDITIONAL
CONTAINER'S WORTH?

122
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,750
AND THEY JUST FILLED THE ORDER,
RIGHT THEN AND THERE?

123
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,583
REALLY?
WITHOUT A MONEY TRANSFER?

124
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,208
SO HE JUST HANDED OVER
SOME DIAMONDS?

125
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,000
SERIOUSLY?
DIAMONDS?

126
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,625
( laughs )
- ( door opens )

127
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,583
- HEY, YOU!  GET BACK--

128
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,333
( sighs )

129
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:45,958
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?

130
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,958
I'M NOT PAYING YOU
TO GET YOUR ASS BEAT.

131
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:51,500
WHAT?  THE WOMAN?
DUDE, THAT IS FUCKING PATHETIC!

132
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,041
- WHERE'S THE UNIT?

133
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,125
- SIR, THEY WERE TOLD TO ARRIVE
IN SOUTH AFRICA AHEAD OF US.

134
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,125
- THE SUCCESS OF THIS OPERATION
HAD BETTER EXCEED

135
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,875
THE INCONVENIENCE
OF THAT MEETING.

136
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,750
FAILURE IS NO OPTION.

137
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,583
- KASPER.

138
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,625
IT WON'T BE MUCH LONGER NOW.

139
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,583
- ( knocking )
- Mokoena: HELLO?  DR. MIAMI?

140
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,500
ARE YOU IN THERE, DOC?
OPEN UP.

141
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,750
( sighs )

142
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,541
- ( Miami humming )

143
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,208
♪ O, TWILIGHT BUTTERFLY ♪

144
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,083
♪ HOW YOU FLY SO HIGH ♪

145
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,500
♪ ABOVE THE RAIN AND CLOUDS
SOARING, YOU AND I... ♪

146
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,833
- THIS WOULD BE A LOT EASIER

147
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,458
IF YOU WOULD ANSWER
WHEN I KNOCK.

148
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,000
- WHAT?
OH, HELLO.

149
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,625
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE THERE, MOKOENA.

150
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,291
YOU STARTLED ME.
HANG ON, WHERE'S ALL YOUR GEAR?

151
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,500
SHOULDN'T YOU BE READY
TO LEAVE BY NOW?

152
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
- ACTUALLY,
THAT'S THE REASON I'M HERE.

153
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,083
YOU JUST UP
AND ANNOUNCED

154
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,666
THAT YOU WERE HEADING
TO THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON.

155
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,833
I CAME BY TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE NOT SERIOUS.

156
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,541
BUT I WAS WRONG.
YOU CAN'T GO.

157
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,708
YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT
THE EXPO TOMORROW AT 10:00 A.M.

158
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:24,125
WITH KOKO HEKMATYAR OF H.C.L.I.

159
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:27,916
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
- YEAH, KOKO.
THAT LUCKY GIRL.

161
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,750
WE'RE THE SAME AGE, BUT SHE
LOOKS SO MUCH YOUNGER THAN ME.

162
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,833
SORRY, KOKO!

163
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,875
I CAN'T MAKE IT.  OH!
- HUH?

164
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:49,000
- IT'S BECAUSE OF THE
BUTTERFLIES! THE BUTTERFLIES!

165
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,416
AHH!

166
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,583
- I HAD A FEELING
THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS ABOUT.

167
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,750
- Koko: DR. MIAMI, HUH?

168
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,791
YOU THINK SHE STILL
SPENDS ALL HER TIME

169
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,083
CHASING AFTER BUTTERFLIES?
- PROBABLY SO.

170
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,500
SHE DOES HAVE AN ABNORMAL
OBSESSION WITH THEM.

171
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,791
SHE'S AN OFFICER

172
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,541
IN SOME WORLDWIDE
BUTTERFLY GROUP, APPARENTLY.

173
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,416
THAT'S WHO WE'RE
MEETING TOMORROW--

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,833
PROFESSOR MINAMI AMADA,
A.K.A. DR. MIAMI.

175
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,583
SHE'S CURRENTLY IN SOUTH AFRICA

176
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,125
WORKING WITH A
GERMAN TOY FACTORY.

177
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,333
BUT SHE SPECIALIZES IN ROBOTICS,
AND THE STUFF SHE WORKS ON

178
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,916
PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS
GETS CONVERTED FOR MILITARY USE.

179
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,625
- IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
IF PEOPLE WANT

180
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,041
TO TAKE MY RESEARCH AND USE IT

181
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,625
TO MAKE WEAPONS TO
KILL OTHER PEOPLE.

182
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,083
THAT'S JUST FINE.
I'M A LOT MORE CONCERNED

183
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,875
ABOUT THE BUTTERFLIES'
CONTINUED SURVIVAL.

184
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,916
THEY'RE THE ONES IN DANGER.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
HOW MANY BILLIONS OF HUMANS
ARE THERE IN THE WORLD?

186
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,541
TOO MANY.
WE'RE OVER-POPULATED.

187
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,041
- THE MOUNTAIN
YOU'RE THINKING OF

188
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,083
IS COVERED IN SNOW
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

189
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,583
- DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT, MOKO!

190
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,708
SEE, I HAVE
EVERYTHING WE NEED.

191
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,958
A G.P.S. UNIT AND THIS THESIS
BY PROFESSOR JAMES,

192
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,250
WORLD-RENOWNED
BUTTERFLY EXPERT!

193
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,041
PROFESSOR JAMES
WILL SHOW THE WAY.

194
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,208
- WHO?

195
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,250
- WE'RE GONNA TRACK DOWN
A RARE BUTTERFLY!

196
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:05,458
BE READY IN FIVE.
- THIS IS A BAD IDEA, DOC.

197
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,416
- ( laughs )

198
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,083
EVERY MOMENT WE SPEND HERE
IS ONE STOLEN

199
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,125
FROM THE FIGHT TO
SAVE THE BUTTERFLIES!

200
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,416
- CALM DOWN.

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,208
- FOUR MINUTES NOW, MOKO!
HURRY.

202
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,375
- WE REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS!

203
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,708
- Valmet: 96, 97,

204
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,666
98, 99.

205
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,958
AFRICA, AFRICA,

206
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,708
AFRICA,
AFRICA.

207
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,500
AFRICA, AFRICA,

208
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:37,791
AFRICA, AFRICA, AFRICA.

209
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,958
I LOST COUNT SOMEWHERE.

210
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,916
LET ME THINK.
WHERE WAS I?

211
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,041
GOOD MORNING, JONAH.
WHAT'RE YOU UP TO?

212
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,666
- MORNIN'.
NOT A LOT.

213
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,666
- HERE--
A RUBBER PRACTICE KNIFE.

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,208
YOU WANT TO JOIN ME
FOR SOME EXERCISES?

215
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,000
BIG SWINGS LEAVE YOU OPEN.

216
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,041
TRY FOR SEVERAL STRIKES,

217
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,416
EVEN IF
THEY'RE JUST SHALLOW ONES.

218
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,416
STAY LOW TO THE EARTH.

219
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,708
IF YOU JUMP, YOU'RE FUCKED.

220
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,791
ONCE YOU'RE IN THE AIR,
I GET TO DICTATE THE FIGHT.

221
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,958
ENOUGH FOR TODAY.
LET'S HIT THE SHOWERS.

222
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:31,833
- ( Koko groaning )

223
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:37,500
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- I'M NOT SURE.

224
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,666
IT'S NOT QUITE TIME
FOR OUR APPOINTMENT.

225
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,291
BUT I'VE GOT THIS
SNEAKING SUSPICION

226
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,375
SHE'S NOT GOING TO SHOW.

227
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,000
- FIVE BUCKS SAYS SHE DOESN'T.

228
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:48,250
- ( car approaches )
- Malin: MS. HEKMATYAR, HELLO!

229
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

230
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,916
- HMM. HEY, MALIN.
IT'S BEEN AWHILE, HUH?

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,041
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

232
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,666
I CAME TO GIVE YOU
A MESSAGE FROM DR. MIAMI--

233
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,000
- NO, STOP.

234
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:03,000
THE VERY FACT THAT YOU'RE
HERE IS MESSAGE ENOUGH.

235
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,833
THE GOOD DOCTOR
RAN OFF SOMEWHERE AGAIN.

236
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,041
DIDN'T SHE?

237
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,750
- THAT'S IT EXACTLY.
I AM TRULY VERY SORRY!

238
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,041
- THERE'S NO NEED
FOR YOU TO APOLOGIZE.

239
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
- ( laughs )

240
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:15,708
- ALSO THERE'S
AN UNRELATED MATTER TO DISCUSS.

241
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,500
- A MYSTERIOUS CHINESE MAN?
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

242
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,791
AN OLDER MAN WITH A CANE
AND HIS YOUNG FEMALE ASSISTANT.

243
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,000
THEY PAID FREQUENT VISITS
TO THE DOCTOR.

244
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,666
THE ASSISTANT HAD A COLD,
PIERCING GAZE.

245
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,625
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT,
SHE WAS REALLY RATHER BEAUTIFUL.

246
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,666
THEY'VE BEEN TAKING DR. MIAMI
OUT TO EAT AT PORT ELIZABETH,

247
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,708
AND SHE NEVER
GETS HOME UNTIL LATE.

248
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,291
"THE FRIED RICE WAS AMAZING,"
IS ALL SHE EVER SAYS.

249
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,041
THE DOCTOR CAN BE VERY NAIVE.

250
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:45,125
SHE WON'T ANSWER ME WHEN I ASK
WHAT THE MAN WAS LIKE.

251
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:48,541
BOTH SHE AND MOKOENA REFUSE
TO SAY A WORD ON THE SUBJECT.

252
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,583
I THINK SHE'S DOING HER BEST
NOT TO ALARM THE COMPANY,

253
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,833
BUT HONESTLY,
I'M QUITE WORRIED ABOUT HER.

254
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:55,833
OH, AND IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THIS,

255
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,541
SHE APPARENTLY WENT OFF
BUTTERFLY HUNTING.

256
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,416
SHE E-MAILED ME
THE G.P.S. COORDINATES EARLIER.

257
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,250
- ( laughs )

258
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,958
ALL RIGHT, JONAH,
YOU GET ONE GUESS.

259
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,041
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS GATHERING IS?

260
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,083
- A WEAPONS EXPO.
- EXACTLY.

261
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,625
- IS EVERYTHING THEY'RE
SHOWING HERE NEWLY INVENTED?

262
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,958
- MMM, FOR THE MOST PART, NO.

263
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,000
THERE ARE SOME
LOCAL MUNITIONS MANUFACTURERS,

264
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,000
BUT MAINLY
IT'S WESTERN COMPANIES

265
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,208
BRINGING IN UPGRADE PACKAGES
TO IMPROVE PRE-EXISTING WEAPONS.

266
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,958
THAT'S THE TREND NOW.

267
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,333
BUT IT'S GOING TO
CHANGE BEFORE LONG.

268
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,833
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE INESTIMABLE KOKO HEKMATYAR.

269
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,625
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

270
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:53,250
- I KNOW THAT SMARMY VOICE.
PRESIDENT CURRY OF C.C.A.T.

271
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,916
- AH, IT'S KOKO AND YOUNG JONAH.

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,708
- WITH MILDO AND LOU IN TOW,
OF COURSE.

273
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,875
- DID YOU BUY
KERN AND KRAUSS'S NEW TOY?

274
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,375
- WASN'T THAT GOING
FOR 200 MILLION EUROS?

275
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,375
- WE CAN'T MAKE A MOVE
WITH THE INFESTATION--

276
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,041
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS,
PRESIDENT CURRY.

277
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,250
HOW'S THE EXPO FOR YOU
THIS YEAR?

278
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,875
- A COMPLETE AND UTTER WASTE
OF MY TIME.

279
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,375
I'M GOING TO PULL OUT
OF EAST AND SOUTH AFRICA

280
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,083
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
- OH?

281
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,083
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
MISS HEKMATYAR,

282
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,625
I MUST BE GOING.

283
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,000
- GOOD AFTERNOON,
MS. HEKMATYAR.

284
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:29,708
YOU ARE KOKO HEKMATYAR?

285
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,875
I AM GUO MING CHEN OF THE
DA SHINGHAI TRADING COMPANY

286
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
OF HONG KONG.

287
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,166
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

288
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,208
- OH NO, MR. CHEN,
THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

289
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,541
- I HATE TO IMPOSE UPON YOU,

290
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,208
BUT COULD YOU MAKE ROOM
IN YOUR SCHEDULE

291
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,916
TO MEET WITH ME TONIGHT?

292
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,416
AS YOU CAN SEE,

293
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,000
I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY STANDING
FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.

294
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,750
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

295
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,125
PERHAPS I CAN TAKE YOU
OUT TO DINNER SOMEWHERE?

296
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:56,833
- MAKE IT HIGH-END CHINESE,
AND YOU'VE GOT A DEAL!

297
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,708
- ( laughs )

298
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,666
YOU'RE A FASCINATING
YOUNG LADY.

299
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,291
I MUST RETIRE NOW.
I LOOK FORWARD TO DINNER.

300
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,666
- LEHM?
- YOU RANG?

301
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,916
- A CHINESE GENTLEMAN INVITED ME
OUT TO DINNER THIS EVENING.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,833
- NICE.
SO I ASSUME YOU'RE GOING?

303
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:20,125
- CHECK THIS OUT, AND GO ARMED.
- RIGHT.  I'M ON IT.

304
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,583
- PASS ALONG TO KAREN THAT THE
WOMAN'S UNIT IS ON THE MOVE.

305
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,666
- YES, SIR.

306
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,583
- Lutz:
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

307
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,833
EIGHT PEOPLE IN ONE CAR?
IT'S TOO MUCH.

308
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:36,333
- YOU'LL WANT TO WRAP THAT GUN
UP IN WHITE TAPE FOR CAMOUFLAGE.

309
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,416
DID EVERYONE
GET A LOOK AT THE PHOTO?

310
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,125
OUR MISSION IS TO SECURE
THIS WOMAN, DR. MIAMI.

311
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:45,208
AND IF ANYBODY OUT HERE
TRIES TO GET IN OUR WAY, WELL--

312
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,541
--WE ELIMINATE 'EM, BOYS.

313
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,833
- I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE'RE GOING TO SEE

314
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,666
ANY BUTTERFLIES THIS TRIP.

315
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,458
DOCTOR?
- PATIENCE, MOKO.

316
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,666
WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING.
THEY'RE DOWN THERE.

317
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,083
IT'S A VERITABLE
BUTTERFLY PARADISE.

318
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,833
AND YOU-- YOU WOULD TAKE A GUN
AMONGST THEM?

319
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,833
- I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU.

320
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,041
WHO KNOWS
WHAT WE MIGHT FIND UP HERE?

321
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,625
- RIDICULOUS.

322
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:20,875
- COME ON.

323
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,541
I'D LIKE TO FIND THIS DOCTOR
BEFORE MY BALLS FREEZE OFF.

324
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,291
- LIEUTENANT?

325
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,416
- ESTIMATED DISTANCE?
- ABOUT 200 METERS.

326
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,041
THEY'RE CARRYING
SUBMACHINE GUNS,

327
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,125
ASSAULT RIFLES
AND SNIPER RIFLES.

328
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,625
DR. MINAMI HAS NOT YET
REACHED POINT PARADISE.

329
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,541
SHE'S MOVING AT A NORMAL PACE.

330
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:47,750
- KEEP THIS DISTANCE,
BUT AHEAD OF THEM.  MOVE.

331
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:52,458
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE DAMN DOCTOR.

332
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,625
IT'S HEKMATYAR'S PEOPLE
I WANT.

333
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,000
I'LL SLAUGHTER THEM ALL
AND AVENGE THE MEN

334
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,166
WHOSE LIVES KASPER STOLE.

335
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:13,125
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, JONAH?
ANY HOSTILES OUT THERE?

336
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,291
- YEAH, EIGHT OF 'EM.

337
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,958
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T
BE ASKING ME THAT.

338
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:19,291
IT'S BETTER PRACTICE IF WE EACH
FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN.

339
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,250
- ( laughs )
HE GOT YOU THERE.

340
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,833
YOU KNOW, LUTZ,
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO TRAIN

341
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,125
IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH JONAH
FOR A MONTH OR SO.

342
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,250
- YOU STAY OUT OF IT.

343
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,083
- KEEP YOUR VOICES
DOWN, CHILDREN.

344
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,333
THIS ISN'T A FIELD TRIP.

345
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,208
- Jonah: TOJO.

346
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,791
CAN YOU REMIND ME THE NAME
OF THAT DOCTOR LADY AGAIN?

347
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:55,500
- OH, UH, MIAMI,
LIKE THAT CITY IN AMERICA.

348
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,833
- HUH?
- MIAMI!

349
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,291
- SCATTER.
- DOCTOR!

350
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:05,500
DOCTOR!
DOCTOR MIAMI!

351
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,916
- IT'S JUST A BLUFF.
STAY DOWN.

352
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,416
- DOCTOR.
HEY, DOCTOR.

353
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,708
- DAMN IT!
THEY FIGURED OUT WHERE WE ARE.

354
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,458
- NO!  HE'S JUST SHOOTING BLIND,
HOPING TO HIT US.

355
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,958
- JONAH, CAN YOU SEE THE ENEMY?
WHERE ARE THEY?

356
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,250
- NO IDEA. I'M JUST SHOOTING
TILL I FIND 'EM.

357
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,666
- DAMN.

358
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,916
- IDIOT.

359
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,333
- WELL, LOOK AT THAT.
THE ARMY ANTS ARE COMING OUT.

360
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,833
I CAN'T SAY THAT'S THE METHOD
I WOULD HAVE GONE WITH.

361
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:42,125
BUT I'VE GOTTA
GIVE THE KID CREDIT

362
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,500
FOR SCREWING UP WHATEVER AMBUSH
THEY PLANNED.

363
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,250
- Karen:
OUR PLAN IS RUINED NOW.

364
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:57,333
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

365
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:15,708
YOU SCREWED UP
DURING THE KASPER INCIDENT TOO.

366
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,291
APOLOGIZE FROM HELL.

367
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,333
- VALMET?

368
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,166
- ( theme music playing )

369
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,083
