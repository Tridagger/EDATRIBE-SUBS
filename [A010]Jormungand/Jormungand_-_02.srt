1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,333
- DAMN IT!
I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO THEM.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:12,500
IS THE SIGNAL BEING JAMMED?

3
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:15,083
DON'T SAY "MAYBE."
MAYBE DOESN'T CUT IT.

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:17,875
IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM NOW.
- LOOK OUT, WORLD.

5
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,250
THE LITTLE LADY
IS PISSED OFF AGAIN.

6
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,250
- THOSE IDIOTS
AT HQ ARE USELESS.

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,208
I'M SO SICK OF THIS SHIT.

8
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,625
HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEET UP
WITH VALMET AND TOJO

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,541
IF I CAN'T REACH THEM?

10
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,000
AND SOMETHING ELSE
I WANT TO KNOW.

11
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,000
WHO ARE THOSE GUYS?

12
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:36,541
- ( theme music playing )

13
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,666
- Lehm: THAT'S ONE OF
THE BORDER POLICE'S RIDES.

14
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,291
HOW DO WE PLAY IT?
- Koko: DON'T BOTHER STOPPING.

15
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:15,041
IF THEY WANNA PIT AN LAV AGAINST
A 20-TON TRUCK--

16
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,708
- ( screaming )
- ( tires screeching )

17
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,708
AMBUSH.  DAMN!

18
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,541
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET BACK HERE.

19
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,500
- ( sighs )

20
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:33,125
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!

21
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:37,250
- ( laughs ) THEY'RE FIGHTING
FOR THAT PIPELINE.

22
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,041
- WE LANDED OURSELVES SMACK
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLEFIELD.

23
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,666
BUT HEY, AT LEAST
THAT EXPLAINS

24
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,958
WHY THE PHONE
WASN'T WORKING RIGHT.

25
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:49,375
CHECK IT OUT, WE GOT GMS MOBILE
PHONE BASE STATIONS,

26
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:53,291
RELAY TOWERS AND MICROWAVE
TRANSMISSION SITES,

27
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,458
ALL BLOWN UP BY WHOEVER
GOT THERE FIRST.

28
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,083
CRAP LIKE THIS GOES DOWN,

29
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,666
BOTH SIDES WANT
TO CONTROL INFORMATION,

30
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,458
WHICH IS WHAT I MEANT
ABOUT THE SAT-PHONE.

31
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,291
COVERT WAR EQUALS
TOTAL BLACKOUT.

32
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,541
- HMM.  YOU KNOW AN AWFUL LOT
ABOUT THIS, LEHM.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,125
- I GUESS.

34
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:13,083
- Man: WE GOT EYES
ON TWO HEAVY LOAD TRUCKS

35
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,208
AND A SQUAD EQUIPPED
WITH SMALL ARMS.

36
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,875
BODYGUARDS, MOST LIKELY.

37
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,750
AND A WOMAN HAVING
SOME KIND OF SEIZURE.

38
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:23,750
- Man #2: THAT'S OUR DEALER.
HOLD FIRE.

39
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,666
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
WE'RE NOT THE ENEMY.

40
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,583
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
US FRIENDS, THOUGH.

41
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,541
- Man: I'M GLAD YOU COULD
MAKE IT, MS. HEKMATYAR.

42
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,291
IT'S A PLEASURE.

43
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,208
 I MUST SAY, YOU'RE A LOT
YOUNGER THAN I EXPECTED. 

44
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,750
- NICE TO MEET YOU,
MAJOR POLLACK.

45
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,250
- SORRY IF MY MEN WERE
A LITTLE ROUGH.

46
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,041
THEY'RE KIND OF ON EDGE.

47
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:45,958
I'M GLAD TO SEE ALL EIGHT
ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES MADE IT,

48
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,458
AS WE AGREED.
- OF COURSE, MAJOR.

49
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,708
- NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SIGN--
- NO NEED TO RUSH, IS THERE?

50
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,625
GO ON, PULL UP A CHAIR.

51
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,750
- SO TELL ME,
WHEN DID THE SHIT HIT THE FAN?

52
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,541
- JUST EIGHT HOURS AGO.

53
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:01,500
- I THOUGHT LIEUTENANT COLONEL
GRANT WAS TAKING THIS DELIVERY.

54
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,625
- WELL, THINGS CHANGE.

55
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,541
NOT EVERYONE HAS THE STOMACH
FOR THIS KIND OF FIGHTING.

56
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:10,000
SO LET'S JUST FORGET ALL
ABOUT THE LIEUTENANT COLONEL.

57
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:13,416
- DAMN.
THIS IS GONNA GET UGLY SOON.

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,416
VERY UGLY.  THINGS ARE VOLATILE
ENOUGH HERE ALREADY,

59
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,291
AND NOW THIS GUY WANTS
EVEN MORE WEAPONS.

60
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,666
HE'LL NEVER BE SATISFIED.

61
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,666
- WAIT FOR IT.

62
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,041
- HERE YOU GO.
THE ORDER'S COMPLETE.

63
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,416
BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
ELSE YOU CAN DO FOR ME.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,041
- THERE IT IS.
- Woman: KOKO?

65
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,250
( laughing )
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

66
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,125
- HEY, GIRL, LONG TIME NO SEE.
- MILDO.

67
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,958
AND LOU'S WITH YOU.

68
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:44,041
- HEY, WHERE'S VALMET HIDING?
- SHE'S NOT WITH US ON THIS RUN.

69
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:47,333
BUT WITH THE TWO OF YOU HERE,
THAT'S GOTTA MEAN...

70
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,666
- WELL, KOKO HEKMATYAR.

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,250
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

72
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,500
- PRESIDENT CURRY
OF ENGLAND'S CCAT.

73
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,791
"COINCIDENCE" MY ASS.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,958
- HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?
- WHO'S THIS CHARMING LAD?

75
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,625
A NEW RECRUIT?
( laughs ) AW, THAT'S CLASSIC.

76
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,250
- WHAT'S MR. CURRY HAVE
FOR YOU?

77
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,708
- STINGER MISSILES.

78
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:19,208
- NEW WARHEADS
WITH REFURBISHED LAUNCHERS.

79
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,916
WE ACQUIRED 'EM FROM SUPPLIERS
IN EASTERN EUROPE.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,416
ONCE THEY'RE OPERATIONAL,

81
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
WE'LL GET TO WATCH
AS ATTACK HELIS DROP

82
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,500
LIKE MOSQUITOES,
JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

83
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,250
- RIGHT.  HE'S GETTING
OUT OF HERE AS SOON AS HE CAN.

84
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,250
- THEY'RE POWERFUL,
PLENTIFUL AND INEXPENSIVE.

85
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,291
PRECISELY THE KIND OF GOODS
OUR CUSTOMERS LOOK FOR.

86
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,833
- WELL, THIS HAS BEEN RIVETING,

87
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:40,000
BUT NOW THAT OUR CONTRACT
HAS BEEN FULFILLED,

88
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,500
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY--
- WE'RE NOT DONE.

89
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:44,125
I NEED SOMETHING ELSE.
- WHAT'S THAT?

90
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,083
- A NEW RADAR UNIT.

91
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,791
MY RADAR SITE WAS TAKEN OUT
IN AN AIR RAID.

92
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,958
I NEED A BATTLEFIELD RADAR
TO REPLACE IT.

93
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:56,041
SOMETHING OF THAT SIZE
IS BEYOND MY CAPABILITIES.

94
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,375
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF
THING I CARRY WITH ME--

95
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,166
- BUT SURELY YOU CAN GET ONE.

96
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,250
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE.
YOUR OWN FATHER,

97
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,958
MR. FLOYD HEKMATYAR,
IS A NAVY GIANT.

98
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,333
IT'S NO SECRET THAT A SIZABLE
CHUNK OF HCLI'S

99
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,166
NAVAL WEAPONS SALES
IN EUROPE AND AFRICA

100
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,583
ARE PERSONALLY OVERSEEN BY YOU.

101
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,416
YOU DON'T
EXPECT US TO BELIEVE

102
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,375
YOU CAN'T GET HOLD
OF A SIMPLE RADAR UNIT.

103
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,041
- YOU OLD FART.

104
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,875
DON'T THINK I CAN'T SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

105
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,458
NOPE, NOT HAPPENING.

106
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:27,250
TOO BAD.  SO SAD.
- WHAT THE BLOODY HELL?

107
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,291
- CAN'T HELP.  GOTTA GO.

108
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,666
- YOU'RE NOT LEAVING YET.
RIGHT, MEN?

109
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,750
- YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER.  TELL
YOUR GUYS TO BACK THE HELL OFF.

110
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,083
- LUTZ, ENOUGH!

111
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,791
( laughs )
LET'S ALL SETTLE DOWN.

112
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,375
NO REASON THIS HAS
TO GO ALL TARANTINO.

113
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,625
I'VE UNDERESTIMATED YOU,
MAJOR POLLACK.

114
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,833
YOU'RE FEISTIER THAN YOU LOOK.

115
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,833
YOU'VE ORCHESTRATED
AN INFORMATION BLACKOUT.

116
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,000
I'LL BET YOUR INFANTRY EVEN
HAS ORDERS TO KILL ANY CIVILIAN

117
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,333
OR JOURNALIST WHO TRIES
TO FLEE OVER THE PASS.

118
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,125
YOU'RE DESPERATE TO KEEP

119
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,250
THIS BATTLE FOR
THE PIPELINE A SECRET.

120
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,666
YOU INTEND TO KEEP IT
FOR YOURSELF.

121
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,916
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO INSIDIOUS
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,583
( laughs ) YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT
ONE THING, THOUGH.

123
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:12,583
A SOLDIER DOES EARN HIS PAYCHECK
BY KILLING PEOPLE.

124
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,250
AND AS IT HAPPENS,
MY SOLDIERS ARE VERY WELL PAID.

125
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,083
THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO.

126
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,458
IT'S MY TASK TO GET
THEM THE MATERIALS 

127
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,208
THEY NEED TO DO THAT JOB.

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,000
YOU CAN AND WILL GET
ME WHAT I NEED.

129
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,041
THAT IS NOT A REQUEST.

130
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,750
NOW YOU GO SEE ABOUT
GETTING MY RADAR UNIT.

131
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:32,291
I'VE GOT SOME THINGS
TO TAKE CARE OF.

132
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:35,500
OF COURSE, YOU'LL BE WELL
COMPENSATED WHEN THIS IS OVER.

133
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,666
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE, LAD,
BUT I GUESS THE STORM'S PASSED.

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,916
YEAH?
- GOODNESS.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,375
PRICKLY FELLOW AND DANGEROUS,
TOO, I'D WAGER.

136
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:49,333
- HE'S NOTHING.  WHY DON'T YOU
RUN ALONG HOME NOW?

137
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:51,375
- TA.

138
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:55,666
- SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

139
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,708
- WE'VE GOT AN ORDER TO FILL.

140
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,166
- All: AHH.

141
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,416
- WE NEED TO LOCATE
VALMET AND TOJO.

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,625
ACCORDING TO MY INTEL, THIS ARMY
IS JUST ABOUT OUT OF FUNDS.

143
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,541
HE'D NEVER COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT,

144
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:15,000
BUT IT'S CLEAR HE ONLY INTENDS
TO PAY UP IF HIS SIDE WINS.

145
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,416
I AM NOT A BANK.
I'M KOKO HEKMATYAR.

146
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,291
I NEVER HAVE NOR WILL
ACCEPT CREDIT!

147
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,250
- All: AHH.

148
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:26,333
- ( gunfire )
- Valmet: I DON'T LIKE THIS.

149
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,125
KOKO'S INSTRUCTIONS
WERE TO WAIT FOR HER

150
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,708
AND THE OTHERS
AT THAT PASS.

151
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,541
- WHAT WERE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

152
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,708
IT'S NOT OUR FAULT THOSE GUYS
DECIDED TO RAID THE AREA.

153
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,875
MAN, THE SUN'S SETTING
AND THEY'RE STILL GOING AT IT.

154
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,041
THAT'S DEDICATION.
- "DEDICATION"?

155
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,166
MORE LIKE STUPIDITY.
RANK AMATEURS.

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,166
- OOH!
SOMEBODY'S IN A MOOD, HUH?

157
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,500
- IF YOU WANT,
WE CAN DO A QUICK CHECK

158
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,166
ON THE PASS IN THE MORNING.

159
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,166
THAT ALL RIGHT?
- FINE BY ME.

160
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,000
- AND, HEY, AT LEAST WE FOUND
A PLACE TO CHARGE OUR CELLS.

161
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,958
YEAH, THIS SPOT ISN'T SO BAD.

162
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,916
KIND OF NICE
SLEEPING UNDER THE STARS.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,750
- Pollack: YOU WANT TO CONTACT
HCLI HEADQUARTERS.

164
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,666
YOUR CELLS WILL HAVE RECEPTION
AGAIN ONCE YOU CROSS THE PASS,

165
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,708
EVEN THAT PRECIOUS
IRIDIUM PHONE OF YOURS

166
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,291
ISN'T WORKING HERE, IS IT?

167
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,583
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES

168
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,625
IN ALL OF EUROPE 
OUT OF ITS RANGE.

169
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,125
- I'M IMPRESSED YOU KNEW I HAD
A SAT-PHONE ON ME,

170
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,041
BUT YEAH, STILL OUT OF RANGE.

171
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,000
- I'LL HAVE TWO OF MY ELITE
SOLDIERS ACCOMPANY YOU.

172
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,875
AS LONG AS YOU'VE
GOT THEM ALONG,

173
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,958
YOU SHOULD MAKE IT THROUGH
THE PASS SAFE ENOUGH.

174
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:30,000
- GUARD DOGS.

175
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,458
- TAKE CARE.
IT CAN BE TREACHEROUS.

176
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:36,166
OH, AND IF YOU TRY TO PULL
ANYTHING STUPID I WILL KILL YOU.

177
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,250
- YOU THINK YOU'RE
A REAL BADASS, DON'T YOU?

178
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,041
- REALLY?  TEN MINUTES AND
YOU'RE ALREADY TALKING SMACK?

179
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,875
- PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE ME SICK.

180
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,041
HOW MANY DEATHS ARE YOU
RESPONSIBLE FOR?

181
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,416
GUESS WHATEVER
FANCY COLLEGE YOU WENT TO

182
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,041
DIDN'T OFFER
A CLASS ON ETHICS.

183
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,000
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

184
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,375
I'M JUST A MERCHANT.

185
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:01,458
I NEVER WENT TO ANYTHING
RESEMBLING SCHOOL,

186
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,208
LET ALONE A "FANCY COLLEGE."

187
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,375
DESPITE MY LACK OF
FORMAL EDUCATION, HOWEVER,

188
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,583
I KNOW MORE ABOUT WEAPONS
THAN A SHITHEAD LIKE YOU 

189
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:11,708
CAN EVER HOPE TO IN A LIFETIME,
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE,

190
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,500
BECAUSE
I FIND IT VERY DEPRESSING

191
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,083
TO HAND MY QUALITY MERCHANDISE
OVER TO SOLDIERS NOT WORTHY

192
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,708
OF WIELDING BB GUNS.
AND NOW YOU'VE PISSED ME OFF.

193
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,958
SO YOU MIGHT WANT
TO STOP TALKING.

194
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,833
- WHAT DID YOU SAY,
YOU LITTLE--

195
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:31,208
- Man:
THIS IS ORIN PASS.

196
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,208
- UGH.  SO FOGGY.

197
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,333
WE MIGHT FINALLY BE ABLE TO GET
THROUGH TO SOMEONE, THOUGH.

198
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,291
YOU DO IT.
TRY CALLING VALMET AND TOJO.

199
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,666
- ( ringing )
- IT'S RINGING.

200
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,000
- WE'VE GOT RECEPTION.
AWESOME!

201
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,875
THOSE ARE MI-24V
HIND Es UP THERE.

202
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,666
THEY'RE RUSSIAN ARMY COPTERS.

203
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,125
WHOA!

204
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,916
EVERYONE, TAKE COVER.
GET AWAY FROM THE CAR.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,875
WHAT'S THEIR TARGET?

206
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,791
IS THE MOUNTAIN INFANTRY NEARBY?

207
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,500
A STINGER.

208
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,375
LOOKS LIKE IT MISSED.  HMM.

209
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:19,750
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- MAJOR POLLACK'S ARMS DEALER.

210
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,583
ARE YOU A PART OF THE UNIT
FIRING THE STINGERS?

211
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,666
- I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT.
- THEY'RE AS GOOD AS DEAD.

212
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,458
GET YOUR MEN AWAY
FROM THE HINDS.

213
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,916
THOSE THINGS ARE DESIGNED
TO HUNT PEOPLE.

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,416
LOOK AT THE SENSOR POD.

215
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,125
THE NORMAL LOW-LIGHT LEVEL
TV "RADUGA-F" HAS BEEN MODIFIED

216
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,958
BY AN EASTERN EUROPEAN THIRD
PARTY WITH A THERMAL SENSOR.

217
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,875
IF HE WANTED TO,
THE PILOT COULD EASILY

218
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,166
PICK UP ON OUR HEAT SIGNATU--

219
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,250
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

220
00:11:57,333 --> 00:12:00,708
- THIS CHICK HASN'T STOPPED
SMILING THE ENTIRE TIME.

221
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,958
SHE'S NUTS.

222
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,583
YOU WERE LUCKY THIS TIME.
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

223
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,041
- I WAS PLANNING TO.

224
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,916
- WHY NOT JUST GO AHEAD
AND SELL HIM WHAT HE WANTS?

225
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,875
- MY GUT.
THIS BATTLE WILL BE SHORT.

226
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,833
TWO DAYS AT THE ABSOLUTE MOST.

227
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,666
IN THE END,
NO ONE WILL REALLY WIN.

228
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,833
RUSSIA'S ALREADY FULL
OF THESE SKIRMISHES,

229
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:29,458
AND THIS MAJOR HAS A LOT MORE
AMBITION THAN HE CAN AFFORD.

230
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,875
THERE'LL BE PLENTY OF FIGHTS

231
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,666
JUST LIKE THIS ONE
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS,

232
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,833
NONE OF THEM WILL BE DECISIVE.

233
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,541
AND NO FACTION
WILL GAIN CONTROL

234
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,208
OF THAT PIPELINE
AND ITS LIQUID GOLD.

235
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,875
PLENTY OF DEALERS WOULD SEE
THIS MESS AND START SALIVATING,

236
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,916
READY TO SELL WEAPONS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,166
MOST OF THEM, IN FACT,

238
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,291
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I OPERATE.

239
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:52,666
AND SO, WE HAVE NO FURTHER
BUSINESS ON THIS BATTLEFIELD.

240
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,791
- WE'RE BASING THIS ALL
ON YOUR GUT?

241
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,291
- YES, BEING A PART
OF THIS TEAM

242
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:00,958
MEANS TRUSTING MY INTUITION.

243
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,083
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

244
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,833
- ( screaming )
- SON OF A BITCH!

245
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:25,500
- FUCK, MILDO.  WHAT THE BLOODY
HELL WERE YOU THINKING?

246
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,708
- EH, THEY WERE PISSING ME OFF.

247
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,458
ELITE SOLDIERS, MY ASS.

248
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,625
ALL THAT WHINING WAS
GETTING ON ME LAST NERVE.

249
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,458
- DID IT EVEN OCCUR TO YOU,
IN YOUR INFINITE STUPIDITY,

250
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,291
THAT THE MAJOR
SENT THEM ALONG AS ID

251
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,958
TO GET US THROUGH THE PASS?
MY ENTIRE PLAN IS IN SHAMBLES

252
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,541
BECAUSE YOU WERE
GETTING ANNOYED?

253
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:44,416
DAMN TRIGGER-HAPPY BITCH.
LET ME SEE THE MAP.

254
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,708
- NOTHING FAZES HIM FOR LONG.
I LIKE THAT IN A BOSS.

255
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,541
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING TO?

256
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,958
- I'M CONFIRMING WITH HQ
WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED

257
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,458
TO PICK UP THE GOODS.

258
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:01,750
- WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THEM?

259
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,083
- Koko:
NOTHING LETHAL FOR NOW.

260
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:12,083
TIE THEM UP GOOD.
OH, AND GAG THAT ONE.

261
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,208
HE PISSES ME OFF.  A LOT.

262
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,291
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I WAS FREAKING WORRIED.

263
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,083
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU,
TOO, KOKO.

264
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:26,250
I COULD DIE HAPPY RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY.

265
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,208
WE GOT EVERYONE?
LET'S GET MOVING.

266
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,125
- WHOOPS.  NOSEBLEED.

267
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,708
- WELL, LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE.

268
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:45,041
PUT IT DOWN, LOU.

269
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,291
HEY, IT'S JUST OUR
FRIENDS FROM CCAT.

270
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,250
IT'S ALL GOOD.
WE'RE CLEAR FOR ENTRY.

271
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,000
- NO, ACTUALLY,
IT'S NOT ALL GOOD.

272
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:59,458
- WELL, MR. CURRY.
FANCY RUNNING INTO YOU HERE.

273
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,375
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
THOUGHT YOU'D BE WELL

274
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:05,375
ON YOUR WAY BACK
TO JOLLY OL' ENGLAND BY NOW.

275
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,375
- BEEN A WHILE, YEAH?
- I GUESS.

276
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,541
- DAMN.  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW FASCINATING I FIND YOU?

277
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:15,041
I MEAN, A ONE-EYED
WOMAN SOLDIER.

278
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:17,958
JUST THE THOUGHT OF YOU FIGHTING
WITH THAT KNIFE MAKES ME SHIVER.

279
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,416
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
YOU WANNA HAVE A GO?

280
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,458
- I THINK I'M GONNA PASS.
SO SORRY.

281
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,583
- MR. CURRY.
- SHUT UP.

282
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,708
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.
JUST SIT STILL.

283
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,500
- I DON'T KNOW HOW.

284
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,458
- UGH!

285
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,166
DID YOU KILL THE GUARD DOGS
THE MAJOR SENT WITH YOU?

286
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,875
- NO, TYING THEM UP WAS
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH.

287
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,750
- WELL, THAT STUPID WOMAN
KILLED OURS.

288
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,208
ONCE HE KNOWS, HE'S LIKELY
TO SEND GUYS AFTER US.

289
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,000
- MORE THAN LIKELY.

290
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,875
- WHY DON'T WE SEND OUT
A COUPLE OF SCOUTS TO BE SAFE?

291
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,125
- I'M SO SORRY, VALMET.
DO YOU MIND?

292
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:57,208
- NO PROB.

293
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,375
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
GET YOUR WISH.

294
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,708
I CAN'T SAY NO TO KOKO.

295
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,166
- SHE'S CHANGED, HASN'T SHE?

296
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,958
I MEAN, THE LAST TIME I SAW HER,
SHE WAS AMAZING,

297
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,125
AND NOW SHE'S
EVEN MORE AMAZING.

298
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,666
- KOKO WAS THE BEST THEN
AND SHE STILL IS.

299
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,625
- LET'S PLAY!

300
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,208
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU
HAVEN'T LOST YOUR EDGE.

301
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:37,000
NOT THAT I EVER
THOUGHT YOU WOULD.

302
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,708
I CAN'T TOUCH YOU.

303
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,875
YOU'D EXPECT THAT BUM EYE
TO BE A DISADVANTAGE

304
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,791
IN A KNIFE FIGHT,
BUT IT'S NOT.

305
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:44,916
I THOUGHT THE DARK MIGHT
EVEN THE PLAYING FIELD

306
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,375
A BIT THIS TIME.

307
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,333
SEE, I'VE GOT GREAT
NIGHT VISION, 

308
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,041
BUT I'M STILL LOSING.
DAMN YOU!

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,875
- HARD TO BELIEVE,
BUT YOUR MOVEMENTS SEEM EVEN

310
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,041
STIFFER THAN LAST TIME,
MILDO.

311
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,041
I LOVE A GOOD KNIFE
MORE THAN ANYONE,

312
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,375
SO I GET WHY YOU WANNA
CARRY SO MANY,

313
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,500
BUT WEIGHING YOURSELF DOWN
WITH THEM MAKES YOU CLUMSY.

314
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,583
EVEN JONAH OUR NEW RECRUIT

315
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,083
SAID YOU WERE COVERED
WITH THE DAMN THINGS.

316
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,875
- JONAH.
SO THAT'S THE KID'S NAME.

317
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:20,458
- AND YOU THREW THIS KNIFE
THINKING YOU'D MANEUVER

318
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,583
THE FIGHT BACK OVER HERE
AND RECLAIM IT.

319
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,250
YOU'D MAKE A GRAB FOR IT ONCE MY
BACK WAS TURNED OR SOMETHING.

320
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,166
WAS THAT THE PLAN?

321
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,041
SO HOW DID THAT WORK OUT
FOR YOU?

322
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,916
- ( winces )
- WHAT ARE YOU WHINING ABOUT?

323
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,500
ONCE A WEAPON HAS LEFT YOUR
HAND, IT'S GONE FOR GOOD.

324
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:37,291
ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD RELY
ON GETTING IT BACK.

325
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,875
- FUCK ME.
SHE'S IN LECTURE MODE.

326
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,416
THE GROUP OF TEN IS KOKO
HEKMATYAR AND HER HIRED GUNS.

327
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,791
THE GROUP OF THREE IS
CURRY AND HIS LACKEYS.

328
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,583
KOKO'S GROUP SHOULD
BE YOUR PRIORITY.

329
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:51,625
I WANT THEM TAKEN CARE OF.
BE QUICK ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

330
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,416
DON'T FORGET THAT WHILE
YOU'RE DEALING WITH THEM,

331
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,875
ORIN PASS AND THE FREEWAY WILL
BE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK.

332
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,583
- ROGER THAT, MAJOR.
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

333
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,833
IT WAS THE OTHER GROUP
THAT KILLED OUR MEN.

334
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,083
- I'M AWARE OF THAT, THANK YOU.

335
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:09,291
- YOU MAY WANT TO ADJUST
YOUR LINE OF THINKING, MILDO.

336
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,416
YOU WERE CARRYING ON EARLIER
ABOUT YOUR FASCINATION WITH ME,

337
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,375
BUT I WARN YOU, I AM NOT
SOMEONE YOU WANNA GET CLOSE TO.

338
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,000
- OH, COME ON.
YOUR STORY'S AS COOL AS IT GETS.

339
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,250
AN ELITE U.N. SOLDIER
BETRAYED BY HER OWN

340
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,625
AND STRIPPED OF EVERYTHING,
BUT YOU GOT BACK ON YOUR FEET

341
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,833
AND TRAINED YOUR ASS OFF

342
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,208
UNTIL YOU WERE EVEN
BETTER THAN BEFORE.

343
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,875
- I DON'T REALLY GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT YOU,

344
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,916
BUT I WILL OFFER
THIS PIECE OF ADVICE.

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,125
GREAT EXPECTATIONS ONLY LEAD
TO GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT.

346
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,541
- EXPECTATIONS?

347
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,000
I GAVE UP ON THOSE
A WHILE AGO.

348
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,958
PEOPLE WHO DO WHAT WE DO
LEARN EARLY NOT TO EXPECT MUCH

349
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,166
FROM THIS UGLY EMPTY WORLD
BECAUSE WE'RE EMPTY, TOO.

350
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,583
MAYBE IT STARTS THE FIRST TIME
WE HOLD A WEAPON

351
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,916
OR THE FIRST TIME
WE KILL SOMEONE.

352
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,666
WE TELL OURSELVES IT'S TO
PROTECT OUR FAMILY, OUR COUNTRY,

353
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,666
BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG
TO REALIZE THAT'S BULLSHIT.

354
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,333
SO NO, I DON'T EXPECT MUCH.

355
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:03,625
I THINK THAT BEATING YOU WOULD
MAKE LIFE A LITTLE LESS EMPTY.

356
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,375
- IDIOT.
- ALL RIGHT.

357
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:10,500
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK FOR NOW,
BUT NEXT TIME, YOUR ASS IS MINE.

358
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,166
- I TAKE IT YOU'VE DETECTED
SCOUTS NEARBY.  HOW FAR?

359
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,416
- FIVE HUNDRED METERS.  TA!

360
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,041
- GOOD CATCH.

361
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,958
WELL, AT LEAST THE POOR GIRL
IS GOOD FOR SOMETHING.

362
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,583
- GUNS AT THE READY, KIDS.

363
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,208
WE'LL GO FIRST AND ESTABLISH
AN ESCAPE ROUTE.

364
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:31,416
DEPENDING ON WHAT WE'RE
UP AGAINST,

365
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,333
WE MAY BE ABLE TO SUBDUE THEM.

366
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:36,291
I GUESS I'LL LET YOU OWE
ME ONE THIS TIME.

367
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,166
- YOU ARE BRAVE AND GENEROUS
AS EVER, MISS HEKMATYAR.

368
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,041
- NATURALLY.  LATER, MILDO.

369
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,208
- THERE AREN'T VERY MANY,
BUT THEY HAVE US SURROUNDED.

370
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,791
- ON MY COMMAND, SQUAD.

371
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,416
LOWER YOUR WEAPONS!

372
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,041
- ( laughing )
- WHAT THE--?

373
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,958
- NOW REMOVE YOUR CLIPS
AND FOLD YOUR STOCKS.

374
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,166
POLLACK'S MEN, LISTEN UP.
YOU DON'T WANT US.

375
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,125
THE ONES WHO KILLED
YOUR PALS ARE IN THERE.

376
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
- CONNIVING LITTLE TWAT.

377
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,500
DAMN IT.  DAMN IT!

378
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,916
UGH!

379
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:22,875
- LOOKS LIKE WE'LL BE AWAY FROM
OUR POST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

380
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,083
PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TOO HARD
FOR SOMEONE TO SLIP THROUGH

381
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,958
THE BORDER AND HEAD NORTH,

382
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,625
BUT THIS KIND OF STUNT ONLY
WORKS ONCE, LUCKY GIRL.

383
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,083
- HMM.
- ( laughs )

384
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:35,083
- Koko:
STEP LIVELY, EVERYONE.

385
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,583
I WANT THE HELL OUT
OF THIS KILLING FIELD.

386
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,166
- ( laughing )

387
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,750
- AMUSED, JONAH?  WHAT?
- NOTHING.

388
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,625
JUST FEELS KIND OF WEIRD,
IS ALL.

389
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,750
NEVER LEFT A BATTLEFIELD
WITHOUT FIRING MY WEAPON BEFORE.

390
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,625
- SORRY.
WILL YOU FEEL BETTER

391
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,916
IF I LET YOU SHOOT
A WHOLE BUNCH NEXT TIME?

392
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,375
- ( laughing )
- BETTER BE CAREFUL, JONAH.

393
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,833
YOU'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT REAL
QUICK SHE'S ONLY HALF-JOKING

394
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,791
WHEN SHE SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT.
SHE CAN'T HELP IT.

395
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,833
SHE'S AN ARMS DEALER.

396
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,916
- Pollack: BOTH SIDES WERE
ABLE TO ESCAPE?

397
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,791
IMPRESSIVE, BUT UNFORTUNATE.
BLAME YOU?  NO, NOT AT ALL.

398
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,625
I UNDERSTAND YOUR ACTIONS,
AND I'LL STAND BY THEM.

399
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,833
I'M HERE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
THAT'S MY JOB.

400
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:30,541
IT'S OVER AND DONE NOW.
RETURN TO YOUR POST.

401
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,250
IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THE AIR
RAIDS STOPPED

402
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,083
THE SECOND THIS ARRIVED.
IT MAY AS WELL BE A PILE

403
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,791
OF SCRAP METAL FOR ALL THE GOOD
IT'S GONNA DO ME NOW.

404
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,666
JUST MY LUCK.
WORKED OUT FOR HER, THOUGH

405
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,625
THAT WOMAN IS A GRADE-A PSYCHO.

406
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,250
- I KNEW TWO DAYS WAS GENEROUS.
- MA'AM.

407
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,416
- OH, SORRY.  NOTHING.

408
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,583
- HAVE A NICE TRIP.
- THANKS, I WILL.

409
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,666
- ( grunts ) WE MADE IT.

410
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,583
- I'M SO TIRED.

411
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:05,000
- HUH.  LOOK WHO SURVIVED.

412
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:09,458
- ( theme music playing )

413
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:16,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

414
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:40,000
- ♪ CONTROL, CONTROL ♪

415
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:43,541
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO,
SHE IS LOCO, I SAID, "OH, NO!" ♪

416
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,708
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO, SHE IS LOCO,
I SAID, "OH, NO!" ♪
