1
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,125
- ♪ HER NAME IS KOKO... ♪

2
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,833
- DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO TALK?
IT'S AKIHIKO TOJO.

3
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,875
- DIDN'T THINK I'D HEAR YOUR
VOICE TODAY. IT'S BEEN AGES.

4
00:00:16,958 --> 00:00:18,666
- I'D LIKE YOU TO PULL OUT
OF THE CONFLICT

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,375
CONCERNING KASPER'S
SOUTHEAST ASIAN TRADE ROUTE.

6
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:24,958
H.C.L.I. IS TAKING MEASURES
TO ELIMINATE THE S.R. UNIT.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:28,208
- COLONEL HINOKI CALLED TOJO
LATE LAST NIGHT

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,583
AND EMAILED ME TO CONFIRM.
HE WANTS TO PARLAY.

9
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,708
THE LOCATION IS THE
PARKING AREA AT UMIHOTARU.

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,375
IF WE MISS THIS CHANCE, FINDING
THEM AGAIN WON'T BE EASY.

11
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:38,625
LET'S MOVE OUT.

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,750
- I REALLY DON'T CARE.
CAN I SEE THIS PROPOSAL?

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,291
- THANK YOU FOR YOUR
UNDERSTANDING, MR. KASPER.

14
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,291
THAT'S VERY GOOD OF YOU.

15
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:45,750
WE'LL MOVE RIGHT
TO THE DOCUMENTS,

16
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:47,291
AS YOU'VE REQUESTED.

17
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,666
- WAKE UP, SIR. YOU SPACED
OUT. SHE'S AN ASSASSIN.

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,750
THE S.R. UNIT'S
MOVING AGAINST US.

19
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,958
- ( laughing )

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:04,875
TOJO, YOU WERE WAY
OFF THE MARK ON THIS ONE.

21
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,125
BUT THIS IS NO STRIKE,
HE'S JUST TESTING ME.

22
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,458
COLONEL HINOKI NEEDS
TO STOP PLAYING

23
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,791
AND BRING ME A REAL FIGHT.

24
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,375
WHATEVER.

25
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,875
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU KILL 'EM ALL.

26
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,833
- ( theme music playing )


27
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:16,833
- TOJO, I GOT A QUESTION.
- HUH?

28
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,583
- YOU HAD SOME ELITE JOBS
WORKING FOR THE S.R. UNIT

29
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,791
AND FOR KASPER,
SO WHY'D YOU DECIDE TO QUIT?

30
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,041
- WHAT THE WHAT?
THAT SURE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

31
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,500
SO MUCH FOR THE
SILENT UNDERSTANDING

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,291
TO NOT GET PERSONAL.

33
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,791
ALL RIGHT, I'LL AT LEAST TELL
YOU WHY I PREFER KOKO'S SQUAD.

34
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:38,541
WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT--
THE AMUSING ANSWER

35
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,166
OR THE SERIOUS ONE?

36
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,625
- THE SERIOUS ONE.

37
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,250
- 'CAUSE AT THIS JOB,

38
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,458
I GET TO WORK
WITH TWO SMOKIN' HOT LADIES.

39
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,291
- ( all laughing )

40
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,125
- TOJO, YOUR SALARY
JUST DOUBLED FOR THIS MONTH.

41
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,208
- Lutz: SERIOUSLY?  FOR THAT?
- ( men laugh )

42
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,541
- AW, MAN. YOU'RE JOKIN' RIGHT?
- JONAH, GET THIS.

43
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,041
YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW?
UNDER THE OCEAN.

44
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,166
- REALLY?
THAT'S AWESOME.

45
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,750
- YEAH,
IT'S CALLED THE AQUA-LINE.

46
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:11,208
- LIKES TUNNELS, BUT DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT HOT BABES?

47
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,583
KIND OF IRONIC.
- ( all laughing )

48
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,666
- LOOK AT THAT.

49
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,125
- IT'S LIKE A CASTLE
BUILT ON THE OCEAN.

50
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,041
- Koko: ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WE'RE HERE.

51
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,750
- Lutz: 'KAY.

52
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,625
- LET'S PARK DEEPER INSIDE,
UGO.

53
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,583
MORE COVER.
- ROGER THAT.

54
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,916
- Koko: OKAY,
EVERYONE STICK TO THE PLAN

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,625
AND WE SHOULD BE JUST FINE.

56
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,833
JONAH, WE'LL BE COUNTING ON YOU.
- GOT IT.

57
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,333
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN I FIND HIM.

58
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,958
- KOKO, I STILL CAN'T GET A HOLD
OF COLONEL HINOKI.

59
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:07,166
- THEN KEEP CALLING HIM
TILL YOU DO.

60
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,125
Koko: JONAH, HAVE YOU REACHED
THE MEETING POINT YET?

61
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,875
I'M GETTING A BAD FEELING.
STAY ON GUARD.

62
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,958
- UNDERSTOOD.

63
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,708
I'M IN THE RESTAURANT NOW.

64
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,833
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR HUNCH IS RIGHT.

65
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,791
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,750
- JONAH, GET BACK DOWN HERE.
HURRY.

67
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,958
LEHM, YOU COPY?

68
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,833
WE'VE WALKED
INTO THE COLONEL'S TRAP.

69
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:03,541
LEHM, REPORT.
WHERE ARE YOU?

70
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:06,291
- KOKO,
GET BACK IN THE CAR NOW.

71
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,583
WAIT, THAT'S--

72
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,708
- Man: OPERATION COMMENCING,
COLONEL.

73
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,083
- THIS IS IT.

74
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,208
GIVE THEM EVERYTHING YOU GOT.

75
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,583
THE JAKARTA MISSION
WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS.

76
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,541
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

77
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,208
- YES, SIR.
- ( phone beeps )

78
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,708
- WE ARE GHOSTS.
WE CANNOT BE STOPPED.

79
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,875
- GET MOVING!
HEAD FOR THE EXIT.

80
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,541
IT'S THEM.
- TOJO?

81
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,000
- SOMEONE'S GOTTA
GO GET JONAH.

82
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:38,000
- Man: KABURAGI,
THE TRAITOR IS HEADING YOUR WAY.

83
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:41,291
HEADS UP.
- I'LL HANDLE HIM TOO.

84
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,250
- Woman: WHAT'S GOING ON?

85
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,333
- Tojo: KABURAGI!

86
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:12,333
- Kaburagi: DAMN YOU.

87
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,750
DAMN YOU, TRAITOR.

88
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,375
DAMN YOU.

89
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,333
- Woman:
THEY'RE FILMING ON LOCATION.

90
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:20,750
- Woman #2:
WOW.

91
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,541
- I AM NOT A TRAITOR!
DON'T MAKE ME YOUR SCAPEGOAT.

92
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,083
YOU'RE THE ONES
WHO WENT BERSERK.

93
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,833
- Man: UM,
BUT WHERE ARE THE CAMERAS?

94
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,416
- JONAH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

95
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,958
- YEAH, I'M FINE.
- THE ATTACK'S ON.

96
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,041
WE'LL BOOST A CAR
AND CATCH UP TO KOKO.

97
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,083
- THAT'S A LOT OF BLOOD.
YOU OKAY?

98
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,416
- HURTS LIKE HELL,
BUT I'LL LIVE.

99
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,083
- Jonah: KOKO. KOKO!
- JONAH, YOU ALL RIGHT?

100
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,791
- TOJO'S BEEN SHOT.
- HOW BAD?

101
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,208
- Tojo: I'LL BE FINE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

102
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,291
I SCOOPED UP JONAH
AND BORROWED A CAR.

103
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,000
WE JUST LEFT THE GARAGE.
WHAT'S YOUR 20?

104
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,625
- WE'RE STICKING WITH THE PLAN
AND HEADING TOWARDS KAWASAKI.

105
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,541
THERE'RE TWO ENEMY VEHICLES
ON OUR TAIL.

106
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,208
YOU'LL HAVE TO EVADE.

107
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,291
THE LOCAL POLICE
HAVE SET UP A BARRICADE

108
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,416
AT THE BRIDGE ENTRANCE
TO THE TUNNEL.  BE CAREFUL!

109
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,500
- Tojo: I GOT THROUGH.

110
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,333
TRY NOT TO SHOOT US
WHEN WE CATCH UP TO YA.

111
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:23,166
- THOSE DIRTY SONS OF BITCHES
ARE PUTTING HOLES IN MY BABY.

112
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,583
- SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE
BREAKING THROUGH

113
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:25,958
THE BULLETPROOF PLATES.

114
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:27,458
- ONCE WE GET OUT OF THE TUNNEL,
WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

115
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,666
HANG ON!
- COPY THAT.

116
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,458
- SON OF A BITCH, THIS HURTS.

117
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,958
- I'M SORRY, THAT RUBBER
TAPE WAS ALL I HAD ON ME.

118
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,333
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, JONAH.
I'M THE ONE WHO GOT SHOT.

119
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,916
I'M JUST LUCKY WE WERE ABLE
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,666
ANYWAY,
ARE YOU READY FOR ACTION?

121
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,916
WE'RE GONNA SLIP
PAST THE ENEMY CARS,

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,041
NAIL 'EM FROM THE SIDE.

123
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,000
- SURE THING.

124
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,958
- PICK UP YOUR PHONE, COLONEL.

125
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:54,416
YOU OWE ME AN EXPLANATION.
- ( ringing )

126
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:04,333
- TOJO'S READY TO MAKE HIS MOVE.
FORCE THOSE CARS INTO ONE LANE.

127
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,625
- TO THE RIGHT!
- Tojo: GOT IT.

128
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,916
- BULLETPROOF.
- Koko: SUPPRESSIVE FIRE!

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,125
- Jonah: PASS 'EM.

130
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:35,500
- WE'RE CLOSE!
TAKE THE BAYSHORE ROUTE.

131
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,791
DON'T LET UP.
WE CAN MAKE IT!

132
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,750
THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE.
- YES!

133
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,583
- Lutz: ROASTED EM!

134
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,625
- Koko: THERE COULD BE MORE.
DON'T DROP YOUR GUARD YET.

135
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,458
- YOU'RE NOT INJURED,
ARE YOU?

136
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,458
- I'M FINE.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

137
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,166
- I'M GOOD.
- UM, YOU DO KNOW

138
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,708
THERE'S SOMEONE ON THE OTHER
END OF THAT LINE, RIGHT?

139
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,916
- Hinoki: HELLO?

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,875
HELLO? ANYONE THERE?
- YES, COLONEL HINOKI,

141
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,208
I'M HERE.

142
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,000
- YOU GOT AN ODD SENSE
OF PHONE ETIQUETTE, TOJO.

143
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,875
MOST PEOPLE TALK
WHEN THEY CALL.

144
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,583
I ALMOST HUNG UP.
( laughing )

145
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,416
- CUT THE CRAP.
WHERE ARE YOU, COLONEL?

146
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,958
- IF I TOLD YOU THAT,

147
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,500
IT WOULD
DEFEAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE.

148
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,625
- THE PURPOSE OF WHAT?
THEY'RE DEAD.

149
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,958
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH HERE?

150
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,208
- H.C.L.I.'S FIREPOWER

151
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:48,375
VERSUS THE S.R. UNIT'S PROWESS.

152
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,416
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY
THIS COULD GO.

153
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,125
AND THIS IS
HOW BOTH SIDES WANTED IT.

154
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,208
I JUST GRANTED THEIR WISH.

155
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,875
( laughing )
COME ON, TOJO.

156
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,916
YOU KNOW YOU'VE
ALWAYS WANTED THIS FIGHT TOO.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,625
- Tojo: HEY, WHERE ARE
THE CUBAN OPERATIVES?

158
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:22,000
WHY ON EARTH
ARE WE THE ONLY ONES HERE?

159
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,875
YOU GAVE THOSE AGENTS
A FALSE RENDEZVOUS POINT,

160
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,291
DIDN'T YOU?

161
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,791
IF THE ARMY FINDS THEM,
YOU KNOW THEY'LL BE EXECUTED.

162
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:36,208
- TOJO, THIS IS HOW
IT HAS TO GO DOWN.  LET'S GO.

163
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,541
- I WANNA HEAR IT FROM YOU,
COLONEL. AH!

164
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,458
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,
BOYS.

165
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:44,875
I'M THE LAST ONE, RIGHT?
LET'S MOVE THE HELL OUT.

166
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,041
- SO YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THIS TOO?

167
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,875
- SHUT UP AND READ
THE SITUATION, TOJO.

168
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,708
LEAVING THEM
REMOVES A VARIABLE,

169
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,916
AND DISTRACTS THE HOSTILES
WHILE WE DISAPPEAR.

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,416
WHAT'S THE ONE THING
WE CAN'T DO ON THIS MISSION?

171
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,125
WE CAN'T LEAVE
ANY JAPANESE CORPSES

172
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,291
ON THIS BEACH.

173
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,958
IT WOULD UNDERMINE
EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE.

174
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,250
- Tojo: ELITE INTELLIGENCE?

175
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,833
THAT'S WHAT WE CLAIM TO BE.
WHAT A JOKE.

176
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,875
LOOK AT OUR OBJECTIVE--

177
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,875
INFILTRATE A COMMUNIST COUNTRY

178
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,500
AND ASSASSINATE
THEIR MILITARY LEADERS.

179
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:30,791
WHEN DID THIS UNIT
TURN INTO OMEGA OR GORGON?

180
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,583
- ( thinking )
KID'S GONE SOFT ON US.

181
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,625
- Man:
WHAT, ARE YOU SURPRISED?

182
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,625
HE CAME FROM CENTRAL SYSTEM
ADMIN. HE'S A GEEK WITH A GUN.

183
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,000
- Man #2: BEFORE THAT
HE WAS WITH ELECTRONIC WARFARE.

184
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,833
LIKE THEY GET
THEIR HANDS DIRTY.

185
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,500
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
CUT THE CHATTER.

186
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,833
( scoffs )

187
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:54,041
- Tojo: I'M SICK OF THIS.

188
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,916
I LEFT THE S.R. UNIT
THE SAME DAY WE REACHED JAKARTA.

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,458
I'VE OFTEN WONDERED
IF I GAVE UP ON THEM

190
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,708
TOO QUICKLY, THOUGH.

191
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,333
I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW
READILY COLONEL HINOKI

192
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,750
ACCEPTED MY RESIGNATION.

193
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,208
HE DIDN'T TRY TO STOP ME
LIKE YOU'D EXPECT

194
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,833
FROM A TOP-SECRET AGENCY.

195
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,500
WHAT THE HELL
AM I GONNA DO NOW?

196
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:18,375
FOOD'S A GOOD START.
THAT OUGHTA KILL SOME TIME.

197
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,500
ON PAPER, I HAD "DIED IN
AN ACCIDENT" YEARS AGO.

198
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,708
AND NOW
I'D QUIT MY UNDERCOVER GIG.

199
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:28,791
HOW DO YOU FIND
EMPLOYMENT AFTER THAT?

200
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,625
- YO.

201
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,083
- 20 MINUTES LATER,
I HAD A NEW JOB.

202
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:37,416
I FIGURED
SOME OF THE S.R. UNIT GUYS

203
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,083
WOULD ASSUME I'D BEEN DEALING
WITH KASPER ALL ALONG.

204
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,083
THIS IS WHAT YOU'D CALL
A TEXTBOOK CASE

205
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,250
OF "MISREADING THE SITUATION."

206
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,208
- DAMN YOU, TRAITOR.

207
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,791
DAMN YOU.

208
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,083
- A MAN CAN'T BE CHANGED
SO EASILY.

209
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,333
BUT A GROUP
IS A DIFFERENT STORY.

210
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,500
- KASPER WAS ONLY HALF RIGHT.

211
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,458
MEN CAN CHANGE QUITE EASILY.

212
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,833
WE BEND WHICHEVER WAY
THE WIND BLOWS.

213
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,291
THAT'S WHAT
I'M REALIZING NOW.

214
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,208
HE WAS THE BEST SPY
HIS COUNTRY'D EVER HAD.

215
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,250
HE'D SPENT YEARS OF HIS LIFE
DEVELOPING THAT AGENCY.

216
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,833
HE WAS AS SOLID AS A ROCK.

217
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,125
BUT AS SOON WE HAD HIM CORNERED,
HE ABANDONED EVERY ONE,

218
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,333
JUST TO SAVE HIMSELF.

219
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:21,000
- Koko: HELLO, BAHAMAS.
WHITE SAND, BLUE SKIES.

220
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,541
THE GUY HANGS UP HIS HAT

221
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,750
AND DISAPPEARS
TO A TROPICAL TAX HAVEN?

222
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,958
IT'S LIKE
A REAL-LIFE SPY MOVIE.

223
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,125
- SO WHERE IS HE?

224
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,458
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE A
SHARK ATE HIM OR SOMETHING.

225
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,291
EH?
- AH! DAMN IT, KOKO.

226
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,333
I'M HEALING
FROM A BULLET WOUND HERE.

227
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,500
- YOU MUST HAVE THE ONLY
FROWNY-FACE IN PARADISE, TOJO.

228
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:45,500
WE ACTUALLY TRACKED DOWN
JAPAN'S ONE AND ONLY SPYMASTER.

229
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,416
HAVE SOME PRIDE
IN YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

230
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,791
LISTEN, WHEN YOU SEE HIM,
I WON'T TELL YOU HOW TO REACT.

231
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,291
THAT'S YOUR CALL.

232
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,041
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES
WILL BE YOURS, AS WELL.

233
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,416
- YOU KNOW, KOKO,

234
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,458
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
WE'VE BEEN DANCING

235
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,875
TO THE COLONEL'S TUNE
THIS ENTIRE TIME.

236
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
- AH!

237
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,208
( whimpering )

238
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,291
- YOU DIDN'T CRY.
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

239
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,916
- WHY CRY?
THAT'S FOR SAD PEOPLE.

240
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,750
- ( Koko laughs )

241
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,916
LOOK AT THAT!
JONAH'S A PURE CHICK MAGNET.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,666
HE MAY NOT LIKE GIRLS,
BUT THEY SURE LIKE HIM.

243
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,250
JONAH, GO PLAY.
BUILD A CASTLE OR SOMETHING.

244
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,666
- FINE.
- Hinoki: WELL, I'M IMPRESSED

245
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,791
YOU WERE ABLE
TO FIND ME HERE, TOJO.

246
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,166
CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER

247
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:50,166
HOW MANY YEARS IT'S BEEN
SINCE I SAW YOU LAST.

248
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,583
WHAT WAS IT, CUBA?

249
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,500
- PLEASE, COLONEL,
YOU REMEMBER EVERY HOUR,

250
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,708
MINUTE AND SECOND
OF THAT OPERATION.

251
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,125
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
WHEN IT WAS I LEFT.

252
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,083
- KOKO HEKMATYAR,

253
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,916
IT'S TRULY A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'M HINOKI,
THE FORMER S.R. UNIT DIRECTOR.

255
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:10,416
I'M SORRY MY SUBORDINATES
DEVIATED FROM THEIR ORDERS

256
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,625
AND ATTACKED YOU.

257
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,458
IT SEEMS THEY WERE TOO PROUD
TO NEGOTIATE.

258
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,250
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T SUFFER
LASTING DAMAGE.

259
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,291
- I ASSURE YOU, COLONEL HINOKI,
THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.

260
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,625
AND YES, WE'RE FINE.

261
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,541
TOJO TOOK TWO BULLETS
TO THE SHOULDER

262
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,458
AND ONE OF OUR CARS
GOT TORN UP.

263
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,166
OUR DRIVER
WASN'T VERY THRILLED.

264
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,916
BUT WE'LL GET HIM NEW TOYS.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,958
NOW I KNOW
YOU HAVE CATCHING UP TO DO.

266
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,000
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'LL LEAVE YOU BOYS TO IT.

267
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,000
JONAH!
SAVE A TURRET FOR ME.

268
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:41,166
- WAIT, THAT'S ALL
SHE HAS TO SAY TO YOU?

269
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,208
YOU CAME AT US.
- YOUR BOSS IS PRACTICAL.

270
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,458
ALL SHE SEES
IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

271
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,041
I COULD HAVE DRAGGED THIS OUT.

272
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,375
BUT SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS
WERE THE BEST WAY

273
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,750
TO BRING THIS
TO ITS INEVITABLE END.

274
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,083
I HOPE KASPER CALLED
TO THANK YOU.

275
00:16:56,166 --> 00:17:00,666
ANYWAY, HOW'D IT PLAY
ON THE MEDIA?

276
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,500
- I WAS BUSY FLEEING JAPAN,

277
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,708
SO I ONLY CAUGHT
THE INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

278
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,291
THEY TOTALLY PLAYED DOWN
THE GUNFIGHT AROUND THE TUNNEL.

279
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,166
SAID SOME JUNKIES
WENT ON A JOY RIDE

280
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,875
SHOOTING THEIR GUNS IN THE AIR,

281
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,041
LOST CONTROL OF THEIR VEHICLES
AND WENT UP IN FLAMES.

282
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,666
BUT LUCKILY,
NO CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

283
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,791
- MEANWHILE,
THE BODIES OF A BUNCH

284
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,708
OF LONG-DEAD J.S.D.F. OFFICERS
FINALLY TURNED UP.

285
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,916
AND THE INCIDENT IN JAKARTA
GOT A SIMILAR TREATMENT.

286
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,875
EVEN A MONKEY IN A SUIT
WOULD KNOW

287
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,875
NOT TO LET THE REAL STORY
GO PUBLIC.

288
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,916
- THE WHOLE S.R. UNIT,
GONE IN A DAY.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,083
I'VE NEVER SEEN KASPER
SO HAPPY.

290
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,166
HE WAS PRACTICALLY DANCING
ON HIS DESK.

291
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,750
- I'M SURE.

292
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,375
- I MISJUDGED YOU.

293
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,208
EVERYTHING PROCEEDED
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF

294
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,250
HOW I WAS EXPECTING.

295
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:49,208
SO WHY DID YOU
DESERT THE S.R. UNIT?

296
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,916
- BECAUSE IT WAS THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,208
I KNEW
WHAT YOU THOUGHT I WOULD DO

298
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:58,625
AND PLANNED ACCORDINGLY.
AND I DIDN'T DESERT THEM.

299
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,291
THEY WERE NEVER HAPPY
AS GHOSTS.

300
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,833
THEY WANTED TO GO OUT WITH A
FIGHT AND I MADE IT HAPPEN.

301
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:10,125
- AND YOU THOUGHT THAT BY
SURRENDERING THE TRADE ROUTE,

302
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,916
YOU'D MAKE KASPER'S AND KOKO'S
DREAMS COME TRUE AS WELL.

303
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,458
RIGHT?

304
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,458
- AND MY DREAM TOO.
YES.

305
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,666
IF I HAVE ONE REGRET,

306
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,416
IT'S THAT I COULDN'T STOP THE
ORGANIZATION FROM EVOLVING.

307
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,875
THE S.R. SURVIVED BY BUYING
AND SELLING WEAPONS.

308
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,125
BUT LIVING IN THAT WORLD
CHANGED US--

309
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,041
CHANGED OUR GOALS,
CHANGED MY MEN.

310
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,791
MAKES ME WONDER
HOW YOUR UNIT'S GONNA HOLD UP.

311
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,250
ENOUGH OF THAT.

312
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,958
JUST THINK OF THE OLD PROVERB--

313
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:41,416
"THE BIRD MAKES A CLEAN BREAK
AS IT FLIES AWAY."

314
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,958
MEANS YOU SHOULD LEAVE WITHOUT
CAUSING TROUBLE ON YOUR WAY OUT.

315
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,166
BUT IT NEVER WORKS
THAT WAY

316
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,291
BECAUSE THE BIRD THAT FLIES OFF

317
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,000
STAYS IN THE HEARTS
OF ALL THE OTHERS.

318
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,625
THOSE THAT CAN'T COMPREHEND
WHY THE BIRD LEFT

319
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,250
WILL VIEW HIM AS A TRAITOR
TO HIS FLOCK.

320
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,541
WHILE THOSE THAT WANNA FLY AWAY
BUT CAN'T

321
00:18:57,625 --> 00:19:00,250
WILL ENVY HIM
WITH ALL THEIR BEING.

322
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,083
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
YOU WOULD COME BACK CRYING

323
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,500
20 MINUTES AFTER YOU
LEFT MY OFFICE THAT DAY,

324
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:06,625
BUT I WAS WRONG.

325
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,875
AND YET OF EVERYONE
IN THAT UNIT,

326
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,041
YOU'VE HAD THE MOST EXPERIENCE
WALKING IN THE TRENCHES OF HELL.

327
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,250
IT'S IRONIC.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

328
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:19,208
EVERYONE IN THE S.R. UNIT
WAS JEALOUS OF YA, TOJO,

329
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,583
BECAUSE YOU KNEW 
WHEN TO FLY AWAY.

330
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,750
WELL, 'BOUT TIME I HEAD HOME.

331
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,625
THANKS FOR THE INFORMATION.

332
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,833
WHEN I SAW YOU'D FOUND ME,
I CONSIDERED MOVING AGAIN,

333
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,083
BUT THAT DOESN'T
SEEM NECESSARY.

334
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:38,666
COME VISIT AGAIN SOMETIME.
DRINKS ARE ON ME.

335
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,375
( laughing )
- THAT WON'T BE HAPPENING.

336
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,791
- MANA, TIME TO GO.

337
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,750
- OKAY!  COMING, DADDY.
- Both: OH!

338
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,958
- THANKS FOR PLAYING
CASTLES WITH ME. IT WAS FUN.

339
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,833
( laughing )

340
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,333
- Tojo's voice: HE'S GOT A SHAM
MARRIAGE WITH SOME THAI WOMAN.

341
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,958
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
HE KEEPS ALL HIS LIES STRAIGHT.

342
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,833
- BYE-BYE.

343
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:16,541
- MANA, DARLING,
LUNCH IS READY!

344
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,208
- OKAY.
- OH, DO WE HAVE GUESTS?

345
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,541
- ( laughs )

346
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,500
- ( laughs nervously )

347
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,666
- ( both laughing )

348
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,958
- HEY, TOJO?

349
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,083
I HAVE NO DOUBT
YOU WILL BE BACK SOMEDAY.

350
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,166
AND WHEN YOU DO,
I'LL TEACH YOU ALL I KNOW,

351
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,208
MAKE YOU A FIRST-RATE SPOOK.

352
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:47,958
- I TOLD YOU, COLONEL,
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

353
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,750
I'M NOT SPY MATERIAL,
I'M NOT WIRED LIKE YOU.

354
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,375
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.

355
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,500
ANY DECENT SPY
THINKS FIVE YEARS IN ADVANCE

356
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,625
WHEN MAKING HIS PLANS.
YOU'RE THE ONLY SURVIVING MEMBER

357
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:03,333
OF THE S.R. UNIT
FOR A REASON, TOJO.

358
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:04,958
BE SEEING YA.

359
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,041
- Tojo: KOKO, WHAT'S WRONG?

360
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:22,791
- I PROMISE, YOU'LL BE WORKING
FOR ME FOR YEARS TO COME.

361
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:26,333
- WHAT?  DON'T TELL ME
YOU TOOK HIS RAMBLING SERIOUSLY.

362
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,125
- ( groans )

363
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,750
YOU'RE MY BITCH, TOJO!
SAY IT.

364
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,583
- AGAIN WITH THE SHOULDER!
COME ON.

365
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,250
I'M YOUR BITCH!
I'M YOUR BITCH!

366
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,916
JUST STOP.
- YOU BETTER MEAN IT!

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,583
- I MEAN IT!  I DO!
PLEASE, THAT HURTS.

368
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,958
- DON'T YOU LIE TO ME, MISTER.
I'M HOLDING YOU TO THAT!

369
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,333
I HAVE PEOPLE--
THEY'LL HUNT YOU DOWN!

370
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:49,583
- OKAY!  OKAY, I GOT IT.
- YOU'RE MINE FOREVER!

371
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:51,500
AND YOU'LL ALWAYS
THINK I'M HOT.

372
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,916
- I'M YOURS FOREVER.
I'LL ALWAYS THINK YOU'RE HOT!

373
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,166
