1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:10,916
- ( gunfire )

2
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,250
- Man: WHAT, THAT'S IT?

3
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,916
AW, THIS PIECE OF CRAP BARELY
OFFERED UP ANY RESISTANCE.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,125
A TRUE VIRTUOSO NEEDS A GOOD
CHALLENGE TO PROVE HIS TALENT.

5
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:51,458
- YOU OUTPLAYED THEM, MAESTRO.
- OF COURSE.

6
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,583
THESE PHILISTINES DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING

7
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,541
ABOUT THE MUSICALITY
OF GUNFIRE.

8
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:59,208
SO YOU HIGH-TAILED IT ALL
THE WAY FROM ITALY ONLY TO LAND

9
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:03,458
IN A DESERT IN THE MIDDLE OF--
THE FUCK ARE WE, CHINATSU?

10
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,875
- MIDDLE EAST.
SOMEWHERE IN OMAN, I THINK.

11
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,958
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT
WHEN I WAS HUNTING YOU?

12
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,166
"THESE GUYS MAY BE IDIOTS,
BUT THEY'RE PACKING

13
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,791
AND THEY KNOW HOW TO FIGHT.

14
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,250
THE MUSIC OF OUR ENCOUNTER IS
GONNA BE AN EPIC CONCERT

15
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,250
WORTHY OF LEGEND."

16
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,916
BUT, MAN, WAS I WRONG.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,833
MY EX-WIFE USED TO PUT UP
A BETTER FIGHT THAN THIS.

18
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,125
- YOU'RE ORCHESTRA--

19
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,916
- GO ON, CHINATSU.  ASK HIM.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,916
- HUH?  ASK WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,916
I WANNA KNOW HOW A MAFIA
LIEUTENANT THINKS HE CAN STEAL

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,375
FROM HIS BOSS
AND GET AWAY WITH IT.

23
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,666
HE HAD TO KNOW HIS NAME
WOULD GET ON A HIT LIST

24
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,208
AFTER THE SHIT HE PULLED.
- RIGHT.  YOU HEARD THE MAN.

25
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:44,500
YOU KNEW HOW THIS WOULD END, BUT
YOU WENT THROUGH WITH IT ANYWAY.

26
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,958
WHY?  WE'D LIKE TO KNOW.

27
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,416
- BITCH HAS PSYCHO EYES.

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,375
( laughs ) FUNNY STORY.

29
00:01:57,458 --> 00:01:59,083
I DON'T REMEMBER.

30
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,125
NOW THEN,
YOU TELL ME SOMETHING.

31
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,583
- HUH?

32
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,625
- WHAT THE HELL'S
WITH GOING COMMANDO?

33
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,125
DO YOU GET SOME SORT OF
SICK THRILL OUT OF THIS?

34
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,583
I SWEAR, ALL HIT MEN
ARE BAT-SHIT INSANE.

35
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:12,208
FUCK YOURSELF.

36
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,708
- I GUESS HE DOESN'T WANT
TO ANSWER OUR QUESTION.

37
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:19,666
TOO BAD.  YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
GETTING SCREWED, THOUGH, PAL,

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,500
AND DON'T EXPECT ME
TO BE GENTLE.

39
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:24,375
YOU SEE,
WE'RE GETTING PAID EXTRA

40
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,250
TO MAKE SURE YOU SUFFER.

41
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,666
- YOU POOR FOOL.
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET AWAY,

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,333
BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS PEOPLE
LIKE US AROUND TO PUNISH BOYS

43
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,791
WHO STICK THEIR HANDS
IN THE COOKIE JAR.

44
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:38,666
- ( grunts )
YOU'RE NUTS, BOTH OF YOU.

45
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,291
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A MUSIC BOX

46
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,541
MY PARTNER HERE'S GREAT
AT MAKING THIS SORT OF THING.

47
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,458
- BANG.  BANG-BANG.

48
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:50,833
THIS BABY'LL FIRE ALL OF ITS
BULLETS RIGHT IN THE SAME SPOT.

49
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:54,250
THERE WON'T BE VERY MUCH OF YOU
LEFT BY THE TIME IT'S DONE.

50
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,875
- YOU BASTARDS.
I'LL KILL YOU!

51
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,833
WAIT, THE JOKE'S OVER.
- SEE YA.

52
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,583
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

53
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,958
ORCHESTRA, GET BACK HERE
AND TURN THIS THING OFF.

54
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,916
I'M SURE WE CAN MAKE
SOME KIND OF A DEAL.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,666
( screaming )

56
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,208
- AT LEAST HE'S GOT A BETTER
SINGING VOICE THAN I EXPECTED.

57
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,791
- SO WHAT DO WE HAVE NEXT
ON THE PLAY LIST?

58
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:21,125
- WHILE WE'RE HERE, LET'S SEE
ABOUT ANOTHER JOB IN THE AREA.

59
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,166
- THINK WE CAN?
- SURE, SPRING'S A GOOD TIME

60
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,500
TO BE A HIT MAN.  PEOPLE LIKE
TO GET THEIR BUSINESS OVER WITH

61
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,375
BEFORE THE WEATHER GETS
TOO WARM.

62
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,083
- SOUNDS GOOD.
- OH, AND BY THE WAY,

63
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,958
WHY AREN'T YOU WEARING
ANY UNDERWEAR?

64
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,208
- MY SECRET.
WANNA TAKE A PEEK?

65
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,083
- YOU COULD TAKE IT ALL OFF
AND I STILL WOULDN'T CARE

66
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,375
FEW YEARS AND MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE
SOME ASSETS WORTH LOOKING AT.

67
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,625
COME ON,
LET'S HEAD FOR THE CITY.

68
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,041
- TOTALLY.

69
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,708
- ( theme music playing )

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,583
- YOU THINK ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW TO DO YOUR JOB

71
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,833
IS WHERE TO SHOOT,

72
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,875
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE
WE EXPERIENCED ADULTS

73
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:41,625
CAN TEACH YOU. FOR STARTERS,
THERE'S GENERAL SOCIAL GRACES,

74
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,875
LIKE GREETING PEOPLE.

75
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,541
THEN, HISTORY,
MATH, SCIENCE,

76
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,875
AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED.

77
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,625
YOU DO HAVE A DECENT GRASP
OF LANGUAGE, AT LEAST.

78
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,958
- ( yawns )
- STOP THAT.

79
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:56,166
NO YAWNING IN CLASS.  YOU'RE
NOT A CHILD SOLDIER ANYMORE.

80
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,083
YOU'RE A PART OF MY CREW,

81
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,125
AND AS SUCH, I EXPECT YOU
TO TAKE YOUR STUDIES SERIOUSLY.

82
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,375
NOW GRANTED, MY GUYS AREN'T
REALLY WHAT YOU'D CALL SCHOLARS,

83
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,416
BUT REGARDLESS, THERE'S PLENTY
THEY CAN TEACH YOU.

84
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,583
- GOOD.  SO LET'S GIVE THE NEXT
PROBLEM A TRY, ALL RIGHT, JONAH?

85
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,208
- AROUND 300 I GUESS.

86
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,708
- "I GUESS" DOESN'T
REALLY CUT IT IN MATH.

87
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,500
- UM, YEAH, I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
SHODDY YOUR EDUCATION HAD BEEN

88
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:33,125
TILL THE OTHER DAY.

89
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,666
- THAT PLANE'S GOT A LOT
OF WHEELS.

90
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,208
- TWENTY-TWO, TO BE EXACT.

91
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,000
SO THEN SAY THERE ARE
THREE PLANES LINED UP,

92
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,666
HOW MANY WHEELS
ARE THERE TOTAL?

93
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,375
- UH, WHY'S HE TAKING
SO LONG TO ANSWER?

94
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:06,291
- A BUNCH.
- ( laughing )

95
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,916
- KOKO,
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,416
- OH, THIS?
IT'S A LIST OF HIT MEN.

97
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,291
HQ KEEPS US UPDATED
ON ANY POTENTIAL THREATS

98
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,916
THAT ARE IN THE AREA.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,166
'COURSE, THIS IS JUST THE TIP
OF THE ASSASSIN ICEBERG.

100
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,541
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE MUCH TO WORRY
ABOUT IN THIS CITY, THOUGH.

101
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:27,583
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD WHEN IT
COMES TO KEEPING PEOPLE IN LINE.

102
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:31,416
BESIDES, I'VE GOT MY BRAVE
MINIONS PROTECTING ME.

103
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,541
- A TWO-PERSON TEAM
CALLED ORCHESTRA?

104
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,250
- YEAH, SEVEN OF THE ORIGINAL
EIGHT MEMBERS ARE DEAD,

105
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
BUT THE LEADER JUST PICKED UP
A NEW RECRUIT,

106
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,958
SO NOW THERE'S TWO AGAIN.

107
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,916
IN ITS PRIME,
ORCHESTRA WAS A SERIOUS THREAT.

108
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,625
THEY ONCE SHOT 20,000 ROUNDS
AT A POLICE SQUAD IN FRANCE.

109
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,083
- SO ARE ANY OF THESE HIT MEN
AFTER YOU?

110
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,083
- OF COURSE.  IN THIS BUSINESS,
ENEMIES ARE A GIVEN.

111
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,833
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'VE GOT SO MANY...

112
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,333
- Both: WE'D MAKE A KILLING
IF THEY WERE OUR CLIENTS.

113
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,375
- ( laughing )

114
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,375
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
I THOUGHT JONAH WAS STUDYING.

115
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,708
SCHOOL ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE FUN,
YOU KNOW?

116
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,916
- YOU'RE NOT HELPING, LUTZ.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,833
THE REST OF YOU, ARE YOU GONNA
WASTE YOUR DAY OFF BEING LAZY?

118
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,041
- HEY, WE'VE EARNED
A LITTLE R AND R.

119
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,041
- ARE YOU BORED HERE?  I COULD
SO TAKE YOU OUT ON THE TOWN.

120
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,625
- OKAY.  WELL, I WOULD LIKE
TO SHOW JONAH AROUND THE CITY,

121
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,750
BUT, NO, MATH COMES FIRST.
GOOD LUCK, BOY.

122
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,916
- SORRY, TOJO,
YOU'RE STUCK HERE.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
BUT I'LL BRING BACK SOME
LOCAL BEER FOR YOUR TROUBLE.

124
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,250
- COOL.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

125
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,250
JONAH, BE SURE TO THANK YOUR
TEACHER WHEN THE LESSON'S OVER.

126
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,791
- NOW--
- GOTTA PEE.

127
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:55,083
- ( sighs )

128
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,500
YO.

129
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,541
WHAT?

130
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,250
THAT LITTLE SHIT!

131
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,708
THE KID KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE A GETAWAY.

132
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,250
I GUESS WE'RE ALL GONNA
HAVE TO STAY ON OUR TOES.

133
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,750
OTHERWISE, HE'S GONNA
BE TAKING US TO SCHOOL.

134
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,750
- ( speaks Italian )

135
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,875
- HMM?  WHAT'S WITH THE RANDOM
SWITCH TO ITALIAN?

136
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,250
- AND ANOTHER THING
WHAT'S WITH THE LAME-ASS HAT?

137
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:55,041
IT'S BLOCKING YOUR VISION.
LOSE IT NOW.

138
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,250
- HOW CAN I THROW THIS AWAY
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE

139
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,000
WHO GAVE IT TO ME?

140
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:01,916
YOU LOOK AT THE SKY WHEN YOU
WALK.  I LOOK AT THE GROUND.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,666
THAT WAY, I CAN BE DOUBLE-SURE
YOU'RE SAFE.  HUH?

142
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,375
WHAT A CUTIE.

143
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,750
LOOK AT THAT BOY WITH THE SILVER
HAIR, SO ADORBS.

144
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,500
THERE, SEE?

145
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,708
- AWW, HE'S GONE.
- DON'T LOSE FOCUS.

146
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,458
WE SHOULD HAVE A VISUAL
ON THE TARGET ANY MINUTE.

147
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:36,250
- MMM!  THAT IS A BEAUTY.

148
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:39,000
I JUST LOVE DUTY-FREE
COUNTRIES.

149
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:43,250
- MOST GIRLS KOKO'S AGE WOULD BE
DROOLING LIKE THIS

150
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,875
OVER HIGH-END CLOTHES OR MAKEUP.

151
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,875
THEY'D GET EXCITED
ABOUT A PRETTY WATCH,

152
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:48,916
BUT NOT ONE THAT'S
SO PRACTIC--

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,166
- SOLD!
- I KNOW.

154
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,583
WHY DON'T I BUY IT AS
A PRESENT FOR YOU?

155
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:56,333
- I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.

156
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,750
- IT WILL COMMEMORATE
OUR OUTING TOGETHER.

157
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,583
MY WAY OF SHOWING
HOW MUCH I CARE.

158
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,541
- OH, REALLY?  ARE YOU SURE?

159
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,291
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

160
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,375
SHE'S GENUINELY EXCITED.
SCORE!

161
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,958
- YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING
AS AN ARMS DEALER.

162
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,625
SOMEDAY YOUR CAREER CHOICE
WILL GET YOU KILLED.

163
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,500
TELL ME, WHY DO YOU DO IT?

164
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:25,333
- AN ASSASSIN QUESTIONING
MY LINE OF WORK?

165
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,041
KILL ME, AND I'LL TELL YOU
WITH MY DYING BREATH, ORCHESTRA.

166
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,125
- BITCH, YOU'RE CRAZY.
LET ME GO.

167
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,333
- GUN!

168
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,541
- KOKO!
- WHOA.  WHAT THE HELL?

169
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,666
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S RAINING
LITTLE BOYS TODAY.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,541
- ( gunfire )
- ( screaming )

171
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,083
- CHINATSU, GET BACK HERE.
TAKE THE ONE WITH THE EYE PATCH.

172
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,208
- SURE THING.

173
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,083
TOO BAD, SO SAD, YOU'RE DEAD.

174
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,000
- KOKO.  KOKO!

175
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,583
- IT HAPPENED SO QUICK,
I CAN'T REALLY BE SURE,

176
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:14,000
BUT IT WAS THAT SILVER-HAIRED
CUTIE WHO CAME TO HER RESCUE.

177
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,500
WHY WOULD HE PROTECT HER?

178
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,458
PEOPLE LIKE THIS KOKO CHICK
SERIOUSLY PISS ME OFF.

179
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,708
I MEAN, WHO THE FUCK
DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

180
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:27,458
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHINATSU,
WE REACHING THE CRESCENDO SOON,

181
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,125
OR MAYBE JUST THE REFRAIN?
WHY NOT COME OUT AND PLAY,

182
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,041
LITTLE ARMS DEALER,
AND WE'LL SEE?

183
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,416
YOU PROBABLY AIN'T USED
TO MAKING MUSIC WITH HIT MEN,

184
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,291
BUT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY
STOP THE CONCERT NOW.

185
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,125
- KOKO, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

186
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:45,375
- I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW
IMPRESSED I AM.  GREAT TIMING.

187
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,750
- I'VE SEEN YOU LIKE
THIS BEFORE.

188
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,125
SHIT GOES SIDEWAYS
AND YOU KEEP ON SMILING.

189
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,083
- JONAH!

190
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,916
- BETTER LISTEN TO HER, KID.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,833
NOTHING GOOD WILL COME FROM
SHOOTING ME.

192
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:01,416
- ( screams )

193
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:11,458
- YOU'RE FRIGGING NUTS.
- COME HERE.

194
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,041
YOU NEED TO KEEP LOW AND I'M NOT
AS SCREWED UP AS YOU THINK I AM.

195
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,583
LOOK, I'VE BEEN ATTACKED
LIKE THIS SO MANY TIMES,

196
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,125
I DON'T BOTHER COUNTING ANYMORE.

197
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,416
FREAKING OUT'S NOT
GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

198
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,083
EITHER I'LL GET SHOT
OR I WON'T.

199
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,166
I CAN'T CONTROL
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

200
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,125
BUT I CAN CONTROL HOW I DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION.

201
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,291
BESIDES,
WEAPONS ARE MY LIVELIHOOD.

202
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,166
- ( laughing )

203
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,708
- I'D BE A CRAP BUSINESSWOMAN

204
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,250
IF I WAS SCARED OF
MY OWN MERCHANDISE.

205
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:43,791
- GOOD THING I CAME PREPARED
TO BLOW HER HEAD OFF.

206
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:47,250
MY CHINATSU SPECIAL CANNON
OUGHTA DO.

207
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,166
- ( siren wailing )
- FREEZE!  DROP YOUR WEAPONS.

208
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,541
- OOH!

209
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,875
- GET DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW.

210
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,250
- ANOTHER LAYER OF MUSIC.

211
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,166
THIS IS TURNING
INTO A MASTERPIECE.

212
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,666
- YEAH, KIND OF IS.
OH, HEY, MAESTRO, CHECK IT.

213
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,166
COOL, HUH?

214
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,916
- YEAH, NICELY DONE, CHINATSU.
ONTO THE NEXT INSTRUMENT.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,375
- RIGHT.

216
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,333
- KOKO, TELL ME
YOU GUYS ARE OKAY.

217
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,833
- Koko: LOOK OUT!

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,333
- OW!  BITCH.

219
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,416
YOU SHOT ME!

220
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,833
- COME ON.

221
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:43,125
- ONE-EYE, THERE'S A REAL PAIN
IN MY ASS.

222
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:48,000
- ( grunting ) MOTHERFUCKER.

223
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:50,583
IT WENT THROUGH.
SERIOUS AMMO.

224
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,041
- VALMET!

225
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,625
YOU'RE HIT.

226
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:00,750
IS IT BAD?

227
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,916
- I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
FISHY ABOUT THIS LITTLE OUTING.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,416
HOW'D VALMET SCREW THIS UP?
YOU COPY?

229
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,791
WE ARE TAKING FIRE AT THE
OUTDOOR MALL IN THE CITY CENTER.

230
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,708
WE'RE UP AGAINST WHAT'S LEFT
OF THE ORCHESTRA TEAM.

231
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,791
HANDGUNS WON'T DO SHIT.

232
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:18,500
BRING MY USUAL
AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT.

233
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,125
UH-HUH, THAT ONE.

234
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,541
LUTZ, TAKE THE BELFRY.
BRING WILEE WITH YOU.

235
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,125
COME ON, BOYS, LET'S MOVE IT.
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

236
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,375
- VALMET.
- SORRY ABOUT THIS.

237
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:32,708
MY LEG.  I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE MUCH HELP.

238
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,458
- THE OTHERS WILL COME.
DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

239
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,666
JONAH, GET DOWN.  JONAH!

240
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,375
- COME AND GET IT, LITTLE BOY.

241
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:58,416
- ( grunts )
- NO, WAIT.

242
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,916
- WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?
I HAD THE BRAT.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,541
- IT'D BE A SHAME TO WASTE
A CUTIE LIKE THAT.

244
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,875
- LOOK, I CAUGHT MYSELF A JONAH.

245
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,875
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, LEHM?
I ALMOST HAD THE BASTARDS.

246
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:17,500
- CALM DOWN, KID
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN YOU

247
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,541
LOSE YOUR TEMPER LIKE THAT,
AND I CAN'T SAY I LIKE IT MUCH.

248
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,500
YOU COULD'VE TAKEN THEM OUT, BUT
WOULD HAVE PAID WITH YOUR LIFE.

249
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,791
DON'T EVER LOSE YOUR COOL LIKE
THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT.

250
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,583
YOU'RE PISSED THAT
I STOPPED YOU?  FINE BY ME,

251
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:32,416
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S PISSED.

252
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,875
I FREAKIN' HATE THE RECKLESS,

253
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,750
ALL-OR-NOTHING WAY
CHILD SOLDIERS FIGHT.

254
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,750
I MEAN IT.  LISTEN.

255
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,166
IN THIS CREW,
WE DON'T FIGHT TO THE DEATH.

256
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,708
WE'LL KILL SOMEONE
IF WE HAVE TO AND THAT'S IT.

257
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,666
THERE IS NO ROOM
FOR EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE.

258
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,125
IF WE HAVE TO ENGAGE IN A FIGHT,
IT'S STRICTLY BUSINESS.

259
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:56,333
YOU'RE NOT A KID SOLDIER
ANYMORE.  LET IT GO.

260
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,083
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG,
WHEN THE BULLETS AIN'T FLYING,

261
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,166
I LIKE YOUR FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

262
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,291
THE WHOLE HATING
ARMS DEALERS THING.

263
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,375
WE'RE NOT HERE
TO DROWN OUT YOUR VOICE.

264
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,125
I DON'T SEE WHY YOU CAN'T LIVE
WITH AND LEARN FROM US

265
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,750
WITHOUT LETTING GO
OF WHO YOU ARE.

266
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,375
- UP THERE.
- THE POLICE SENT SNIPERS, HUH?

267
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,458
TIME FOR A CHANGE OF VENUE.

268
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,875
YEAH, YOU CAN SEE US.

269
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,041
OF COURSE,
WE CAN SEE YOU, TOO.

270
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
IF YOU WANNA KILL US,

271
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,333
YOU SHOULD TRY SHOOTING
FROM FURTHER AWAY.

272
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,458
- YEAH.
- GUYS, WHAT NOW?

273
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:35,375
- TAKE THIS.  WE'LL GIVE YOU
INSTRUCTIONS AND PROVIDE BACKUP.

274
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:38,875
CAN YOU HANDLE GETTING KOKO
TO A SAFE LOCATION?

275
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,500
- TAKE MY HAND
AND DON'T LET GO.

276
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,208
- ROGER THAT.

277
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,083
- LET'S MOVE.

278
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,666
- DAMN IT!  HOW THE HELL
DID SHE BLOCK MY SHOT?

279
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,625
- 45-CALIBER BULLETS
ARE HEAVY!

280
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,000
- I DON'T GET IT.  THIS SHOULD
HAVE CAUGHT 'EM BY SURPRISE

281
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,625
SHE'S GOT INSTINCTS.

282
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:10,000
- LET'S NOT COMPLIMENT
THE ENEMY, OKAY?

283
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,000
- ( grunts )

284
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,208
ARE YOU HEARING THAT
ABOMINABLE SOUND, CHINATSU?

285
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,375
TONE-DEAF MORON'S
USING A SILENCER.

286
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,125
HE'S RUINING THE PERFORMANCE.
- WATCH OUT.

287
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,333
- NOBODY SCREWS WITH MY MUSIC,
BASTARD.

288
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,916
YOUR INSTRUMENT IS OUT OF TUNE.
PLAY IT RIGHT OR NOT AT ALL.

289
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,875
- MUSIC?  INSTRUMENTS?
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

290
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,166
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT
RETIRING.

291
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,458
BEING IN THE GAME SO LONG
HAS MADE YOU FORGET,

292
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,875
OR DID YOU NEVER EVEN KNOW?

293
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,166
GUNFIGHTS ARE JUST GLORIFIED
FARTING CONTESTS.

294
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,708
THEY'RE DISGUSTING, MESSY
AND SHAMEFUL.

295
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,375
THIS AIN'T SOME SYMPHONY
WE'RE PUTTING ON HERE.

296
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,875
AND YOU'RE A DAMN HIT MAN,
NOT A GREAT MAESTRO.

297
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,541
- FARTING CONTEST?  HE'S PRETTY
FUNNY FOR AN OLD GUY.

298
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,583
DAMN IT, OUT OF AMMO.

299
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,250
- WHILE WE'RE HERE DEALING
WITH THIS DUDE,

300
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,833
OUR REAL TARGET IS GETTING AWAY.

301
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,916
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,916
YOUR NOTES ARE FALLING FLAT
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,041
YOU RUNNING OUT
OF INSPIRATION, PUCCINI?

304
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,500
- SMUG BASTARD!
- FORGET ABOUT HIM.

305
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,583
HE DOESN'T MATTER
LET'S GET MOVING.

306
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,041
- THIS WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR
ONE OF THOSE EXPLOSIVE SHELLS.

307
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,333
- I'M ALL OUT OF 40-MILLIMETER
AND AK ROUNDS.

308
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,041
WE DID JUST GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT MACHINE GUN SET, THOUGH.

309
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,625
- RIGHT.
FORGOT ABOUT THAT BEAUTY.

310
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,458
NICELY TIMED PURCHASE,

311
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,541
CONSIDERING ALL THOSE DAMN
BODYGUARDS WE GOTTA GET THROUGH.

312
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,166
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME
ABOUT THAT, CHINATSU.

313
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,166
I GOT A SPRING IN MY STEP
AND A SMILE ON MY FACE AGAIN.

314
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,083
- THAT'S THE NICEST THING
ANYONE'S EVER SAID TO ME.

315
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,000
- THE KID WHO CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE EARLIER.

316
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,833
HE WASN'T ON THE LIST,
WAS HE?

317
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,125
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,
I'M GONNA KILL THAT INFORMANT.

318
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,458
- OH, YEAH.  TOTALLY.

319
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:53,666
- IF I HAD TO GUESS, I'D SAY
THE GIRL IN THE RIDICULOUS HAT

320
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,500
IS THE BRAINS
OF THE OPERATION.

321
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:57,250
- PICKED UP ON THAT,
TOO, DID YOU?

322
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,916
LIKE A HUMAN WEAPONS
DIRECTION SYSTEM,

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,416
SHE'S GOT INSTINCTS
LIKE A RADAR.

324
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,250
IT'LL BE TOUGH
TO GET THE DROP ON 'EM.

325
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,916
- THAT BITCH HAS GOTTA GO.
- SHE'S NOW OUR PRIMARY TARGET.

326
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,333
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
SPLIT 'EM UP SOMEHOW.

327
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,791
TOJO, SWAP WITH VALMET
AND GEAR ME UP.

328
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,583
THESE GUYS AREN'T AMATEURS

329
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,541
THEY'RE PACKING
SERIOUS FIREPOWER.

330
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,583
- FREQUENCY 817.
I'VE GOT EYES ON KOKO AND JONAH

331
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:23,958
AND WILEE AND LUTZ, TOO.

332
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
- UGO, HAUL ASS DOWN
TO THE COAST,

333
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,000
THEN WAIT FOR MY ORDERS.

334
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,208
OKAY, NOW GET OUT OF HERE.
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

335
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,166
- WAS THAT KID WE JUST PASSED
HOLDING A GUN?

336
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,250
I'M SURE IT WAS A TOY.

337
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:41,833
- Koko: THE RUMORS WERE RIGHT.

338
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:44,500
THOSE TWO WILL HAPPILY SHOOT
THE SHIT OUT OF ANYTHING

339
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,958
THAT GETS IN THEIR WAY.
THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

340
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,833
- YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE
PROFESSIONAL KILLERS, KOKO.

341
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,458
OF COURSE THEY'RE HAPPY
TO USE THEIR WEAPONS.

342
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,833
IT'S MORE OR LESS PART
OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION.

343
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,083
IT'S NOT JUST PROS, EITHER.

344
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:58,125
GIVE A GUN TO AN ORDINARY
CIVILIAN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

345
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,416
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
HE'LL WIND UP DOING SOMETHING

346
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,791
HE NEVER THOUGHT
HE WAS CAPABLE OF.

347
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,375
THAT'S THE KIND OF
TWISTED POWER WEAPONS HAVE.

348
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,791
AND YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OF SELLING THAT POWER TO PEOPLE.

349
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,708
- ( laughs )

350
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,291
OH, JONAH, I'M GLAD

351
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,750
TO HEAR YOU FINALLY
ARTICULATING WHAT YOU FEEL.

352
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,208
I WAS STARTING TO THINK
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

353
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,541
THERE ARE SEVERAL ARGUMENTS
I'D LIKE TO MAKE,

354
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,583
BUT AS WE ARE OTHERWISE
OCCUPIED AT THE MOMENT,

355
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,208
I SUPPOSE THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT.

356
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,125
WITH THOSE TWO POSSESSED
BY THAT TWISTED POWER TRYING

357
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,500
TO KILL US AND ALL.

358
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,333
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BRING DOWN THE HOUSE.

359
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,625
WE'LL PLAY 'EM A PRETTY SONG.

360
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,166
I KNOW A DEATH MARCH THAT'S
PERFECT FOR THE OCCASION.

361
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,875
ENJOY THE SHOW!

362
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,583
