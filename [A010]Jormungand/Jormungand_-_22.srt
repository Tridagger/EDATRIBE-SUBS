1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,583
- YOU GAVE THE GO FOR NIGHT NINE
WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.

2
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:15,291
- SIR, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I FILED ALL THE PAPERWORK.

3
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,625
- IT SEEMS THAT PAPERWORK

4
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,708
HASN'T MADE ITS WAY
THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS.

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,250
- SORRY, SIR, I'LL TRY
TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:23,750
- ( hangs up)
- ( beeps )

7
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,958
- MAKES MY CHEST HURT,
HAVING TO HAMSTRING

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:27,625
SUCH A PROMISING
YOUNG OPERATIVE.

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,250
- Black: YOU SHOULD
GET THAT LOOKED AT.

10
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:30,583
- YEAH, WELL,

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,000
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME
ME YELLING AT HIM GETS YA,

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:36,125
BUT I HOPE IT'S ENOUGH TO
FULFILL MY END OF OUR DEAL.

13
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,125
- IT IS.
NICELY DONE, WOODY.

14
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,083
AND THANKS FOR TIPPING ME OFF
TO THE SEALS' ATTACK PLAN

15
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,208
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

16
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,125
- I CAN'T PULL THIS CRAP AGAIN.

17
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,250
PLAME WILL QUESTION
MY COMPETENCE.

18
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,125
I DON'T KNOW WHOSE
ASS YOU'RE COVERING,

19
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:49,291
YOURS OR SOMEONE ELSE'S,

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,375
BUT ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS REALLY WORTH IT?

21
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,625
OH, WHATEVER.
KNOWING YOU, IT'LL WORK OUT.

22
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,625
STILL, I WANT ASSURANCES
YOU'LL KEEP YOUR END.

23
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:00,875
- THAT CUTE 20-YEAR-OLD REDHEAD
YOU'VE GOT ON THE SIDE?

24
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,791
NO ONE'LL EVER KNOW
ABOUT YOU TWO.

25
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:05,333
- ( chuckles )
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR.

26
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:07,791
- ( rain pattering )
- ( cloth flapping )

27
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,916
- OPERATION IS A GO.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,791
- ( theme music playing )

29
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,625
- ( singing in Japanese )

30
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,291
- THIS IS PET SHOP!
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE HAD A BREAK-IN!

31
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,125
I REPEAT,
THE MERCHANDISE IS STOLEN!

32
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,875
- HEY, STOP!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,625
SERIOUSLY,
YOU CAN'T JUST KIDNAP PEOPLE.

34
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,666
PUT ME BACK!
THIS WON'T END WELL...

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,958
FOR ME
OR FOR WHOEVER YOU ARE!

36
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,208
- KEEP QUIET, DOCTOR.

37
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,166
- Man: AT 1900 HOURS,
EIGHT UNIDENTIFIED MERCENARIES

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,125
ABDUCTED THE DETAINEE
"CHATTY RABBIT'S FOOT."

39
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,791
THE MARINE DETACHMENT
PROVIDING TRANSPORT

40
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,583
SUFFERED ZERO CASUALTIES.

41
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,916
BUT THE MERCENARIES ARE
CURRENTLY HEADING DUE WEST

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
TOWARD THE CUBAN BORDER.

43
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,416
NIGHT NINE IS AWAITING
A GO ORDER.

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,750
- ( beeps )
- Woody: YOU HAVE APPROVAL

45
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,166
ON THE NIGHT NINE OP.

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,833
- EXCELLENT, SIR.
THANK YOU.

47
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,541
- Soldier: GREAT. NOT ONLY IS
NO ONE COMING TO SAVE US,

48
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,041
IT'S RAINING.

49
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,625
- Soldier #2: WHY'D THEY HAVE TO
MAKE THESE KNOTS SO TIGHT?

50
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,666
- Soldier #3:WE'RE SITTING DUCKS
IF THE CUBANS JUMP THE FENCE.

51
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,375
- HEY, IT SNAPPED.
THE HELL?

52
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,500
- ( buzzes )
- HUH?

53
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,458
( clicking )

54
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:17,000
- Lehm: DAMN IT. THINK WE'VE GOT
SOME MARINES ON OUR TAILS.

55
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:20,000
THIS COULD GET UGLY.
- Jonah: THEN WE'D BETTER HURRY.

56
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,208
- Lutz: WHAT'S UP?
SOMETHING WRONG?

57
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,166
- Valmet: WE GOTTA MOVE.
- HEY! ( grunts )

58
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,458
- GREAT, THEY'VE SENT OUT
A STRIKE TEAM AFTER US.

59
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,750
( laughs )
SO ARROGANT.

60
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:38,166
LEHM AND THE OTHERS WON'T BE
TAKEN OUT  BY THE LIKES OF YOU,

61
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,458
ESPECIALLY NOT WITH ME
ON THEIR SIDE.

62
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:43,708
HEY, IT'S ME.
YEAH, IT'S SHOWTIME.

63
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,666
- Plame: DRAGGING CHATTY
RABBIT'S FOOT THROUGH THE JUNGLE

64
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,958
IS SLOWING THEM DOWN.

65
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,416
WE'RE CLOSING IN.
PREPARE TO ENGAGE.

66
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,125
JUST REMEMBER, THE CUBAN
REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES

67
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,583
HAVE SEVERAL
COMBAT BRIGADES IN THE AREA.

68
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,166
BE WARY OF THEIR DISTANCE.

69
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,791
IF AT ALL POSSIBLE,
KEEP RABBIT'S FOOT ALIVE.

70
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,041
HOWEVER, YOU'RE CLEAR
TO SANCTION THE REST.

71
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,250
NIGHT NINE,
YOU ARE A GO.

72
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,125
- ROCKET.
- ( rock music playing )

73
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,916
- THEY'RE HERE!
- ( cocks )

74
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:15,708
- Lehm:
HOSTILES! SPLIT UP!

75
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,125
DON'T LET 'EM FLANK YOU!

76
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,166
- ( whimpering )

77
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,333
( screams ) SEE? I TOLD YOU
THIS WOULDN'T END WELL!

78
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,833
- Valmet:
WOULD YOU PLEASE KEEP IT DOWN?

79
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:44,041
- ALL THIS WOOD AND RAIN IS
A DOING A NUMBER ON MY AIM.

80
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,916
AND THESE BASTARDS
ARE STRONG AND FAST.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,833
WHO ARE THEY?
SHIT.  GOTTA MOVE.

82
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:55,083
( grunts )
ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

83
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,000
MY ASS AGAIN?!  IT'S LIKE
THE DAMNED THING'S CURSED!

84
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,166
- LUTZ!

85
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:13,083
- Woman: PILOT, LOOP BACK
OVER THE BATTLEFIELD.

86
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,791
- COPY THAT, SEARCH.
HAVE VISUAL ON TARGET.

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,541
- THEY ARE RESILIENT.
THESE TWO ON THE LEFT FLANK

88
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,250
ARE PROBABLY SNIPERS.

89
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,333
HAVE THE NORTHERNMOST UNIT
BREAK OFF AND INTERCEPT.

90
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:27,208
- THE PREDATOR'S PICKED UP
SOMETHING FAINT ON RADAR.

91
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,083
- EAT THIS.

92
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:40,416
SPIKE-L.R. MISSILES,
DO YOUR THING.

93
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,416
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,791
YES!
( laughs )

95
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:57,291
I'VE BLINDED
YOU BITCHES WITH SCIENCE!

96
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,208
OH, AND I AM JUST
GETTING STARTED.

97
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,166
- SOMEONE'S JAMMING
OUR G.P.S.

98
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,083
WE'LL HAVE TO CONNECT
TO THE TACTICAL DATA LINK

99
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:11,416
TO GET REAL-TIME INTEL
ON OUR LOCATION.

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,208
- Jonah: LUTZ.
- JONAH.

101
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,166
I'M FINE,
I CAN STILL RUN.

102
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,833
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME OVER HERE.

103
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
BUT YOU'RE LOSING
A LOT OF BLOOD.

104
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,416
- I JUST GOT GRAZED.
IT LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS.

105
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,750
DON'T WORRY.

106
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,333
BESIDES, IT'S MORT IMPORTANT
THAT WE GET MOVING.

107
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,250
( both grunting )

108
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,583
( yelps )

109
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:36,125
- OH CRAP, WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED
FROM THE OTHERS.

110
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,875
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MAP
KOKO MADE US LEARN?

111
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,791
- YEAH, I THINK
WE'RE RIGHT ON THE BORDER.

112
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:46,375
CRAP, WE'RE STUCK.
WE'RE IN A MINEFIELD!

113
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,708
- Plame:
G.P.S. JAMMER, HUH?

114
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:03,041
I EXPECTED A FIREFIGHT,
NOT ELECTRONIC WARFARE.

115
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:07,083
- Woman: NIGHT NINE IS CONNECTED
TO THE TACTICAL DATA LINK.

116
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,000
- WE'RE TOO RELIANT
ON DIGITAL INTEL.

117
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,958
WE NEED EYES ON.
FIND 'EM BEFORE THEY GET AWAY.

118
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,291
AIR SUPPORT?
- WITH THE BAD WEATHER,

119
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,041
MQ-9 REAPER CAN'T
GET AIRBORNE SAFELY, SIR.

120
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,458
- PREDATOR CRASH...
IS CONFIRMED.

121
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,416
THANKFULLY
THE WIND AND FLIGHT PATH

122
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,916
RESULTED IN IT SCATTERING
ON OUR SIDE OF THE CUBAN BORDER.

123
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,583
- FINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS.

124
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
IF IT CRASHED TWO KLICKS
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION,

125
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,583
I'D BE OUT OF A JOB.

126
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,750
- THESE GUYS AREN'T
BACKING DOWN.

127
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:34,250
I CAN SO PICTURE
THE AGENT BEHIND THIS--

128
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,750
SOME UPTIGHT FOUR-EYED
DOUCHEBAG

129
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,666
TRYING TO MAKE A
NAME FOR HIMSELF.

130
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,833
- Miami on phone:
WELL, YOU PREDICTED RIGHT,

131
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,583
THE ENEMY UNIT'S COMPLETED
THEIR CONNECTION

132
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,791
WITH THE TACTICAL DATA LINK.

133
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,458
BABS SAYS
THEY'RE USING PORTAL 16.

134
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,166
SHE'S UPLOADING YOU
THEIR SPECIFIC IP ADDRESS.

135
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,041
I HATE TO SEE THE FUN END,

136
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,500
BUT I THINK YOU'VE
WON THIS BATTLE.

137
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,000
- NO, IT'S NOT DONE
UNTIL THE WHOLE TEAM'S

138
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,125
BACK IN ONE PIECE.

139
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,625
- YOU ARE GOING SOFT.

140
00:08:57,708 --> 00:09:01,333
- MINAMI, GIVE THEM JUST
A LITTLE TASTE OF JORMUNGAND.

141
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,166
- SOUNDS FUN.

142
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,500
- ( rock music playing )

143
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,000
- ( distant gunfire )
- JONAH, I JUST HEARD

144
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,375
FROM THE LITTLE LADY.

145
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,875
SHE WANTS US TO HOLD TIGHT.
- THOSE GUYS IN GREEN

146
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,666
ARE TOUGHER THAN
MOST OF OUR OPPONENTS.

147
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,791
- WOW.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD EYES

148
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,333
IF YOU CAN TELL
THEY'RE WEARING GREEN.

149
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,541
- LEHM AND THE OTHERS ARE GONNA
HAVE A HARD TIME WITHOUT US.

150
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,416
BESIDES--
- EVEN IF WE STAY HERE,

151
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,125
KOKO'S NOT COMING, RIGHT?

152
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:57,208
BEFORE THE OP, I DID SAY SOME
PRETTY CRITICAL STUFF TO HER.

153
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,416
- YEAH, THAT.
- WELL, THE LITTLE LADY'S

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,833
NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON

155
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,541
TO CHANGE HOW SHE DOES THINGS
JUST 'CAUSE I SPEAK UP.

156
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,750
SHE EXPECTS ME
TO OBEY EVERY ORDER,

157
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,833
BUT WE CAN'T
EXACTLY SIT HERE EITHER.

158
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:13,750
HOW DO WE GET BACK UP THERE?
- WILLPOWER.

159
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,791
- ACCORDING TO KOKO,

160
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,916
WE'VE ALREADY WON
THE BATTLE IN THE AIR.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,708
DAMN! THESE GUYS
ON THE GROUND ARE TOUGH.

162
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,416
MIGHT EVEN BE
DEADLIER THAN US!

163
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,166
KEEP WHINING,
TOJO AND THEY WILL BE.

164
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,916
- Leila: PLEASE!
EVERYONE STOP SHOOTING!

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,541
IF YOU DON'T HIT ME, YOU'RE
GOING TO SCARE ME TO DEATH!

166
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,666
- DAMN.  THESE GUYS ARE
MAKING ME LOOK BAD.

167
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,750
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A CLEAN HIT
ON ONE OF 'EM YET.

168
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,375
- YOU TOO, LEHM?

169
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,125
- WHY AREN'T THEY FLANKING THEM?

170
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,166
- Woman: ENEMY SNIPERS ARE
HOLDING THE SEAL'S BACK.

171
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,291
- IT'S THOSE TWO
WHO GOT SPLIT OFF.

172
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,583
- ALL RIGHT, NOW IT'S GETTING
FUN. I LOVE AN AMBUSH.

173
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,375
- GUYS, THAT COVER-FIRE'S
FROM LUTZ AND JONAH!

174
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,083
DIDN'T THE BOSS
TELL THEM SO SIT TIGHT?

175
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,583
- Koko: IT'S OKAY, LEHM.
YOU GUYS JUST KEEP RUNNING.

176
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,291
- ( chuckles )
ALL RIGHT, I TRUST YOU, KOKO.

177
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,833
- Wilee:
THEY STOPPED SHOOTING!

178
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,041
- WHAT THE HELL? I THOUGHT
THEY WERE RIGHT ON US.

179
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,458
- Man:
HOTEL 5! HOTEL 5!

180
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,041
THIS IS ROOM 3.

181
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,333
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
FROM THAT BORDER.

182
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,500
- ( grunts )
- JONAH!

183
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,791
- ( gasps )

184
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,166
- Man: CEASE FIRE!
REPEAT, ALL UNITS CEASE FIRE!

185
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,166
WE ENDED UP
AT THE BORDER SOMEHOW.

186
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,791
- JESUS!

187
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,833
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!

188
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,416
HOW COULD ALL
OF OUR MAPS BE WRONG?

189
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,000
( grumbles )

190
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,250
- AWAITING ORDERS, SIR.

191
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,666
- Plame:
NIGHT NINE, PULL BACK.

192
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,750
( breathing hard )

193
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,500
KOKO HEKTMATYAR.

194
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,416
- HUH.  THAT'S WEIRD.
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

195
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,708
- YEAH, LIKE THEY WERE
NEVER HERE.

196
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,583
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I NEVER SHOULD'VE DOUBTED

197
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,833
THE LITTLE LADY
GETTING US OUT OF THIS JAM.

198
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,750
- YOU REALLY THINK SHE DID THIS?

199
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,416
- Koko:
ATTENTION, DISOBEDIENT DUO,

200
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
GO TO RENDEZVOUS POINT ALPHA.

201
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:36,583
AND MAKE SURE YOU STICK
TO THE MAPS I MADE YOU MEMORIZE.

202
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,833
( chuckles )

203
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,333
- Valmet:
THE STORM'S FINALLY PASSED,

204
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:48,791
MR. I-LIKE-TO-DISOBEY-
DIRECT-ORDERS.

205
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,375
- YUP.
- AND WHAT DO YOU THINK

206
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,708
OF THIS WARM TROPICAL BREEZE
THAT'S REPLACED IT,

207
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,375
MR. DISRESPECTFUL JERK?

208
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,666
- FINE, I GET IT.  I'M SORRY
I DISOBEYED KOKO'S ORDERS.

209
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,666
LITTLE LADY ALREADY
CHEWED ME OUT TOO, YOU KNOW.

210
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,416
- I FINALLY HAVE AN ANSWER
FOR THAT QUESTION

211
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,041
YOU ASKED THE OTHER DAY,
THE WHOLE

212
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,666
"IS KOKO BECOMING TOO AGGRESSIVE
AND DO WE KEEP FOLLOWING HER?"

213
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,541
BUT ARE YOU SURE
YOU STILL WANNA HEAR IT?

214
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,625
I MEAN, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED TODAY.

215
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,708
- ( chuckles )
NOT AT ALL.

216
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:20,416
LITTLE LADY MAY BE
A BIT OFF-KILTER,

217
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,916
BUT SHE WON'T ABANDON
HER FRIENDS.

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,125
- BEST BOSS EVER.
- THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

219
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,500
- Lutz's voice:
LEHM SAID THOSE GUYS TODAY

220
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:31,458
WERE A SECRET SQUAD
OF THE NAVY SEALS' BEST.

221
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,708
NO WAY THEY'D MISREAD THE LAY
OF THE LAND LIKE THAT...

222
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,708
UNLESS...
KOKO REALLY IS OPERATING

223
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:42,291
ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL
FROM EVERYONE ELSE.

224
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,375
- MAN, I'M ALL SCRAPED UP.

225
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,666
( yelps )
- ( blabbers )

226
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,708
- KOKO?!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE!

227
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:10,291
- YOU CAN'T YELL AT ME!
YOU'RE THE DISOBEDIENT ONE!

228
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,541
- NOW TAKE
YOUR TICKLE PUNISHMENT!

229
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:17,375
- THOSE GUYS TODAY
WERE PRETTY HARDCORE.

230
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,875
DID YOU DO SOMETHING
TO GET 'EM TO PULL BACK

231
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,791
LIKE THAT?
- IT'S A SECRET.

232
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,416
JUST KIDDING.
ONCE WE GET TO PORT,

233
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,833
I PROMISE I'LL ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

234
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:30,583
IF YOU ANSWER
MY QUESTION FIRST.

235
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:33,583
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE WANTED
TO ASK YOU FOR A WHILE NOW.

236
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,208
YOU ONCE SAID THE WORLD MIGHT
HATE YOU, BUT YOU STILL LOVE IT.

237
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,000
AFTER ALL THE MISSIONS
WE'VE BEEN ON TOGETHER,

238
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,916
DO YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,833
- YEAH, ACTUALLY, I DO.

240
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,541
I MIGHT EVEN LOVE IT EVEN MORE.

241
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,375
I'VE SEEN SO MANY
PEOPLE AND PLACES,

242
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,708
BUT I WANNA SEE THE REST.

243
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,708
AND THE LONGER
I TRAVEL WITH YOU,

244
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,333
THE MORE I FEEL THAT WAY.

245
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,625
BUT SEEING THE WORLD
THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE

246
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,083
ISN'T REALLY SEEING
THE WORLD, IS IT?

247
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,291
I KNOW THAT WAR IS WHAT WE DO
AND I'M A SOLDIER ON THE GROUND,

248
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,291
ONE WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

249
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:07,958
TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND ALIVE.

250
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,916
BUT I DON'T WANNA SEE
ANY MORE FRIENDS DIE.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,708
LIKE R.
- OH JONAH!

252
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,541
YOU'RE LIKE A LOYAL
LITTLE PUPPY DOG.

253
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,833
YOU'RE EXACTLY
WHAT I NEED IN A BODYGUARD.

254
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:22,500
AND I'LL NEVER STOP
PROTECTING YOU GUYS EITHER.

255
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,291
YOU KEPT YOUR END
OF THE BARGAIN.

256
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,166
SO I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING
AT PORT LIKE I SAID--

257
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,666
NOT ONLY HOW I GOT
THOSE NAVY SEALS TO RETREAT

258
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,250
BUT ALSO THE TRUE NATURE
OF JORMUNGAND.

259
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,208
OH JONAH, IT'S GONNA BLOW
YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HEAR IT.

260
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,666
- ( jet approaching )

261
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,541
- Black: WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES
WITH THE LITTLE LADY RECENTLY

262
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,666
THAT HAVE KEPT ME
AT THE OFFICE,

263
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,916
BUT SINCE YOU'RE IN TOWN,
SCARECROW,

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,375
I FIGURED I'D BETTER
COME SEE YOU IN PERSON.

265
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,166
- I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

266
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,083
WHAT SHE DO NOW?

267
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,583
HACK YOU GUYS
WITH A QUANTUM COMPUTER

268
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,250
OR SOMETHING OUT
OF A SCI-FI MOVIE?

269
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,958
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?

270
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:07,166
- I DIDN'T KNOW, BUT I FIGURE
IF I HAD HER KIND OF MONEY,

271
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,291
I'D TRY AND CREATE
A DEVICE THAT

272
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:10,458
WOULD MAKE MYSELF INVINCIBLE

273
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,875
AND EVERYONE ELSE OBSOLETE.
- ( humphs )

274
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,000
SO THOSE ARE THE POWER-MAD
FANTASIES OF YOUR GENERATION.

275
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,500
NOTHING ABOUT
THAT COMPUTER'S CONFIRMED.

276
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,416
WE DON'T KNOW
WHETHER SHE USED IT ON US

277
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,958
OR IF IT EVEN EXISTS.

278
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,375
RIGHT NOW MY TEAM'S
LOOKING AT ALL POSSIBILITIES

279
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,291
BEFORE FILING
OUR OFFICIAL REPORT.

280
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,666
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS
SHE SENT A SEAL TEAM

281
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,791
IN ACCURATE G.P.S. INFO.

282
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,125
AND USED THAT OPENING
TO ABSCOND WITH A DETAINEE

283
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,500
SHE STOLE FROM GITMO.
BUT WHAT'S REALLY

284
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,083
THROWING US IS THERE'S NO SIGN
THE DATA LINK WAS HACKED.

285
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,791
THING IS,
THAT'S ALL WE KNOW SO FAR.

286
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,250
WITH HER, IT SEEMS LESS SCI-FI
AND MORE LIKE MAGIC.

287
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:48,583
- ( laughs )
SHE'S USING MAGIC?

288
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,125
I'M OUT THERE
BUSTING MY HUMP

289
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,833
DOING ACTUAL
INVESTIGATIVE WORK...

290
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,000
WHILE YOU'RE THROWING UP
YOUR HANDS, SAYING,

291
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,375
"WE CAN'T POSSIBLY STOP HER
BECAUSE MAGIC!"

292
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,166
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

293
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,708
MY WHOLE OPERATION
WAS PREMISED ON THE IDEA

294
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,791
I COULD MANIPULATE HER
TO MY OWN ENDS!

295
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,333
NO WAY IN HELL
THAT'S EVER GONNA HAPPEN NOW.

296
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,500
- ( both laughing )

297
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,791
- WOW. DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN EITHER OF THEM

298
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,000
LAUGH FOR REAL LIKE THAT.

299
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,833
- Leila: WHERE THE FRAK
ARE YOU TAKING ME?!

300
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,083
- CALM DOWN, DR. FAIZA.

301
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,875
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO SOUTH AFRICA.

302
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,708
- WHY SOUTH AFRICA?
AND WHO THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE?

303
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,083
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT ME?

304
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,375
I'VE HAD IT WITH
ALL THE SPY STUFF AND SHOOTOUTS!

305
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,000
IF YOU PLAN
ON WORKING ME LIKE A SLAVE,

306
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:31,458
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SHOOT ME NOW,
'CAUSE I WON'T DO IT!

307
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,833
- NOW I SEE WHERE THE "CHATTY"
PART OF YOUR HANDLE COMES FROM.

308
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:37,291
I'VE COME TO HATE PEOPLE
WITH BIG MOUTHS LIKE YOURS.

309
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,791
INFORMATION IS
THE MOST VALUABLE COMMODITY.

310
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,916
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD
CAN'T BUY THE MOST

311
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,583
CLASSIFIED BITS OF INTEL.
SOME PEOPLE SPEND

312
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,250
THEIR WHOLE LIVES
CHASING SECRETS,

313
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,416
AND MANY OF THEM
DIE IN THE PROCESS.

314
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,375
EVEN IF YOU'RE THE BEST HACKER

315
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,583
AND FINDING
GOVERNMENT SECRETS COMES EASY,

316
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,208
THERE'S STILL SOMEONE WILLING
TO DIE TO KEEP THEM COVERED UP.

317
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,583
WHEN YOU TALK, YOU'RE
SHOWING DISRESPECT

318
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,041
FOR THE INFO YOU STEAL.

319
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,875
- BOLD WORDS FROM A KIDNAPPER!
- FORGET SECRETS.

320
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,375
I'M GIVING YOU A NEW TOY.

321
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,291
DR. MINAMI AMADA AND I
DESIGNED THE PLANS,

322
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,083
THEN WE BROUGHT
IN DR. ELENA BABURIN

323
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,916
TO BREATHE LIFE
THIS MASTERPIECE.

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,291
- THEN YOU'RE BUILDING A--
- FOR YEARS, MINAMI AND I KEPT

325
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,083
THE PROJECT BETWEEN
JUST THE TWO OF US,

326
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,916
BUT WE NEEDED DR. BABURIN.

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,083
AND NOW BECAUSE OF YOUR SMARTS,
MINAMI INSISTS WE NEED YOU, TOO.

328
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,916
( laughs )
FOR ONCE YOU'RE SPEECHLESS.

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,625
GUESS MINABI WAS RIGHT
THAT IF I GIVE YOU A PROJECT

330
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,291
THAT TICKLES YOUR GENIUS BRAIN,
YOU'LL QUIT FREAKING OUT

331
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,458
AND COME AROUND
TO OUR WAY OF THINKING.

332
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,333
JUST DON'T GO BLABBING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, OKAY?

333
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,000
WHO KNOWS? YOU MIGHT SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

334
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,125
PLAYING WITH THIS NEW TOY.
- ( door opens )

335
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:40,416
- OH, AND IF YOU DO BLAB,
YOU'RE DEAD.

336
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,250
( whimpers )

337
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,375
AM I GONNA BE SOMEONE'S PRISONER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?

338
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,375
SHE WASN'T LYING
ABOUT SOUTH AFRICA.

339
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,000
THAT'S REALLY TABLE MOUNTAIN
ON THE HORIZON.

340
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,333
OH, BRR.
AND IS THE GROUND MOVING?

341
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,958
- FIRST, I WILL TAKE THE SKIES
FROM THE HUMAN RACE!

342
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,958
MILITARY AIRCRAFT,
CIVILIAN PLANES,

343
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:23,583
SPACE CAPSULES,
ROCKETS, I.C.B.M.s.

344
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,708
ON MY ORDER,
EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

345
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,458
WILL BECOME NAILED
TO THE GROUND.

346
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,541
HUMANITY WILL LOSE ITS
BEST FORM OF TRANSPORTATION

347
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,958
AND THE SKIES WILL BE THRUST
OVER A HUNDRED YEARS

348
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:33,875
INTO THE PAST.

349
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,041
- ( gasps )

350
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,250
- Koko: AS YOU KNOW,
H.C.L.I. HAS LAUNCHED

351
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,125
126 SATELLITES.

352
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,916
THIS GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM,

353
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,833
IN CONCERT WITH THE QUANTUM
COMPUTER MINAMI AND I DESIGNED,

354
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,708
WILL LIMIT THE
MOBILITY OF EVERY

355
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,291
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM ON EARTH--

356
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,333
FIRST IN THE SKY,
THEN AT SEA,

357
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,333
AND THEN FINALLY ON THE LAND.

358
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:55,333
IT WILL GIVE US
COMPETE CONTROL

359
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:57,208
OVER WORLDWIDE
DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS.

360
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,958
AND WITH THIS POWER,
THE WORLD WILL KNOW PEACE!

361
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:03,750
AND THEY WILL
OWE IT ALL TO ME,

362
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,208
AN ARMS DEALER.

363
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,791
THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE OUT
THERE WHO CLAIM TO WANT PEACE.

364
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,708
YET IRONICALLY,
IT TOOK A WAR PROFITEER LIKE ME

365
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,208
TO TRULY ACHIEVE
A LASTING SOLUTION.

366
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,875
( laughing )

367
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:20,708
I SWEAR, YOU'D THINK
THE WORLD IS FULL OF IDIOTS!

368
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,333
SEPARATING MILITARY
FROM LOGISTICS,

369
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:27,708
PERMANENTLY TEARING HUMANS AWAY
FROM MILITARY AFFAIRS--

370
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,083
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT, MY FRIENDS.

371
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,291
THAT IS MY ULTIMATE GOAL!

372
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,500
BUT YOU WILL HOLD
YOUR GUNS TO THE END,

373
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:36,208
BECOMING THE LAST SOLDIERS
ON EARTH!

374
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,791
AND YOU WILL PROTECT ME.

375
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,000
- ( chuckles )
YOU'VE GOT IT, KOKO.

376
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,083
- HOLD ON A SEC, KOKO.

377
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,875
YOU'RE SAYING THE FUTURE
IS YOU PLAYING GOD?

378
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,208
IT IS SAID THAT GOD
ONCE SENT AN ANGEL

379
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,833
TO SMITE
185,000 ASSYRIAN SOLDIERS.

380
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,291
BUT WHETHER KILLED
BY GOD OR AN ENEMY,

381
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,208
SOLDIERS ARE EXPECTED TO DIE.

382
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,208
IF A BATTLEFIELD SLAUGHTER
IS THE BEST GOD CAN DO,

383
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,375
I WOULD THINK
THAT ME PREVENTING THOSE MEN

384
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:04,541
FROM BECOMING SOLDIERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE

385
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,041
MAKES ME GREATER THAN GOD.

386
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,833
- ( groans )
- ( hip-hop music playing )

387
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,250
- Jonah: HOW MANY WILL DIE?
- HMM?

388
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,708
- AS A RESULT
OF PROJECT JORMUNGAND?

389
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,416
GOOD QUESTION.
I'LL TEXT MINAMI.

390
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,250
IT'S TRUE,
PEOPLE WILL DIE

391
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,583
WHEN EVERY PLANE IN THE SKY
DROPS ALL AT ONCE,

392
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,583
BUT THAT NUMBER
IS INSIGNIFICANT

393
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,375
NEXT TO THOSE
WHO WOULD OTHERWISE DIE

394
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,708
IN THE FUTURE WARS
WE'LL BE PREVENTING.

395
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,250
OH LOOK,
SHE SENT AN ANSWER.

396
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:36,583
SHE SAYS THAT RIGHT NOW
THERE ARE 683,822 PEOPLE

397
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,375
IN VARIOUS PLANES
AND SPACECRAFT.

398
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:40,833
SO ABOUT 700,000.

399
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,541
WHAT DO YOU SAY, JONAH?
YOU IN?

400
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,916
- ( guns cock )
- ( gasps )

401
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,375
- DON'T DO THIS.

402
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,500
NO MATTER YOUR REASONS, KOKO,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!

403
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,375
- Koko: JONAH.

404
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,083
- ( theme music playing )

405
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

406
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,583
- ♪ HER NAME IS KOKO ♪

407
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:42,708
♪ SHE IS--
OH, NO NO NO NO... ♪

408
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,708
♪ HER NAME IS KOKO,
SHE IS LOCO ♪

409
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,416
♪ I SAID, OH NO! ♪
