1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,833
- Man: I HAVE DEVOURED
FIVE CONTINENTS.

2
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,000
I HAVE SLURPED
THREE OCEANS DRY.

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:18,666
THE VAST SKY ALONE REMAINS
OUT OF MY LONG REACH.

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,166
FOR I AM TRAPPED IN THIS
BODY, WHICH LACKS WINGS,

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,583
HANDS, AND FEET.

6
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:26,416
I AM THE WORLD SERPENT.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,541
I AM JORMUNGAND.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,291
- Jonah: OUR PATH
IS SO OVERRUN WITH WEAPONS

9
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,958
THAT SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF THE WHOLE WORLD

10
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,541
IS MADE UP OF NOTHING
BUT IRON AND GUNPOWDER.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,083
AS I CLENCHED THAT TOOL,

12
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,750
DESIGNED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF TAKING LIVES,

13
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,916
I HATED THE WEAPON
MORE THAN EVER.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,708
HERE I AM,
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

15
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,750
AND ALL I SEE
IS A CHANGING WORLD.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,500
- ( theme music playing )


17
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:48,375
- MOKO!  THEY TURNED
MISTER CHEN'S RESTAURANT

18
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,625
INTO A DUMB,
RUN-OF-THE-MILL SUPERMARKET.

19
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,166
- SURE DID, DOC.

20
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,125
IT'S NOT BAD,
AS FAR AS SUPERMARKETS GO.

21
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,791
REASONABLE PRICES.

22
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,083
NOW THAT YOU MENTION HIM,
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

23
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,125
SINCE WE'VE HEARD
THE SLIGHTEST PEEP

24
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,625
FROM MISTER CHEN, HASN'T IT?

25
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,208
- HMM.

26
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,250
MMM?

27
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:06,333
KAREN?
IS THAT YOU?

28
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,708
YOU ARE MISTER CHEN'S SECRETARY,
RIGHT?

29
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,416
LIEUTENANT KAREN LOW?

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,666
- THAT'S "FORMER,"
DOCTOR AMADA.

31
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,791
FORMER LIEUTENANT NOW.

32
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,208
BUT HOW COULD YOU TELL
I WAS MILITARY

33
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,958
WHEN I LOOK THIS WAY?

34
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:21,833
- IF YOU'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO,
YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.

35
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:23,083
IT'LL BE FANTASTIC!

36
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,041
YOU CAN BE MY SECRETARY
AT MY LAB IN MARSCHEN.

37
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,541
I ALREADY HAVE TWO,
BUT I COULD USE ANOTHER.

38
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,333
WEREN'T YOU IN ALEXANDRIA?
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

39
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,458
YOUR SALARY
IS TOTALLY NEGOTIABLE.

40
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,916
BOY, IT'S CHILLY OUT HERE.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,541
YOU'LL CATCH A COLD
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

42
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,625
OH, WAIT, YOU'RE INJURED.
ARE YOU OKAY?

43
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,666
'CAUSE YOU SURE DON'T LOOK IT.
WE CAN FIX YOU UP AT MY PLACE.

44
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,083
THE BIG GUY'S MOKOENA.
TRY TO GET ALONG.

45
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,750
OH.
YOU'VE ALREADY MET?

46
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:45,208
THEN YOU CAN
JUST CALL HIM MOKO!

47
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,125
I ALSO HAVE
ANOTHER ASSISTANT NAMED MALIN.

48
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,125
RECENTLY WE'VE HAD PEOPLE
SNOOPING AROUND

49
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,625
WHO REEK OF THE C.I.A.
THAT OR INDUSTRY SPIES.

50
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,458
WOW, KAREN,
HOW DID YOUR EYES GET SO BLUE?

51
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,750
WAIT, YOU'RE HAPA? WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU BATHED?

52
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,791
YOU CAN SHOWER AT THE OFFICE.

53
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,375
YOU'RE, LIKE,
REALLY STRONG, RIGHT?

54
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,750
I'VE GOT HIGH HOPES!
OH, AND GUESS WHAT?

55
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,791
I JUST MADE THE MOST AWESOME
TOY. IT'LL SELL SO BIG!

56
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,125
- UH, OKAY.

57
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,375
- ( thinking ) LOOKS LIKE DOC'S
TAKEN A REAL LIKING TO HER.

58
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,041
- Karen: GENERAL!

59
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,416
GENERAL!  GENERAL!

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,458
- ( bullet zinging )

61
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,375
- Jonah: VALMET?  VALMET?

62
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:29,291
- I--
I HATE THIS WORLD!

63
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,875
DO YOU HEAR THAT, WORLD?
SCREW YOU!

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,375
- Miami: AH, I SEE.

65
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,666
SO THAT'S WHAT WENT DOWN
BETWEEN H.C.L.I.

66
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,875
AND THE DA XINGHAI TRADING
COMPANY. WHAT A MESS.

67
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,625
SO THEN NATURALLY VALMET HAD
TO GET HER REVENGE ON YOU.

68
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:48,041
AND YOU DIDN'T DARE GO BACK HOME
AFTER ALL OF THAT NONSENSE.

69
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,250
SO BASICALLY, KAREN,
YOU WERE DUMPED IN AFRICA,

70
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,708
ALONE,
TO FEND FOR YOURSELF.

71
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,458
- SOMEHOW I'D FORGOTTEN,
DOCTOR,

72
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:57,666
HOW DEEPLY YOUR CONNECTIONS
RUN WITH H.C.L.I.

73
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,125
I'M SURE YOU CAN GUESS
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

74
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:03,125
- YEAH.  YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH A LOT IN AFRICA.

75
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:06,291
FOR A WHILE, DA XINGHAI
WIELDED A GREAT DEAL OF POWER.

76
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,416
AND YOUR BOSS
WAS DANGEROUS ENOUGH,

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,791
AND EYE-PLEASING ENOUGH,
TO STEAL YOUR HEART.

78
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,291
ARE YOU ANGRY AT THE WORLD

79
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,791
'CAUSE YOU LOST
'EM BOTH AT ONCE?

80
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,541
- NO.
I WOULDN'T REALLY SAY THAT.

81
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,208
- THAT FIGURES.
LIKE SOMEONE WHO RUNS AWAY

82
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,375
WITHOUT A FIGHT WOULD BE ABLE
TO FEED HERSELF.

83
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:24,791
STILL, YOU MUST HAVE FELT
LIKE THE WORLD HAD BEATEN YOU.

84
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,750
BUT SOON,
THAT WORLD IS GOING TO CHANGE.

85
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:31,125
SO YOU'VE GOT NOTHIN'
TO WORRY ABOUT, OKAY, KAREN?

86
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,708
NOW, SLICE!

87
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,125
NINJA STAR. ( laughs ) 

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,958
THIS IS KUNUTTO,
MY NEW ROBO-NINJA-BEAR.

89
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,916
EVERYBODY'S GONNA WANT ONE.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,958
OKAY, LATERS.
YOU START WORK TOMORROW, COOL?

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,708
- GET BACK HERE!
- CORPORATE SPY!

92
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,583
GET HIM. THAT ONE'S C.I.A.!
- RETREAT!

93
00:05:56,666 --> 00:06:00,291
- GET HIS ASS!
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU--

94
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:02,708
IT'S TIME FOR THE DOCTOR'S
MEETING WITH THE DEALERS.

95
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:06,250
WHERE IS SHE?
- I THINK SHE WENT FISHING.

96
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,208
- UH, FISHING?

97
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,791
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY!
I'M SO TERRIBLY SORRY.

98
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:13,625
- MALIN, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO APOLOGIZE.

99
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,916
( sighs )
- HEY, KAREN! PACK YOUR BAGS.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,833
LOOK OUT, SOLOMON ISLANDS,
HERE WE COME!

101
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,875
- SO, MINAMI,
WHY WOULD YOU THINK

102
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,125
YOU COULD BRING THIS OUTSIDER
HERE? THAT'S KAREN LOW.

103
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,833
- IT'S ALL GOOD, KOKO.
CHILL.

104
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,500
DON'T BE SO RUDE.

105
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,708
KAREN'S ONE
OF MY SECRETARIES NOW.

106
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,291
I WARNED HER NOT TO START
ANY TROUBLE WHILE SHE'S HERE.

107
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,583
- BAD ENOUGH YOU SHOWED UP
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

108
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,583
HUH?  WHEN DID DOCTOR MIAMI
GET HERE?

109
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,000
- ( both grunting )

110
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,000
- Both: ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
KNOCK IT OFF.

111
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,750
- Both:
SORRY, WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

112
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,916
- AW, NO CATFIGHT?

113
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:16,625
- ONE MINUTE TO LAUNCH.

114
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,250
- TOO BAD YOUR OLD MAN
IS SUCH A PARTY POOPER.

115
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,875
THIS IS THE FINAL LAUNCH
AND HE'S NEVER SHOWN UP ONCE.

116
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,416
I MEAN, AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE,

117
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,625
HE COULD AT LEAST GIVE YOU
A PAT ON THE BACK.

118
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,500
- ( laughs )

119
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,750
HE ISN'T REALLY INTERESTED
IN HOW THE SAUSAGE GETS MADE.

120
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,625
THE OLD MAN WON'T SHOW THE
SLIGHTEST HINT OF SATISFACTION

121
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,500
UNTIL THIS SYSTEM
TURNS A PROFIT.

122
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,958
- SUPPLEMENTARY NAVIGATION
SATELLITES.

123
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,625
A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
ALLOWED TO OVERSEE

124
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,958
GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION
UNDER THE ULTIMATE PRETEXT--

125
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,041
HELPING AMERICA.

126
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:48,625
CURRENTLY, G.P.S. UTILIZES
24 SATELLITES IN 6 ORBITS.

127
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,916
BUT WE CAN SUPPLEMENT THAT
FIVE TIMES OVER.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,416
IT'LL GIVE US FULL CONTROL

129
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,375
OVER THE WORLD'S
DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS.

130
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,958
PLUS TRANSMISSIONS
AND COMMUNICATIONS!

131
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:59,958
- THAT KIND OF FLATTERY
MEANS NOTHING TO ME, MINAMI.

132
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,875
- FLATTERY WITHDRAWN.

133
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:07,166
- IGNITION SEQUENCE START.
SIX, FIVE,

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,875
FOUR, THREE...
- ALL ENGINES RUNNING.

135
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,833
- ...TWO, ONE.
- LIFT OFF.

136
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,708
- ( rap song playing )

137
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,250
- WAS IT A SUCCESS
OR A BUST?

138
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,375
- SHUT UP, MILDO!

139
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,083
- ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL LIFT-OFF.

140
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,791
- Schokolade:
WOW, WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

141
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,125
IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH
FOLLOWING DOCTOR MIAMI

142
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,416
ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE BOONIES,
SO WE COULD SEE THIS.

143
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, BOONIES?

144
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,708
THAT'S INSENSITIVE
TOWARD THE NATIVES.

145
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,666
YOU DUMB-ASS BIMBO.
- ( cell phone ringing )

146
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,166
- COME ON,
WHO THE HELL'S CALLING NOW?

147
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,375
YEAH?
- ( laughs )

148
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,750
OH, CHIEF BLACK,
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

149
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,625
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?
- AGENT SCARECROW,

150
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,000
YOU'RE IN THE SOLOMONS,
RIGHT?

151
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,458
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP IF YOU WANT
TO HANG AROUND KOKO AND AMADA.

152
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,708
BUT I WARN YOU,

153
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,875
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT IS
STILL IN FULL EFFECT.

154
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,375
TRY NOT TO GET IN OUR WAY.

155
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,291
- WHAT?  SORRY, BOOKIE!

156
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,833
CAN'T HEAR A FRIGGIN' WORD
YOU'RE SAYIN'!

157
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,250
- HMM, STUPID PUNK.

158
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,625
HOW MANY ROCKETS
HAVE YOU MANAGED TO LAUNCH,

159
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,833
LITTLE LADY?

160
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,833
- LADIES AND GENTS,
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE LAUNCH

161
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,500
OF OUR 126th
AND FINAL ROCKET!

162
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,916
- ( all cheering )

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,916
- Man: WAS THAT IMPRESSIVE OR
WHAT?

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,833
- YOU COULD FEEL THE HEAT
FROM HERE.

165
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:49,666
- AMAZING, ISN'T IT, JONAH?

166
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,666
( laughs )

167
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,333
- Jonah ( thinking ):
AMIDST ALL THE EXCITEMENT...

168
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,666
THEY NEVER ONCE LOOKED UP
AT THE ROCKET.

169
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,125
WHAT COULD KOKO AND DR. MIAMI
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING?

170
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:10,166
MAYBE IT WAS JUST
THE OMINOUS ROAR OF THE LAUNCH,

171
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,166
BUT THE TWO OF THEM LOOKED
ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING TO ME.

172
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,458
- Miami: WHERE ARE YOU FOLKS
HEADED AFTER THIS?

173
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,500
- GOT A LITTLE TIME OFF,
THEN IT'S BACK TO BUSINESS.

174
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,875
BUT WE'RE NOT HEADING ANYWHERE
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

175
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,125
- IN THAT CASE, LET'S ALL
GO AND GRAB A FEW DRINKS.

176
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,625
HOW 'BOUT IT?
- HMM, WHY NOT?

177
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,708
WE CAN SLIP AWAY
LONG ENOUGH FOR THAT.

178
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:39,291
- All: YES!  YEAH!

179
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,000
- Koko: NO ONE BETTER
SNEAK JONAH ANY BOOZE!

180
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,291
- HELLO, JONAH.

181
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,083
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LEAVE MY SIDE, DON'T YOU?

182
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,750
- KOKO.

183
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,791
- PROMISE ME NO MATTER
HOW MUCH THE WORLD CHANGES,

184
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,791
YOU'LL ALWAYS STAY BY MY SIDE.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,333
- Black: YOU'VE GOT ONE SHOT
TO INFILTRATE THEM.

186
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,833
AGENT RENATO,
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT IS A GO.

187
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,791
- Lehm: RENATO SOCCHI, GUESS
WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER.

188
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,041
I HEAR YOU WERE A LIEUTENANT
IN BERSAGLIERI INTELLIGENCE.

189
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:23,583
SO I EXPECT A LOT FROM YOU.

190
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,458
THERE'S A TOTAL
OF SIX BODYGUARDS

191
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,625
ON KOKO HEKMATYAR'S
PROTECTION DUTY.

192
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:31,375
THAT'S INCLUDING YOU, SO YOU'LL
HAVE TO CARRY YOUR WEIGHT.

193
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,000
- Koko: YOUR PREDECESSOR
RETIRED TO HEAVEN.

194
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,958
DON'T TRY TO FILL HIS SHOES,
BE EVEN BETTER THAN HE WAS.

195
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,083
YOU'RE EVEN MORE HANDSOME
THAN YOUR PHOTO.

196
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,958
I KNOW WHAT I'LL CALL YOU.
WELCOME ABOARD, R.

197
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,500
- I SWEAR I'LL DO MY BEST
TO KEEP YOU SAFE, LITTLE LADY.

198
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,000
( thinking )
I HAD RUN

199
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:52,166
A PRETTY THOROUGH BACKGROUND
CHECK ON HER.

200
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,125
BUT EVER SINCE THAT FIRST DAY
ON THE JOB,

201
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:57,666
WELL, MY IMAGE
OF KOKO HEKMATYAR CHANGED.

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,208
SHE BECAME THE LITTLE LADY
SHE IS NOW,

203
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:04,541
WITH THAT PERPETUAL SMILE
PLASTERED ON HER FACE.

204
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:09,041
IN OTHER WORDS, I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE REAL KOKO HEKMATYAR.

205
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,458
I SEE YOU STILL
HAVE A HEALTHY APPETITE.

206
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,375
GET ENOUGH TO EAT?
- WHAT ARE YOU, MY WIFE?

207
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,000
I'M HUNGRY
FROM ALL THAT WALKING.

208
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,583
SAVE YOUR WORRIES
FOR YOUR DRINKING.

209
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,375
DON'T GET SO TIPSY YOU
FORGET WHAT WAS SO URGENT

210
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:27,500
FOR YOU TO CALL ME HERE.

211
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,541
- IT SEEMS SOMEONE
AT THE COMPANY

212
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,833
WAS BACKING THOSE THREE
ASSASSINS I TOLD YOU ABOUT

213
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,708
THE OTHER DAY.

214
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,208
OR AS THE LITTLE LADY PUT IT,

215
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,041
"WHOEVER IT IS
THAT'S WATCHING US

216
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,041
ARE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO HIRED THOSE GOONS."

217
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:41,916
- HA! SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S POINTING
THE FINGER SQUARE AT US.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,208
THIS COULD GROW
AND BECOME A TUMOR.

219
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,916
THAT'S NOT GOOD.
NOT FOR YOU AS MY AGENT,

220
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,416
AND NOT FOR ME
SINCE THIS WHOLE MISSION

221
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,541
WOULD COME TO A SCREECHING HALT
IF SHE EVER BEGAN TO DOUBT YOU.

222
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,666
KOKO'S TERMINATION
HAS NEVER BEEN A PART

223
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,958
OF OPERATION UNDERSHAFT.

224
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,875
IN FACT, WE NEED HER ALIVE.

225
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,916
IT WOULDN'T MAKE A LICK OF SENSE
FOR ME TO SEND ASSASSINS.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,875
- WHICH IS WHY I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE BEHIND THIS, SAW.

227
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,125
HOWEVER...
- AN INSIDER?

228
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,500
- PROBABLY.

229
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,750
WE CAN'T AFFORD MORE
SUSPICIOUS INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

230
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,791
I'LL BE FORCED
INTO EXPOSING MYSELF.

231
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,375
THE LITTLE LADY
WOULDN'T HESITATE

232
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,916
TO KILL ME IF SHE LEARNED
I WAS A TRAITOR.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,833
AT MOST, SHE'D GIVE ME
FIVE SECONDS TO EXPLAIN,

234
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,291
IF I WAS LUCKY.
- UNDERSTOOD.

235
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,041
RELAX.
I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

236
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,208
- THANK YOU. MAYBE I CAN
FINALLY START TO BREATHE AGAIN.

237
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:33,458
- BEFORE I FORGET, SINCE WE SO
RARELY GET TO HAVE THESE CHATS,

238
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,666
I'VE GOT A QUESTION OF MY OWN.

239
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,041
AFTER SPENDING TWO YEARS
UNDERCOVER WITH HER,

240
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,208
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE TARGET,

241
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,000
OUR SWEET LITTLE ARMS DEALER,
MISS HEKMATYAR?

242
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,000
- TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, SAW,
I HAVE NO FUCKING CLUE.

243
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,916
THE WOMAN
DOES NOT REVEAL A THING.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,041
SHE'S ABLE TO SHROUD HERSELF
AND ALL OF HER TRUE THOUGHTS

245
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,250
IN SOME KIND
OF IMPENETRABLE MIST.

246
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,000
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHEN I WAS IN BOSNIA,

247
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:58,416
GATHERING INTEL
ON ALL THOSE WARLORD SCUMBAGS.

248
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,791
SOME WERE SMART,
SOME WERE CHARISMATIC.

249
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,916
BUT INSIDE, THEIR HEARTS
WERE ALL PITCH BLACK.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,750
SHE'S DIFFERENT, THOUGH.

251
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,125
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
THE SITUATION IS BLACK OR WHITE,

252
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,583
SHE CONTINUES ON THE GRAY PATH.
SHE'S A MONSTER,

253
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,583
JUST SLITHERING ALONG
THAT FINE LINE

254
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,500
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL
AS SHE CONDUCTS HER BUSINESS.

255
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,250
AT THE SAME TIME,
SHE'S GOTTA BE

256
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,541
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIMINAL
I'VE EVER SEEN.

257
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,791
REMEMBER THAT RUN-IN WE HAD

258
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,958
WITH THE BALKAN DRAGONS
IN THE REPUBLIC OF T?

259
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,416
AT ONE POINT,
THE LITTLE LADY COMPARED BALDRA

260
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,416
TO A MONSTER
OF OUR OWN CREATION.

261
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,750
TO WHICH, ONE OF THE DOCTORS
WE WERE ESCORTING REPLIED,

262
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:36,833
"MAYBE YOU'RE A DRAGON TOO."
- ( Black laughs )

263
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:40,583
- THE LITTLE LADY TRIED TO KEEP
HER COOL AND LAUGH IT OFF,

264
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,500
BUT HER ACTIONS
RIGHT AFTER THAT SEEMED A BIT,

265
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:43,916
I DON'T KNOW, OFF-BALANCE.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,083
I SUSPECT SHE'S AWARE
THAT SHE'S BECOMING A MONSTER

267
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,416
AND SHE'S AFRAID
THAT ANY DAY NOW,

268
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
HER SUBORDINATES WILL SEE HER
FOR WHAT SHE IS AND ABANDON HER.

269
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,958
- HOW REFRESHINGLY HUMAN OF HER.
SO THERE'S THAT.

270
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,958
STILL, I'D RATHER
NOT SEE HER

271
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,791
TURN INTO AN UNCONTROLLABLE
BEAST, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

272
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,791
BUT WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST
IS HER INVOLVEMENT

273
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,416
WITH THAT KOOKY JAPANESE
SCIENTIST, MINAMI AMADA.

274
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,166
WHAT COULD THEY BE SCHEMING?
I'D SURE LIKE TO KNOW.

275
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,208
IF THEY CONTINUE TOGETHER,

276
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,750
THEY'LL BOTH BECOME MONSTERS
AT THE SAME TIME.

277
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,083
I FEEL IT IN MY GUT.

278
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:25,041
CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
WE GOT TO DRINK THE NIGHT AWAY.

279
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,375
- OR, IN YOUR CASE,
EAT THE NIGHT AWAY, RIGHT?

280
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,500
- Both:
WELL, GUESS IT'S BACK TO WORK.

281
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:34,291
- R.
- HUH?

282
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:38,083
I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY
ROCKETS SHE'S LAUNCHED SO FAR.

283
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,666
SEE YA.
( laughs ) 

284
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,625
- ( laughing ) YOU'RE ONE
CHEERFUL SON OF A BITCH.

285
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,333
- WHAT'S UP, JONAH?
YOU BORED?

286
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,666
- NO.
THE OCEAN'S PRETTY.

287
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,750
- SEA.
THE AEGEAN SEA.

288
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,958
- MMM.

289
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:03,625
- THE C.I.A. HAS FOUR DISTINCT
TYPES OF POSITION

290
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,375
THAT OVERSEE THEIR SPIES.

291
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,250
FIRST ARE THE SUPERVISORS
IN CHARGE OF GATHERING INTEL.

292
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,625
THOSE GUYS ARE CALLED
COLLECTION MANAGEMENT OFFICERS.

293
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,833
THEN THERE'S THE ONES
WHO ASSIST OPERATIVES.

294
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,250
THOSE ARE
STAFF OPERATIONS OFFICERS.

295
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,666
THE PEOPLE WHO DIRECTLY MANAGE
OPERATIONS ARE CASE OFFICERS.

296
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,458
AND THE ONES
WHO OVERSEE MILITARY-STYLE OPS

297
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:24,250
ARE KNOWN AS PARAMILITARY
OPERATIONS OFFICERS.

298
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,166
- WHY ARE YOU TELLIN' ME THIS?

299
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,791
DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH
SCARECROW WORKING

300
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,166
FOR THE C.I.A.?

301
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,666
- SURE DOES. SEE, THAT
NUISANCE IS A CASE OFFICER.

302
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,125
HE'S IN THE FIELD,
SUPERVISING MISSIONS.

303
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,583
I KNOW IT'S CONFUSING,
BUT YOU GOTTA LEARN THIS STUFF.

304
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,291
NORMAL KIDS YOUR AGE
GET TO WORRY ABOUT

305
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,625
MUCH MORE TRIVIAL THINGS,

306
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,916
BUT YOU'RE WITH US NOW, JONAH.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,041
I'M GIVING YOU A CRASH COURSE
ON THE C.I.A.

308
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,125
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

309
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,625
THE FIRST TWO TYPES
ARE HOLED UP

310
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,125
AT THEIR HEADQUARTERS
IN LANGLEY,

311
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,666
SO WE RARELY CROSS
PATHS WITH THEM.

312
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,833
BUT THE KIND THAT MAKE ME
WANNA TURN AND RUN

313
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,125
WHEN I ENCOUNTER THEM
IN THE FIELD IS THE P.O.O.--

314
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,125
THE PARAMILITARY.

315
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,291
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CARRY OUT
THE AGENCY'S COMBAT OPERATIONS.

316
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:03,583
NOT SURPRISINGLY,

317
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,833
MOST OF 'EM WERE RECRUITED
FROM SPECIAL FORCES.

318
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,875
THEY REQUISITION WEAPONS,

319
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,000
CONDUCT RAIDS
AND SPRING AMBUSHES.

320
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,750
THEY'RE EXPERTS IN EXPLOSIVES,
ABDUCTION, IMPRISONMENT,

321
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,500
TORTURE, AND SO ON.
YOU GET THE PICTURE?

322
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,291
THAT'S WHY WE TEND TO CLASH
WITH THEM MORE THAN I'D LIKE.

323
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,125
BUT WE'RE AS MUCH A THORN IN
THEIR SIDE AS THEY ARE IN OURS.

324
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,875
OF COURSE, THE REASON
I'M TELLING YOU ALL THIS NOW

325
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,375
IS THAT LAST BUNCH OF HIT MEN--
TOTAL FREAKS.

326
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,541
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM.

327
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:33,375
BUT IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THEY
WERE SENT TO KILL ME BY A P.O.O.

328
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:36,791
- WAS IT SOMEONE YOU KNOW?
- CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.

329
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,791
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE
WHO WANT ME DEAD.

330
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:42,416
BUT THERE IS ONE WHO HATES ME
MORE THAN THE REST.

331
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,541
DAMN IT, HEX.

332
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:48,416
WHY CAN'T THEY JUST FIND YOU
DEAD IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE?

333
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:58,250
- WAIT OUT HERE FOR ME, FELLAS.
I WON'T BE LONG.

334
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,958
- THE FUCK, HEX?
- HEY THERE.

335
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,625
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, HASN'T IT,
SPIN?

336
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,125
YOU'RE RAKING IT IN.

337
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,583
- WHAT ON EARTH ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

338
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,333
EVER HEAR
OF MAKING AN APPOINTMENT?

339
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,250
IT'S OKAY, GUYS.
FALL BACK.

340
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,958
- SIR? BUT SHE COULD--
- I TELL YOU TO LEAVE,

341
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,666
YOU LEAVE!

342
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,375
YOU GOT A DEATH WISH?

343
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,875
- HEX?
WHAT, LIKE A HEXAGON?

344
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:28,125
- NAH, IT'S GERMAN.
SHORT FOR, LIKE, WITCH.

345
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,750
- CATCH ME UP.

346
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,333
LAST I HEARD,
YOU WERE STILL IN AFGHANISTAN.

347
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,250
- I AM. BUT IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THE AFGHANISTAN JOB

348
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:38,833
BROUGHT ME HERE TO BUDAPEST.
AND SINCE WE GO WAY BACK,

349
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:41,541
I HOPED YOU'D BE ABLE
TO FILL ME IN ON SOMETHING.

350
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,125
- COME ON!

351
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,416
YOU KNOW I CAN'T TELL YOU SQUAT.
I'VE GOT UNOFFICIAL COVER HERE.

352
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,833
AN EXEC
IN THE TRADING INDUSTRY,

353
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,250
WHICH MEANS
NO DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.

354
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,791
SO PLEASE, GET LOST.
- GOODNESS.

355
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,166
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT BEFORE YOU
EVEN HEAR WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

356
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,000
THEY'VE GOT ME ASSIGNED ME
TO YOUR JOB TOO,

357
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,250
SO WHY NOT LOOSEN UP AND SLIP ME
A COUPLE OF DETAILS?

358
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,541
- HEX, DON'T.
- TELL ME,

359
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,625
WHY ARE YOU FELLAS
ALWAYS SO HARD ON ME?

360
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,416
I'M JUST LIKE YOU,
TRYING TO SERVE MY COUNTRY.

361
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,583
- YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

362
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,375
IT'S 'CAUSE
YOU TAKE EVERYTHING TOO FAR.

363
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,625
EVERYONE'S SCARED OF YOU

364
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,000
'CAUSE YOU'RE A
TICKING TIME BOMB.

365
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,541
YOU'RE THE GESTAPO
MEETS THE CHEKA IN HIGH HEELS.

366
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,916
THAT CUTTHROAT SQUAD
YOU RUN'S ILLEGALLY KILLED

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,666
COUNTLESS
TERROR SUSPECTS--

368
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,083
- TELL ME
ABOUT OPERATION UNDERSHAFT.

369
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,125
- UNDERSHAFT IS THE NAME
OF A BRILLIANT,

370
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,291
BUT UNSCRUPULOUS ARMS DEALER
IN A GEORGE BERNARD SHAW PLAY.

371
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,750
- I KNOW THAT.

372
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:34,750
NOW WHAT'S THE NAME OF
OUR TARGET ARMS DEALER?

373
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,583
- ( groans )

374
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,208
YEAH.

375
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,416
(laughs)

376
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,125
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT
IS THE COMPANY'S PLOT

377
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:49,583
TO TURN KOKO HEKMATYAR
INTO OUR ARMS-DEALING PUPPET.

378
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,666
H.C.L.I. HAS BECOME
A GIANT IN OVERSEAS

379
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,083
TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS.

380
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,583
SO THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PIGGYBACK
OFF THEIR INTEL NETWORK

381
00:19:57,666 --> 00:20:00,458
AND AUGMENT THE MILITARY'S
OWN COMM SYSTEMS.

382
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,333
WE LATCHED ONTO KOKO

383
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,125
'CAUSE SHE'S THE YOUNGEST
IN THAT FAMILY.

384
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,750
THAT WAS THE BRAINCHILD
OF THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THIS,

385
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,041
BOOK MAN.

386
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,833
- ( laughs )

387
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:16,541
SO SHE WAS THE TARGET ALL ALONG?
KOKO HEKMATYAR?

388
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,125
( laughs ) THAT SLY OLD BASTARD
KNEW KOKO AND I

389
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:22,375
HAD A COMPLICATED PAST,
SO HE USED ME

390
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,541
AS HIS NAIVE ERRAND
GIRL TO BLINDLY LAY

391
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,333
THE GROUNDWORK
FOR HIS OPERATION.

392
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,791
( laughs ) DAMN IT, IT'S NOT
FUNNY.

393
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,791
SOME TRAGIC SHIT WENT DOWN
BETWEEN US BACK IN THE DAY.

394
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,125
SO I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF
TO SEND SOME HIT MEN AS A GIFT.

395
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,250
IT WAS JUST A FRIENDLY WARM-UP.

396
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,083
BUT IT SEEMS
I'VE STIRRED THE POT

397
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,500
JUST AS PEOPLE WERE GETTING
ANTSY ABOUT UNDERSHAFT.

398
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,916
GOOD THING YOU WERE
KIND ENOUGH TO CONFIRM

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,458
WHO'S STANDING IN MY WAY.

400
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,083
AND NOW, MY DEAREST KOKO,
I'LL KILL YOU.

401
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,666
- YOU'RE REALLY GOIN'
AGAINST BOOK MAN?

402
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,833
GET YOUR ASS OFF!
COME ON, HEX.

403
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,333
I'M BEGGIN' YOU, PLEASE.
- WHICH IS IT?

404
00:20:55,416 --> 00:20:57,541
WANT ME TO GET OFF
OR YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE?

405
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,333
- ( groans )
- ( laughs ) GUESS THAT

406
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:00,750
ANSWERS MY QUESTION.

407
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,541
( laughs )

408
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:05,125
PEOPLE ARE DESTINED TO DIE,
AND YET,

409
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:09,208
THEY REFUSE TO FIGHT.
WHY EVEN BOTHER BEING BORN?

410
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:14,125
- I HAD A QUIET AFTERNOON ALONE.
DIDN'T SEE ANYONE OR ANYTHING.

411
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:17,833
- GOOD BOY. 'CAUSE IF I FIND
OUT YOU'VE TATTLED ON ME, SPIN,

412
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,583
I'LL KILL YOU TOO.

413
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,958
HOW'S #24 TODAY?
- Man: THE DETAINEE?


414
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,500
HE WON'T TALK, MA'AM.
WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO?

415
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:38,708
- ( panting )

416
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:43,500
- ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS TELL US YOUR FRIENDS' NAMES.

417
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:47,083
- (groans) GO TO HELL,
YOU FUCKING WITCH!

418
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,708
- ( gun fires )

419
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:59,208
- JUST PUTTING A BULLET
IN KOKO WON'T BE ANY FUN.

420
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,666
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IN THIS WORLD

421
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,250
WOULD HURT HER MOST

422
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,875
AND THEN DESTROY IT.

423
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,833
- ( theme music playing )
