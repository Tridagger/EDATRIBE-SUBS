1
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,791
- Lutz: JONAH.
HEY, JONAH!

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,833
DAMN, I LOST HIM.

3
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,958
YEAH, OF COURSE I LOST HIM.

4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,875
THE KID WAS STATIONED WITH
AN ALPINE UNIT. I WAS A COP.

5
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,916
THOUGH I WAS WITH A PRESTIGIOUS
ANTI-TERRORIST TASK FORCE.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,958
- Valmet: THIS IS
A HIGH-PRESSURE PAINTBALL GUN.

7
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,625
GETTIN' TAGGED BY ONE HURTS.

8
00:00:29,708 --> 00:00:32,625
- YEAH, I KNOW ALL ABOUT 'EM.

9
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,000
SO, WHAT?  YOU WANT ME
TO TRAIN WITH THAT?

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,000
- YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT, LUTZ.

11
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:39,208
PRETTY SURE YOU WERE THE ONLY
ONE TO GET HIT BY ENEMY FIRE--

12
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,125
- ( laughs ) BETTER HIM THAN ME.
- SERIOUSLY.

13
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,541
- TIME FOR A NICE GAME
OF CAPTURE THE FLAG.

14
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,916
YOU AND JONAH--
FIRST TO THE FLAG WINS ALL.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,541
- DO I HAVE TO?
I DON'T WANNA SHOOT AT LUTZ.

16
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,375
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

17
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,750
YOU GET 15 POINTS
FOR EACH SHOT THAT HITS.

18
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,958
AND 30 IF YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE
TO THE FLAG.

19
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,500
AT THE END, I'LL GIVE YOU
A SPECIAL MEAL TICKET

20
00:00:57,583 --> 00:01:00,041
FOR EVERY 50 POINTS YOU SCORE.
NOW, LET'S GO, JONAH.

21
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,458
- Tojo: THAT'S ABOUT
AS EASY AS MATH GETS.

22
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,458
- YOU'RE A GOOD SHOT, LUTZ.
NONE OF US DOUBT THAT.

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,625
YOU JUST GOTTA LEARN
MOUNTAIN COMBAT.

24
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:09,958
COMMENCE OPERATION.

25
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,791
- Lutz:
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO,

26
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,125
WITH EVERYBODY GIVING ME
SO MUCH SHIT?

27
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:16,000
- WIDE OPEN.

28
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,375
- KEEP GETTIN' FLASHES
OF MY SNIPER WORK

29
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,041
SPINNING AROUND MY HEAD.

30
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:23,000
THE TIMES I TOOK THE SHOT
AND THE TIMES I DIDN'T.

31
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,791
THAT ASSASSIN FROM ORCHESTRA.

32
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,125
AM I A FAILURE 'CAUSE I
COULDN'T SHOOT A LITTLE GIRL?

33
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:30,208
I WAS TRAINED
FOR SNIPING THUGS

34
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,250
WHO HAVE THEIR GUNS
POINTED AT HOSTAGES,

35
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,041
OR TERRORISTS WHO'VE GOT THEIR
FINGER ON A BOMB SWITCH.

36
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:37,916
THE SKILLS I LEARNED AS A COP
LET ME BLOW THE BRAINS

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,875
OUT OF THE WORLD'S SCUM
BEFORE THEY CAN BLINK AN EYE.

38
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,958
NOBODY EVER TRAINED ME
TO SHOOT KIDS.

39
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:47,416
BUT IF I HAD IT TO DO AGAIN,

40
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,583
IF ANOTHER CHICK LIKE THE ONE
FROM ORCHESTRA SHOWED UP

41
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:52,333
AND THREATENED
THE BOSS LADY'S LIFE,

42
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,291
COULD I HANDLE THAT?

43
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,083
COULD I MAKE THAT SPLIT-SECOND
DECISION TO SHOOT HER DEAD?

44
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,958
PROBABLY.

45
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,458
I RESPECT KOKO,
AND I WANT TO PROTECT HER.

46
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,500
STILL, WHAT IF THE KID
I HAD TO SHOOT

47
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,083
LOOKED JUST LIKE JONAH?
AHHH!

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,958
- ( laughs )
- JONAH!

49
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,750
I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

50
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,125
DAMN IT, GET BACK HERE!

51
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:18,291
- ( laughs )

52
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,083
- HA HA! CATCHIN' UP!

53
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,458
OW!

54
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,708
THE HELL?
A TRAP?

55
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,750
AHH!

56
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:28,333
AW, SHIT!

57
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,791
NOOOO!

58
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,000
- Valmet:
TWO, THREE, FOUR...

59
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:35,125
- THAT'S MY LUTZ.
YOU NEVER LET ME DOWN.

60
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,291
- ...NINE...
- LAUGH IT UP.

61
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,416
IT WAS JUST A GAME.

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,833
IT'S NOT LIKE
I WAS REALLY TRYING.

63
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,416
- News anchor:
TERRITORY DISPUTES STILL HAVE

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,125
TENSIONS RUNNING HIGH BETWEEN
MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRY A

65
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,666
AND EUROPEAN COUNTRY B.

66
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,000
AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
COMPANY REPORTS

67
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,958
THAT COUNTRY A'S
MILITARY HAS GATHERED

68
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,250
AT THE LINE OF CONFLICT--
- VALMET, COME ON.

69
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,583
IT'S TIME TO GET UP.

70
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,291
- OH, GOOD MORNING.

71
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,625
DON'T WE HAVE A MEETING
ON THE AGENDA TODAY?

72
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,041
- YES.

73
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:01,250
THE UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE
SUPPLY COMMITTEE

74
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,583
IS MEETING AT
COUNTRY B'S EMBASSY IN LONDON.

75
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,833
- THIS COMMITTEE IS DEDICATED
TO INTRODUCING

76
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,416
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES AT
LAST TO COUNTRY B'S AIR FORCE.

77
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,583
WE WILL BE LOOKING AT H.C.L.I.'S
AMERICAN-MADE PREDATOR

78
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:16,458
AND THE EURO GROUP'S
NEURON PROJECT--

79
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,666
- DID YOU CHECK OUT
WHO THE COMPETITION'S

80
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,750
THROWING AT US TODAY?

81
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,666
- Koko: WOW.
- AMALIA TOROHOVSKY--

82
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,708
ACTRESS TURNED ARMS DEALER.

83
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,708
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, HUH?

84
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:29,333
- ( Russian accent )
KOKO HEKMATYAR!

85
00:03:29,416 --> 00:03:31,875
MY GOODNESS, WHAT A PLEASURE.

86
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:33,000
I HEARD THERE WAS
GOING TO BE

87
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,666
A SWEET, FRESH-FACED
DEALER HERE TODAY

88
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,958
AND I SIMPLY
HAD TO SEE FOR MYSELF.

89
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,708
SO THE RUMORS ARE TRUE.
DO GO EASY ON ME.

90
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,875
- OH, SURE.

91
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:45,833
- ( theme music playing )

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,375
- ( singing in Japanese )

93
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:14,791
- Koko: THIS SUCKS.
A LOT.

94
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,541
LISTEN TO THIS, JONAH.

95
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,791
- I DON'T THINK TELLING ME
WILL MAKE IT ANY BETTER.

96
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,291
- I'M GOING TO ANYWAY.
( laughs )

97
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,000
THE COMPETITION IS FORMIDABLE
ON THIS TRIP.

98
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,791
IT'S LIKE THE DEAL HAD ALREADY
BEEN MADE BY THE TIME I ARRIVED,

99
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,250
LIKE I'D BEEN
TAKEN OUT OF THE GAME

100
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,333
BEFORE I EVEN STARTED TO PLAY.

101
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,583
THE RUMORS WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT WOMAN.

102
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:36,708
SHE MOVES FAST.
- WHAT WOMAN?

103
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,125
- OH, THIS MEGA-HOT ACTRESS
TURNED ARMS DEALER.

104
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,833
ALL SHE HAS TO DO
IS CROOK HER FINGER

105
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:42,875
AND THOSE
OLD MILITARY BOYS

106
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,125
COME RUNNING
TO BUY HER MERCHANDISE.

107
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,375
HER FAME LANDED HER
A WEALTHY HUSBAND,

108
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,458
BUT HER STAR FADED,
HE PASSED AWAY,

109
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,333
AND HIS ENTIRE FORTUNE
WENT TO HER.

110
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,916
SO NOW SHE'S USING
HER CONSIDERABLE CHARM

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,333
TO WORK HER WAY UP
IN THE WEAPONS TRADE.

112
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,583
SHE DOES SEEM LIKE A WEIRD ONE,
THOUGH.

113
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
FEW ROUNDS SHORT
OF A FULL CLIP.

114
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,708
- WHAT PRODUCT DO YOU HAVE
ON THE TABLE NOW?

115
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,208
- BRAND NEW U.A.V.s--
RADIO-CONTROLLED PLANES

116
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,583
USED FOR SCOUTING
AND RECONNAISSANCE.

117
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,916
THESE BABIES NEVER GET TIRED
OR CARELESS.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,250
AND NOBODY DIES
IF ONE GETS SHOT DOWN.

119
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,916
WHEN EQUIPPED WITH WEAPONS,
IT CAN EVEN BE USED IN COMBAT.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,375
JUST RECENTLY,
IN FACT, ONE WAS USED

121
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,583
TO BOMB A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION.

122
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,208
WE ARE LIVING IN
AN AGE WHERE ROBOTS

123
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,541
ARE USED TO KILL HUMANS.

124
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,083
I'M SURE ISAAC ASIMOV
IS ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE.

125
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,916
- I'M NOT SURE I LIKE THE SOUND
OF THOSE THINGS.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,875
- HEY, I'M WITH YOU
ON THAT PART.

127
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,375
THEY CREEP ME OUT TOO.

128
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,166
BUT MY JOB
IS TO SELL THE SUCKERS,

129
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,750
REGARDLESS OF
MY PERSONAL FEELINGS.

130
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:37,166
- HEY, KOKO!

131
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,375
UGH, THIS PLACE.
IT'S FREAKIN' HUMID

132
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,000
AND THE SKY'S ALWAYS CLOUDY
AND THE FOOD IS DISGUSTING.

133
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,166
- Koko: BE NICE.
- YEAH SO,

134
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,708
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
PREDATOR SITUATION,

135
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,416
THE AMERICANS
ARE NOT INTERESTED.

136
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,916
LET ME SEE
IF I'VE GOT YOUR BASIC IDEA.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,500
THE U.S. SELLS U.A.V.s
TO COUNTRY A

138
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,000
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
THAT THEY'LL BE USED

139
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,541
TO SETTLE CIVIL UNREST.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,291
THIS, IN TURN, WILL PISS OFF
NEIGHBORING COUNTRY B,

141
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,333
AT WHICH POINT THE U.S. WILL
OFFER TO SELL TO THEM AS WELL.

142
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,375
TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE
OF POWER, RIGHT?

143
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,375
YOUR PLAN
HAS ONE MINOR FLAW, THOUGH.

144
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,291
COUNTRY B
IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS

145
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:12,375
OF DEVELOPING THEIR OWN U.A.V.s
WITH THE NEURON PROJECT.

146
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,541
THE AMERICANS FIGURE
THIS WILL RESOLVE ITSELF

147
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,375
ON ITS OWN WITHOUT THEIR HELP.

148
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,875
- THE U.A.V. MARKET

149
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,958
IS JUST GONNA KEEP
GETTING HOTTER AND HOTTER.

150
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:22,333
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO BE
THE ONE FEEDING THE FIRE

151
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,625
THAN GETTING BURNED BY IT,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

152
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,333
- I GOTTA GET GOING.
YOU KNOW SCARECROW.

153
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,000
HE'LL PISS HIMSELF IF I SPEND
TOO MUCH TIME WITH YOU.

154
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,833
- HMM.
- WHA-- WHAT'S WRONG?

155
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,416
- I FIND IT INTERESTING
THAT A C.I.A. TECHIE

156
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,458
WOULD JOIN UP WITH SCARECROW.

157
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,625
HIS CRUSADE AGAINST ME
IS PATHETIC.

158
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,041
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
I WON'T STOP YOU.

159
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,166
IN FACT, I THINK YOU AND I ARE
GOING TO GET ALONG QUITE WELL.

160
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,083
- UM, THIS--
THIS CAN'T BE A--

161
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,375
OH, HOLY CRAP, IT IS.

162
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,375
AWESOME!
IS IT FOR ME?

163
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,791
- I DON'T WANT THE AMERICANS
PULLING OUT OF THIS DEAL,

164
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,208
SO YOU'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THEM
FOR ME, RIGHT?

165
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:01,416
- SHE'S TOTALLY USING ME.

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,291
I'M PROBABLY GETTING MYSELF
INTO AN UGLY SITUATION.

167
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,000
OH, WELL, WHATEV.
SURE.

168
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,625
- Koko:
UGO, LET'S SWING BY THE HOTELS

169
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
THAT ARE ACCOMMODATING
COUNTRY B'S PEOPLE.

170
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,041
- YOU GOT IT.

171
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,416
- GET READY TO ROCK, BOYS!
WE'VE GOT STUFF TO SELL.

172
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,416
- DAMN.
LITTLE LADY'S ON FIRE TODAY.

173
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,125
- MS. KOKO HEKMATYAR
OF H.C.L.I.?

174
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,166
IF YOU'LL WAIT IN THE LOBBY,
PLEASE.

175
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,666
- ( door dings )

176
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,875
- GENERA-- OH!
- MS. HEKMATYAR.

177
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:31,208
WELL, I'M SURE YOU CAN SEE
HOW THINGS STAND.

178
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,958
SORRY.
- ( chuckles )

179
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,583
- Man: MY APOLOGIES,
MS. HEKMATYAR.

180
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,041
I KNOW YOU WERE
SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH

181
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,750
THE COLONEL THIS AFTERNOON,
BUT I'M AFRAID

182
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,583
HE HAS BEEN
UNAVOIDABLY DETAINED.

183
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,750
- RIGHT.
- Man #2: I AM VERY SORRY.

184
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,875
THE LIEUTENANT GENERAL
HAS ALREADY LEFT.

185
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,375
HE'LL BE GONE FOR THE DAY.
- LOVELY.

186
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,708
- Man #3: INITIALLY,
I WAS ONE OF THE ONES

187
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,458
PUSHING FOR THE PREDATORS.
IN THE END,

188
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,000
THE EURO GROUP
WON ME OVER, THOUGH.

189
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,458
WE NEED TO STICK
WITH EUROPEAN TECHNOLOGY.

190
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,208
- OF COURSE.

191
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,875
( grunting )

192
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,916
THAT BITCH
IS EVERYWHERE!

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,541
- SEEN HER GET HER PANTIES
IN A TWIST, BUT HER WHOLE BODY?

194
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,333
- REMINDS ME
OF RODIN'S THE THINKER.

195
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,541
- ONE PLACE LEFT.
LET'S ROLL.

196
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,875
- Ugo: WHO IS IT?
- LIEUTENANT COLONEL MARQUIS

197
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,333
FROM COUNTRY B'S ARMY.

198
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,875
HE'S BEEN A SUPPORTER
OF THE PREDATORS.

199
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,083
AND HE'S WORKED WITH US BEFORE.

200
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:23,083
- MS. TOROHOVSKY PAID ME A VISIT
EARLIER AS WELL,

201
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,541
BUT I HAVE WITHHELD
MAKING A DECISION.

202
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,125
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

203
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,416
- YOU COULD TAKE IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

204
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,291
MAYBE SHE'S MOVING QUICKLY
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS

205
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,875
YOU'RE A WORTHY OPPONENT.

206
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,041
I IMAGINE H.C.L.I. HEADQUARTERS
HAS ALREADY INFORMED YOU,

207
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,250
BUT AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER
WROTE AN EXPOSE

208
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,000
ON YOUR IMPORTATION PLAN.

209
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,500
- THE NEWSPAPER IS REALLY
NOTHING BETTER THAN A TABLOID.

210
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,666
- IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,
WE'LL LEAK THE INFO

211
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,500
TO A LEGITIMATE PAPER
AND FINISH HER OFF.

212
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,666
- Amalia: KOKO WAS SMART.

213
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,416
SAYING THE PREDATORS
ACQUIRED HAD BEEN DISPOSED OF

214
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,875
BY THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE
AND INSISTING THAT THE U.S.

215
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,333
WAS NOT DIRECTLY
PROVIDING THE AIRCRAFTS.

216
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,041
SHE HELPS COUNTRY A SAVE FACE

217
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,500
BY MAKING IT LOOK
LIKE CIVILIANS MADE THE DEAL.

218
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,375
- HEKMATYAR'S
FANCY FOOTWORK IS HER

219
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,041
MAIN STRENGTH IN THIS GAME.

220
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,666
HOWEVER, YOUR CHARM
AND CONNECTIONS

221
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,875
PROVED TO BE
SUPERIOR THIS TIME.

222
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,333
- Lutz: NOW THAT'S A POSE
THAT INSPIRES CONFIDENCE.

223
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,125
- IT IS. IT'S LIKE SHE'S
STARING ADVERSITY IN THE FACE,

224
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,500
REFUSING TO GIVE UP.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

225
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,666
- SO, IS THAT IT THEN?
WE DONE?

226
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,666
- OF COURSE NOT.

227
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,291
I'VE PLANTED
THE NECESSARY SEEDS.

228
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,375
NOW WE JUST WAIT FOR THEM
TO BEAR FRUIT.

229
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,958
I WILL OUTWIT THAT WOMAN.
IT'S WHAT I DO.

230
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,833
AND FORTUNATELY,
I'M VERY GOOD AT IT.

231
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,416
- R: WILL SHE BE OKAY?

232
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,250
WE'RE JUST LEAVING VALMET,
WILEE, AND LUTZ HERE

233
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,250
IN ENGLAND WITH HER.

234
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,833
- I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

235
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,416
LET'S JUST CONCENTRATE
ON GETTING OUR OWN WORK DONE.

236
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,458
- Mao: WE'LL NEED
TO KEEP OUR GUARD UP.

237
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:53,541
SEE THOSE SUITS OVER THERE?
EURO GROUP'S GIVEN US A TAIL.

238
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,208
- R: REALLY?
- SHE'LL BE FINE WITH

239
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:57,208
THE OTHER THREE.
HAVE A LITTLE FAITH

240
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:59,000
IN YOUR CREW MEMBERS' ABILITIES.

241
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,583
- SO BASICALLY,
EVERYTHING WILL BE A-OKAY

242
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:03,625
AS LONG AS I CAN CLOSE THE DEAL
WITH COUNTRY B

243
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:05,875
QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY.
- ( all laugh )

244
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,666
- All: NAH, NEVER HAPPEN.

245
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,916
- Lehm: THAT'S EVEN GIVING KOKO
A HARD TIME.

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,083
- Valmet ( thinking ):
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THIS

247
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,458
EVER SINCE THE
NEGOTIATIONS TWO DAYS AGO.

248
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,666
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE WORRIED.

249
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,041
CAREFUL, KOKO.
KEEP EATING ALL THAT CRAP

250
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,125
AND NOT EXERCISING
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET FAT.

251
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,750
- IT'D BE COOL IF IT WOULD
ALL JUST GO TO MY BOOBS

252
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,625
AND I COULD HAVE
A CHEST LIKE YOURS.

253
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:30,500
- OH, NO! YOU'RE PERFECT
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE, REALLY.

254
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,708
- ( Koko laughs )
OH, STOP.

255
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,708
- LOOKS LIKE SHE'S SENT
ANOTHER EMAIL.

256
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:37,541
- THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL
TO 25 IN ONE HOUR.

257
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,416
- HA!  DO YOU THINK
WE COULD CRACK THEM

258
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,583
WITH THE HELP OF AMALIA'S
FRIENDS AT THE D.G.S.E.?

259
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,708
- Man: THE FRENCH
SECURITY ORGANIZATION?

260
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,541
YEAH, PROBABLY.
BUT EVEN THEN,

261
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,000
IT WOULD TAKE A HUGE
AMOUNT OF TIME.

262
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,583
HAVEN'T WE PRETTY MUCH
WON ALREADY ANYWAY?

263
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,916
THERE'S NOTHING H.C.L.I.
CAN DO NOW. WHY WORRY?

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,458
- WE'LL SEE WHAT AMALIA THINKS.
KEEP INTERCEPTING HER MESSAGES.

265
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,458
- KOKO HERE.
SCHOKOLADE?

266
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,708
IT'S BAD.
VERY BAD.

267
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,250
YEP, IT'S LOOKING LIKE
I'VE LOST THE BATTLE

268
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,541
OVER THESE U.A.V. SALES.

269
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,833
MY PLAN WAS TO SEND
THE PREDATORS TO COUNTRY B

270
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,625
VIA ITALY TO AVOID
PROVOKING COUNTRY A.

271
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,666
BUT THE ITALIAN PRESS
CAUGHT WIND OF WHAT I WAS UP TO.

272
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,000
MS. TOROHOVSKY MUST HAVE PULLED
ALL THE RIGHT STRINGS.

273
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,958
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
FOR ME TO DO NOW.

274
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,833
H.C.L.I. IS OFFICIALLY
PULLING OUT OF THIS DEAL.

275
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,416
I WILL DROP BY TO SAY HELLO
AT TOMORROW'S VOTE, THOUGH.

276
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,916
- ( laughs )

277
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,541
AT TIMES LIKE THIS, I REMEMBER
WHY IT WASN'T DIFFICULT

278
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,375
TO LEAVE MY ACTING CAREER
BEHIND.

279
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,333
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
THEATER IS A BEAUTIFUL ART FORM,

280
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,083
ONE THAT IS WELL WORTH
DEDICATING ONE'S LIFE TO.

281
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,083
BUT NO MATTER HOW GOOD YOU ARE,

282
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,583
AT THE END OF THE DAY
IT'S JUST STILL MAKE-BELIEVE.

283
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,625
I WANTED SOMETHING
MORE THAN THAT, SO I QUIT.

284
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:49,958
FORTUNATELY, I DISCOVERED
THAT THE ARMS TRADE

285
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,250
IS FULL OF ACTORS.

286
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,416
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING
TO DECEIVE SOMEONE,

287
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,250
AND IF THEY SEE
THROUGH YOUR PRETENSE,

288
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,541
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE REAL.

289
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,541
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK IS HAPPENING HERE?

290
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,458
KOKO'S BEEN TRYING
HER HAND AT ACTING

291
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,541
DURING THOSE PHONE CALLS
YOU TAPPED.

292
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,958
THAT'S RIGHT. THE WOMAN IS--
- A LIAR!

293
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,958
- I THOUGHT YOU'D ACTUALLY
GIVEN UP. YOU HAD ME CONVINCED.

294
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:13,166
- I HOPE THEY ARE.
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

295
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,333
- Schokolade: JEEZ, MAKE ME
WADE THROUGH ALL THAT BULLSHIT

296
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:17,541
BEFORE YOU FINALLY SEND ME
A LEGIT EMAIL?

297
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,375
MAN, WHY IS IT I ALWAYS
SEEM TO END UP

298
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,791
WORKIN' FOR SLAVE DRIVERS?

299
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:23,583
A SINGLE DIAMOND
IS NOT WORTH ALL THIS WORK.

300
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,083
- Amalia: UNFORTUNATELY,
WE STILL DON'T KNOW

301
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,958
WHO IS THAT WOMAN
MEETING WITH HER.

302
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,625
WHATEVER THE CASE, KOKO'S GOT
A MASSIVE ATTACK PLANNED.

303
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:34,083
WHAT SHE WANTS IS TO TEAR APART
MY WEB OF ALLIANCES.

304
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,708
THAT SEEMS TO BE
FIGHTING STYLE SHE PREFERS.

305
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:39,250
I WILL SEND
THE COUNTRY B EXECS A REMINDER.

306
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,125
WHATEVER HAPPENS NEXT,

307
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,916
I DO NOT WANT THEM
CHANGING THEIR MINDS.

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,583
- ( knocking )
- Lutz: BOSS LADY?

309
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,791
CAN I COME IN?
- OF COURSE, LUTZ.

310
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,250
- HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEWS?

311
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,375
COUNTRY A
HAS DROPPED THAT CAMPAIGN

312
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,208
THAT THE AMERICANS
WERE SO UPSET ABOUT.

313
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,458
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU WERE HOPING WOULD HAPPEN.

314
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,083
SEEMS MIGHTY TIMELY,
DOESN'T IT?

315
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,583
- I COULDN'T MANIPULATE
A MILITARY OP LIKE THAT

316
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,333
FROM A HOTEL ROOM.

317
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,208
MY IDEA WAS SIMPLY A COG
IN A MUCH GREATER MACHINE.

318
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,291
IT TAKES THOUSANDS
UPON THOUSANDS OF COGS

319
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,541
TO MAKE UP AN ARMY.

320
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,583
AND IT'S THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF THE PEOPLE

321
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,291
THAT ULTIMATELY
SET THOSE COGS IN MOTION.

322
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:18,458
THE WORLD IS SET ABLAZE
BY THE WILL OF ITS PEOPLE.

323
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,458
- Marquis: YOU'RE A
PERFECTIONIST, AREN'T YOU,

324
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,875
MS. TOROHOVSKY?

325
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,666
THE FIGHT IS ESSENTIALLY OVER.
AND YOU CAME OUT ON TOP.

326
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,583
SO WHAT NEED
COULD YOU POSSIBLY HAVE

327
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,083
TO WIN ME OVER AT THIS POINT?

328
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:32,041
- PARDON ME, LIEUTENANT COLONEL.
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

329
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,291
- HMM?

330
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,625
WHAT THE--
- IS SOMETHING AMISS?

331
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,375
- IT SEEMS THE GERMAN AIR FORCE
IS PURCHASING PREDATORS

332
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,791
FROM THE U.S.
A FULL 20 OF THEM!

333
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,583
AND THEY'RE ALL EQUIPPED
WITH GERMAN-MADE I.S.R. SYSTEMS.

334
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,458
IN LIGHT OF THIS,
THERE ARE SOME THINGS

335
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,291
I MUST DISCUSS WITH MS.
HEKMATYAR. THIS CANNOT WAIT.

336
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,791
SINCERE APOLOGIES,
BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE.

337
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,750
- THIS IS IT. HEKMATYAR'S
LAUNCHING HER ATTACK.

338
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,083
- ( yawns ) DONE AT LAST.
DAMN, MY SHOULDERS HURT.

339
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,625
HAULIN' ALL THOSE CONTRACTS
TO KOKO'S CONNECTIONS

340
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,875
WAS TOUGHER WORK
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

341
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,791
WHAT IS THAT I'M SMELLING?
GERMAN SAUSAGE.

342
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,708
AND SCHWARZBIER TOO!
YAY.

343
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:12,750
- RIGHT. GATHER EURO GROUP'S
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

344
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,833
- AMALIA, SPAIN HAS JUST
MADE A PREDATOR PURCHASE.

345
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,833
- SPAIN, AS WELL?
IS THAT NASSOS OF THE E.A.E.?

346
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,541
- I'M IN DEEP SHIT! IT'S THAT
HEKMATYAR WOMAN'S DOING.

347
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,333
I MUST RETURN
TO MY COUNTRY AT ONCE.

348
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,166
- DIRECTOR, WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT'S A T.O.B.

349
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,541
SOMEONE'S BUYING UP
MY COMPANY'S STOCK.

350
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:33,333
SOME NEW BANK INVESTOR
CALLED EURO HEKMA-I.B.

351
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,833
WHAT THAT WOMAN IS DOING
IS BARELY LEGAL.

352
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,458
- IT'S NOT JUST MY WEB.

353
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,708
SHE'S TRYING
TO TEAR ME DOWN TOO.

354
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:43,458
SO THIS IS THE FULL MIGHT
OF KOKO HEKMATYAR.

355
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,666
- ( ringing )

356
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,208
- I THOUGHT YOU AND I
COULD MEET FOR A CHAT.

357
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,625
HOW ABOUT NOW, PLEASE?

358
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:54,583
- Koko: SURE THING.

359
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,500
- I'M SO SORRY FOR DISRUPTING
YOUR EVENING, KOKO.

360
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,375
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MEET ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

361
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
- PLEASE, AMALIA,
THINK NOTHING OF IT.

362
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,583
AND FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING,
BUT ARE YOU ARMED?

363
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,583
SHOULD I BE WORRIED
ABOUT SNIPERS?

364
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,583
- NO SNIPERS.
THIS GENTLEMAN HAS A GUN.

365
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:18,875
POOR MAN HAS DOUBLE DUTY AS MY
CONSULTANT AND MY BODYGUARD.

366
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,916
REALLY, YOU CAN RELAX.

367
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,166
I DIDN'T COME HERE WITH THE
INTENTION OF DOING YOU HARM.

368
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,791
- SHOULD ANYONE SHOW UP
WHO WE DEEM TO BE SUSPICIOUS,

369
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,833
WE WILL TAKE
APPROPRIATE COUNTER MEASURES.

370
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,125
AS SUCH, NO, I CAN'T RELAX.

371
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,791
- KOKO, WITH AN
ATTITUDE LIKE THAT,

372
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,041
YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF AN ULCER.

373
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,083
- TWO SNIPERS.
BITCH IS FULL OF IT.

374
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,416
- NOT NECESSARILY. SHE REALLY
MIGHT NOT KNOW THEY'RE THERE.

375
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,541
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE
IF YOU KEEP IN MIND

376
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,625
THE INFORMATION
LEHM PASSED ALONG.

377
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,500
COUNTRY B'S MAN
HIRED SOME ASSASSINS

378
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,791
AFTER HE LEFT ENGLAND.

379
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,750
GUESS HE WASN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT WHAT KOKO DID.

380
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:55,166
JUST LIKE HER TO PISS OFF
SOMEONE WITH A SHORT FUSE.

381
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,583
- SOME PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE
DISAPPOINTMENT. CAN THEY?

382
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:01,333
MAN, THESE ANTI-INFRARED SUITS
GET WARM.

383
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,458
IDIOTS ARE WIDE OPEN.

384
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,833
AND THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN THEIR
FINGERS OFF THE TRIGGERS

385
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,333
FOR ONE SECOND.

386
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:10,166
- OH, SUCK IT UP. IT'S NOT
LIKE WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR DAYS.

387
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,833
- I MUST SAY I REGRET NOT
PAYING CLOSER ATTENTION

388
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,375
WHEN WE FIRST MET.
I MIGHT HAVE NOTICED THAT

389
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,333
SWEET LITTLE FACE
OF YOURS IS JUST A MASK.

390
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,750
- YES, IT IS.

391
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,583
I TAKE IT YOU FINALLY
MANAGED TO SEE THROUGH

392
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,291
ALL MY DIVERSIONS.
I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS

393
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,541
OF A FORMER ACTRESS
SUCH AS YOURSELF.

394
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,583
BUT THAT'S THE EXTENT
OF YOUR STRENGTH.

395
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,583
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU,
I KNEW IMMEDIATELY

396
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,666
THAT YOU'D NEVER SET FOOT
ON A BATTLEFIELD.

397
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,916
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT AN ARMS DEALER

398
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,083
HAS TO SPEND ALL HER TIME
IN WAR ZONES.

399
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,375
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU'RE SELLING.

400
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,791
WEAPONS GO TO SOLDIERS, WHO USE
THEM TO KILL OTHER SOLDIERS.

401
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,666
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE,

402
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,916
YOU CAN'T HOPE
TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

403
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,250
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
THE TRUE SUBSTANCE

404
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,708
OF YOUR OWN MERCHANDISE.

405
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,541
- YOU SPEAK AS IF
I AM TOTALLY IGNORANT.

406
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,166
I DO KNOW MY COMPANY
SELLS DANGEROUS THINGS.

407
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,833
- "THE BOSS SHOULD ALWAYS
BE SMILING, NO MATTER WHAT."

408
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,833
ONE OF MY OLD BODYGUARDS
SAID THAT.

409
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,416
"COVER YOUR FACE WITH A MASK

410
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,041
AND WRAP YOUR HEART
IN IRON ARMOR".

411
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,458
THOSE ARE WORDS
MY FATHER LIVES BY.

412
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:10,250
I REMEMBER THEIR ADVICE BECAUSE
THEY COULDN'T BE MORE RIGHT.

413
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,583
BEING IN THE BUSINESS
OF SELLING DANGEROUS THINGS,

414
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,000
AS YOU CALL THEM,
TENDS TO ROT THE SOUL,

415
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,875
MUCH IN THE SAME WAY
A COTTON SHIRT WILL ROT

416
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,791
RIGHT OFF YOUR BODY
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE JUNGLE.

417
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,791
- I SUPPOSE TWO ARMS DEALERS

418
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,000
CANNOT HOPE TO MEET
WITHOUT CONFLICT.

419
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,791
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT SOMEONE
SO NAIVE SHE ONLY BROUGHT

420
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,125
ONE BODYGUARD SHOULD GET OUT
BEFORE SHE GETS BURNED?

421
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,083
- Koko:
NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

422
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,125
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO SHARE ONE MORE THING.

423
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,041
- I LOVE IT!
I AM HAVING SO MUCH FUN.

424
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,333
DON'T THINK ME CRAZY, BUT I'VE
BEEN TINGLING WITH EXCITEMENT

425
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,041
SINCE I SAW THE HEAD
OF THE E.A.E.

426
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,000
RUN BACK TO HIS HOME COUNTRY.

427
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,083
HE WAS SO ANGRY,
I WAS CONVINCED

428
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,666
HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A STROKE
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

429
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,875
I DON'T DO WHAT I DO BECAUSE
I'M FIGHTING FOR SOME CAUSE

430
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,291
OR BECAUSE I HAVE
A FAMILY TO SUPPORT.

431
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,791
NO, I DO IT
BECAUSE I LIKE THE RUSH.

432
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,916
IT'S LESS AND LESS
OFTEN THESE DAYS

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,208
THAT YOU COME ACROSS
SOMEONE WHO CAN THROW

434
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:02,833
A REALLY STRONG PUNCH,
LET ALONE ANOTHER WOMAN.

435
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,375
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME,
HONESTLY.

436
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,875
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
I LIVE FOR--

437
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,041
FUN CHATS LIKE THIS.

438
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,583
ALL YOUR WORK HAS PAID OFF,
KOKO.

439
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,125
WE ARE PULLING OUT
OF THE U.A.V. SALES CAMPAIGN.

440
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:18,041
THE EURO GROUP CONCEDES DEFEAT
TO YOU THIS TIME AROUND.

441
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,208
- ( laughs )
IT WAS A TOUGH BATTLE.

442
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,916
- "YESTERDAY'S ENEMY,
TOMORROW'S FRIEND."

443
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
THAT IS THE EUROPEAN WAY
OF THINKING.

444
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,791
- ( thinking ) OH JEEZ.
- YOU AGREE WITH ME, DON'T YOU?

445
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,500
ENEMIES TODAY
CAN BECOME FRIENDS TOMORROW.

446
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,583
- NO NEED TO REPEAT IT.
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.

447
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,375
NOW, WHY DID YOU
WANT TO MEET ME?

448
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,791
- ABOUT E.A.E.'S STOCK.

449
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,333
CAN YOU PLEASE DO SOMETHING?
AS A FRIEND?

450
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,833
- WHAT A SURPRISE.

451
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,125
COME NOW, SURELY YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS WORKS.

452
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,708
LET'S REFER BACK TO THAT
DISCUSSION WE HAD A MINUTE AGO.

453
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:51,250
I AM WELL AWARE
OF HOW EUROPEANS DO THINGS.

454
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,666
BUT I THINK IT
MAY BE TIME FOR YOU

455
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,625
TO RECONSIDER YOUR METHODS.

456
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,500
WE NEED TO DON OUR MASKS

457
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,416
AND STRIKE OUT AT OUR
MUTUAL ENEMIES. THAT'S RIGHT.

458
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,166
THE RECENTLY PRIVATIZED
NATIONAL DEFENSE COMPANIES.

459
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,625
AS WE CAN SEE FROM THE SITUATION
WE JUST FOUND OURSELVES IN,

460
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,875
THEY WILL ONLY SERVE
TO HOLD THE WHOLE GROUP BACK.

461
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,833
THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES
AS UNSINKABLE WARSHIPS,

462
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:15,791
AND THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE
DOESN'T VANISH OVERNIGHT.

463
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:18,208
INVERSELY, THAT WILL--
- Amalia: WOULD YOU CONSIDER

464
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:22,291
SELLING IT BACK AT 2.5%
OF YOUR T.O.B. PURCHASE PRICE?

465
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,208
- WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

466
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,833
THE BEST I CAN OFFER IS 10%.
- 5%.

467
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:30,166
- ( thinking ) THIS IS INSANE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THESE WOMEN.

468
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,541
THEY'RE CASUALLY DECIDING
THE FATE OF THE ENTIRE E.A.E.

469
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,750
IN SOME FILTHY BACK ALLEY.

470
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,625
( aloud )
SNIPER ONE, SNIPER TWO,

471
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,958
TAKE POSITION AND PREPARE
TO FIRE. DO YOU COPY?

472
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:39,958
- ROGER.
- ROGER.

473
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,708
- KOKO.
- YOU ARE CLEAR TO FIRE.

474
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,500
EXCELLENT SHOOTING, LUTZ.

475
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,791
- ( Wilee laughs ) THEY DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT HIT 'EM.

476
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,583
BADASS.
YOU REALLY ARE GOOD, LUTZ.

477
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,333
- THE 270 METERS
ACROSS THE RIVER ISN'T THAT FAR.

478
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,958
EVEN LEHM
COULD HAVE GOTTEN IT DONE.

479
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,458
- SORRY TO STARTLE YOU.

480
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,500
WE HAD SOME TROUBLEMAKERS
TO DEAL WITH.

481
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,791
BUT WE DIDN'T KILL THEM.

482
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,375
I AM WILLING TO SELL, BUT ONLY
IF IT'S DIRECTLY TO YOU.

483
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
HOW DOES 5% SOUND?

484
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,500
- THAT SOUNDS MORE THAN FAIR,
KOKO.

485
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,458
- I THOUGHT IT MIGHT.
SEE YOU AT THE EMBASSY TOMORROW.

486
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,583
- Valmet: I DON'T GET IT.

487
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,000
WHY WERE YOU SO SOFT
ON THAT WOMAN?  UGH!

488
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,000
- YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW.

489
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,458
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE SHE SAID
IT WAS FUN TALKING TO ME.

490
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,208
- THEN I MUST BE HAVING
A MILLION TIMES MORE FUN

491
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,833
