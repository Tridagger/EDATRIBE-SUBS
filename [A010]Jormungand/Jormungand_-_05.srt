1
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,750
- BAD ASS!
IT'S DEAD ACCURATE.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,416
- LUTZ, GIVE ME A GO.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
- CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LIGHT IT IS.
I'VE NEVER SHOT AN XM8 BEFORE--

4
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,833
- Jonah: I STILL HATE WEAPONS
AS MUCH AS I EVER DID.

5
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,708
- Koko: JONAH.

6
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:30,500
- BUT WHEN I'M WITH KOKO,

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,208
IT'S LIKE SHE'S GOT
THIS WEIRD POWER

8
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,416
TO MAKE ME FORGET THAT HATRED
FOR A WHILE.

9
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,916
HERE I AM,
TRAVELING WITH AN ARMS DEALER.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,875
- ( theme music playing )

11
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,041
- WHAT'S WITH THE HAT?
YOU DOING SOME GARDENING?

13
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,458
- ( laughs )
GARDENING, ON A SHIP?

14
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,000
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY
ATTEMPT TO GROW OUT HERE?

15
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,000
I'M SIMPLY DOING
WHAT I CAN TO PROTECT

16
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,708
MY DELICATE COMPLEXION
FROM THIS SUN.

17
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:24,291
- KOKO,
THE CAPTAIN'S ON THE HORN.

18
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,000
- SHIT, ONE-HANDED?  IMPRESSIVE.
- A FREIGHTER?

19
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,833
IT'S THE ONE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THIS MORNING.

20
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:31,458
SOMEONE FROM H.Q. IS COMING
TO MAKE A CARGO TRANSFER.

21
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,625
- ( phone ringing )
- WHO'S THAT?

22
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,000
KOKO HERE!

23
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,666
( gasps ) YEAH.

24
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,250
MMM, AGES.

25
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,500
UH, YOU'RE ON BOARD?
GOT IT.

26
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:46,208
SEE YA SOON.  CIAO.

27
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,166
- ( phone beeps off )
- SOMETHING THE MATTER?

28
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,791
- FUCK MY LIFE!

29
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,916
MY BIG BROTHER
IS ONBOARD THAT FREIGHTER.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,458
WILEE, WE NEED TO HIDE JONAH.

31
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,750
TAKE HIM BELOW DECKS FOR A
GRAMMAR LESSON OR SOMETHING.

32
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:06,125
- ROGER THAT.

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,791
- WHAT'S KOKO
FREAKED OUT ABOUT NOW?

34
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,791
- NOT SURE.  GUESS SOMETHING
UNEXPECTED HAS COME UP.

35
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,250
IT CAN'T BE TOO BIG A DEAL,
THOUGH.

36
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:22,208
SHE'S NOT HAVING US GEAR UP.
( laughs )

37
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,791
COME ON,
LET'S GET THIS LESSON STARTED.

38
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,250
- Valmet:
IF I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS OLDER,

39
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,000
I'D THINK YOU TWO WERE TWINS.

40
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,166
EXCEPT, YOU'RE THE HOTTER ONE,
OF COURSE.

41
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,833
- HEY, KOKO.

42
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,708
- HELLO, KASPER.

43
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,750
- V.L. MICA MISSILES.

44
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:48,166
WILL THEY SELL?
- HEY.

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,625
- THEY ALREADY HAVE.
I JUST NEED TO DELIVER 'EM.

46
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,916
BUT LET'S CUT THE CRAP.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE IN AFRICA?

48
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,875
- SAME AS YOU.
I HEAR A SPOOK CAUGHT UP TO YOU.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,583
YOU KNOW WHY
THEY CALL HIM SCARECROW, RIGHT?

50
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,583
IT'S ALL ABOUT
WHAT'S NOT BETWEEN HIS EARS.

51
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:05,500
BIT OF A JOKE, ISN'T HE?

52
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,833
GOOD AT RAISING
UNTRACEABLE FUNDS, THOUGH.

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,583
IT'S THE ONLY REASON THE U.S.
STILL PUTS UP WITH HIS CRAP.

54
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,583
BUT BE CAREFUL.
HE'S PERSISTENT,

55
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,416
BRAIN IN HIS HEAD OR NOT.
- YEAH, LIKE I GIVE A DAMN.

56
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,375
"AN ARMS DEALER IS ABLE
TO SEE CONTRADICTIONS

57
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:21,083
THAT OTHERS MISS."

58
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,833
INTERESTING.
SOUNDS LIKE KOKO, ALL RIGHT.

59
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,666
CONTRADICTION--

60
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,958
AN OPPOSITION BETWEEN THINGS
COMPARED, AN INCONSISTENCY.

61
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:34,000
NOW WRITE THE WORD
"CONTRADICTION" THREE TIMES.

62
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:37,041
YOU KNOW, CHINA HAS A RICH
TRADITION OF FOLKLORE.

63
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,250
THEY USE SIMPLE
TALES TO ILLUSTRATE

64
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,958
THE MEANING OF COMPLEX IDEAS.

65
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,958
TAKE, "THE PIKE AND SHIELD."

66
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,500
IT'S A STORY
ABOUT A WEAPONS DEALER.

67
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,791
ONCE UPON A TIME,
A WEAPONS MAKER

68
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,041
GATHERED A CROWD
TO SHOW OFF HIS NEW PIKE.

69
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,791
HE BOASTED THAT IT COULD
PIERCE THROUGH ANYTHING.

70
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,708
NEXT, HE BROUGHT OUT
A SHIELD HE HAD CRAFTED.

71
00:04:55,791 --> 00:05:00,166
HE CLAIMED THAT THE SHIELD
COULD DEFLECT ANY ATTACK.

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,291
THEN ONE OF THE ONLOOKERS
ASKED FOR A DEMONSTRATION.

73
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,875
HE SAID, "WHAT IF THE PIKE
IS USED AGAINST THE SHIELD?"

74
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,708
BUT THE CRAFTSMAN
HAD NO ANSWER.

75
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:11,125
THE END.
GOOD STORY, HUH?

76
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,583
- IF YOU SAY SO.
I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD BETTER.

77
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:15,916
- IN DUBAI?
THE CHINESE SEEM TO BE

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,250
EXPANDING THEIR OPERATIONS
EVERYWHERE, HUH?

79
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,250
WHO'S THIS DEALER ALLIED WITH?

80
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,958
- UNFORTUNATELY,
WE'RE NOT CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

81
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,208
ONE THING WE DO KNOW FOR SURE,
THOUGH,

82
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,625
IS THAT HE'S
NOT A VERY NICE GUY AT ALL.

83
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,416
- I DIDN'T RUN INTO HIM
WHILE I WAS THERE.

84
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,916
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY WILL
WHILE YOU'RE IN AFRICA.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,750
SO KEEP A SHARP EYE OUT.

86
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,250
HE RUNS THE DA XINGHAI
TRADING COMPANY.

87
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,375
WELL, ON PAPER ANYWAY.

88
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,250
- HMM.  IF YOU'RE WARNING ME
TO WATCH MY BACK,

89
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,916
HE MUST BE
ONE SERIOUS PIECE OF WORK.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,666
- ( laughs )

91
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,583
YEAH,
SO I SHOULD HEAD OUT.

92
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,916
AH, DO YOU MIND IF I USE
THE RESTROOM BEFORE I GO?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,458
- WHAT AM I, YOUR BOSS?

94
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,666
YOU DON'T NEED MY PERMISSION
TO TAKE A PISS.

95
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,125
- YOU'RE A PRETTY DECENT STUDENT
WHEN IT COMES TO LANGUAGES.

96
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,250
BUT TOJO SAYS YOU'RE QUICK
TO SKIP OUT

97
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,125
WHEN IT'S TIME
FOR YOUR MATH LESSONS.

98
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:13,166
- I'M NOT ANY GOOD AT NUMBERS.
- ( laughs )

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,958
I HEAR YA. THEY'RE NOT
MY SPECIALTY, EITHER.

100
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,500
IF YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME,

101
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,333
YOU'LL PREFER READING
BOOKS TO DOING MATH.

102
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,333
YOU KNOW WHAT I
LIKE ABOUT BOOKS?

103
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:24,333
THEY DON'T HAVE
JUST ONE INTERPRETATION.

104
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,458
DEPENDING ON WHO'S READING TH--
- GOTTA PEE.

105
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,500
- ARE YOU DITCHIN'?
- NO, I REALLY HAVE TO PEE.

106
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,291
- Kasper: BLACK GUY!
LONG TIME.

107
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,833
- KASPER!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.

108
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
IT'S BEEN AGES.

109
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,375
( thinking ) DAMN IT.
THIS IS WHAT SHE MEANT.

110
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,750
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN TELL HIM
HE CAN'T GO IN THERE.

111
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,666
- HMM.
( unzips pants )

112
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,166
- ( toilet flushes )

113
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,500
- KASPER!

114
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:16,291
- HELLO TO YOU, TOO, JONAH.
YOU LOOK WELL.

115
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,875
- LET ME GO, CHEQUITA!
- IT TRULY SADDENS ME

116
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,125
TO SEE A BOY AS YOUNG AS YOU
WIELDING A KNIFE.

117
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,333
EVEN MORE DEPRESSING
IS THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYE

118
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,166
TELLS ME YOU HAD EVERY INTENTION
OF USING IT.

119
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,166
I WILL ONLY TELL YOU ONCE.
DROP THE KNIFE.

120
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,791
YOU COULDN'T KILL ANYONE
WITH THIS TOY.

121
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:37,541
ALL YOU'D ACCOMPLISH IS LOSING
A FEW OF YOUR OWN FINGERS.

122
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,666
TRY USING SOMETHING WITH
A LONG HANDLE AND FULL TANG.

123
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,958
VALMET CAN EXPLAIN
THE DETAILS TO YOU.

124
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:48,666
- ( laughs )
MAKE UP YOUR MIND.

125
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,416
ARE YOU LECTURING HIM

126
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,458
OR GIVING HIM
PROFESSIONAL ADVICE?

127
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,250
ANYHOW, THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY
OF SAYING "HELLO."

128
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,708
IF JONAH REALLY WANTED
TO ATTACK ME,

129
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,250
I'M SURE
HE WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED.

130
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,083
HE'S A SOLDIER, AFTER ALL,

131
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,041
EVEN MORE LETHAL NOW
THAN WHEN WE MET.

132
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,791
- DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD KIDS HERE,
COMMANDER.

133
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:16,166
- THAT ONE'S A SOLDIER.
WE REQUESTED MORE MEN FROM H.Q.

134
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,333
AND THEY SENT OVER
SOME BRAT FROM THE ALPINE UNIT.

135
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:21,083
THE OTHER KIDS HERE ARE ORPHANS,
THOUGH.

136
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,791
IN ANY CASE, I ACCEPT
YOUR PROPOSAL, GASUD.

137
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:27,833
FROM WHAT I HEAR, AN UPCOMING
SHIFT IN NATIONAL POLICY

138
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:31,208
IS LIKELY TO STEM OUR CURRENT
FLOW OF WEAPON SUPPLIES.

139
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,625
IF THAT HAPPENS, I DON'T SEE
THAT WE HAVE ANY CHOICE

140
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,250
BUT TO TURN TO THE WEST
FOR THE ARMS WE NEED.

141
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,708
- MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY.

142
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:40,708
- HOWEVER-- AND I WANT
TO MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR--

143
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,041
THE ONLY REASON
I'M MOVING FORWARD ON THIS

144
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,125
IS BECAUSE OF HOW LONG
YOU'VE WORKED UNDER

145
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,875
THE ILLUSTRIOUS KASPER.

146
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,750
ARRANGE A MEETING
WITH HIM FOR ME.

147
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,375
- THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

148
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,250
KASPER HAS HAD A KEEN INTEREST
IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME.

149
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,500
WELL, SHALL WE?
I'M AFRAID THAT MY "BAGGAGE"

150
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,583
IS STUCK
IN AN UNFORTUNATE LOCATION.

151
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,875
- I UNDERSTAND.

152
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,541
- Jonah:
THIS YASUF GASUD GUY--

153
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:09,208
WHO IS HE, REALLY?
I DON'T BUY HIM AS A JOURNALIST.

154
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,416
THE VICE COMMANDER'S COMING!
MALKA, HIDE THE FOOD!

155
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,291
- LET'S SEE IF YOU BRATS
ARE GOOD FOR ANYTHING

156
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,208
BUT EATIN' MY FOOD.

157
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,666
YOU AND YOU--
COME WITH ME.

158
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,500
GO.
- Both: SIR!

159
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:29,541
- ( children crying )

160
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,708
- HE HAS EVIL IN HIS EYES.

161
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,375
HOLD ON!
I'LL COME TOO.

162
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,375
- SILENCE!
YOU'LL DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

163
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:41,291
DO NOT QUESTION ME, EVER!
- SHOULDN'T WE BE GOING?

164
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,333
- DAMN KID CAN'T FOLLOW
A SIMPLE ORDER.

165
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,333
- JONATHAN!

166
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,791
- Jonah: THAT WAS IT.

167
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,791
MY FINAL GLIMPSE OF MALKA.

168
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,583
I NEVER SAW HER AGAIN.

169
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,041
- ( crying )
MALKA, MALKA.

170
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,708
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH YOU.

171
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,458
I SHOULD HAVE FOUGHT HARDER.

172
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,583
I KNOW WHAT THEY DID.
I KNOW.

173
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,500
THEY MADE YOU
WALK THROUGH AN OLD MINEFIELD.

174
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,375
MALKA, MALKA.

175
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:26,208
DAMN IT, YOU DESERVED BETTER!

176
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,333
MAURICE,
LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.

177
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:36,750
I NEED YOU TO TAKE ALL THE
CHILDREN TO OUR SECRET BASE.

178
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,416
DON'T LEAVE, NO MATTER WHAT.

179
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,208
- AH!

180
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,666
HEY, YOU!

181
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,041
- ( machine gunfire )

182
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,041
- Jonah: NO MATTER WHAT.

183
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,166
- Man: WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

184
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,416
- I'M NOT SURE! UNKNOWN ENEMY.
- HURRY!

185
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,833
- HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON
OUT THERE?

186
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,458
- ( gunshots )

187
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,083
- WHERE'S THE SHOOTER?!

188
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,750
- HOLD FIRE!
YOU'RE SHOOTING BLIND.

189
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,416
YOU'LL HIT EACH OTHER!

190
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,583
- IT SOUNDS LIKE
THE FIGHTING'S GETTING CLOSER.

191
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,333
- KEEP QUIET.

192
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,791
- WHO THE HELL IS OUT THERE?

193
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,000
WHY CAN'T ANYONE GET A VISUAL
ON THE ENEMY SHOOTERS?

194
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,375
- KEEP IT DOWN!
- ( gunfire )

195
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,375
- ( shell clanging )

196
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,208
- HEY!  I GOT ONE.

197
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,166
- I WILL AVENGE YOU, MALKA.

198
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,291
- SOMEONE GIVE ME
A STATUS REPORT.

199
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,250
MEN, DO YOU COPY?
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

200
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:40,208
- ( gunfire )

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,750
- HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED THE ENEMY?
YOU FAT-- 

202
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,291
- ( gun cocks )

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,791
- Jonah: YOU'RE NO JOURNALIST.
WHO ARE YOU?

204
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:56,333
- I'M-- 
I'M AN ARMS DEALER.

205
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,666
EASY THERE.

206
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,666
YOU CAN SPARE ONE LIFE,
CAN'T YOU?

207
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,541
IF YOU DO-- I KNOW--
YOU CAN HAVE THIS.

208
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,708
ALL OF IT!

209
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,791
- I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
GIVE ME MALKA.

210
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,583
- UH, MALKA?
WHAT'S A MALKA?

211
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,333
- ( fires )

212
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,750
- MAURICE,
LOOK AFTER THE KIDS.

213
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,791
- ( cocks gun )
- SOMETHING'S THERE.

214
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:32,375
SHARP AND VIOLENT.
WOLVES?

215
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,583
NO, NOT ANIMALS.
PEOPLE.

216
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,458
MEN FROM THE BASE?

217
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,833
NO, DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THEM.
BUT I'M SURROUNDED.

218
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,375
( coughing )

219
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,458
- Chequita ( filtered ):
HELLO THERE, LITTLE SOLDIER BOY.

220
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,166
CLEAR!

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,791
NOT BAD.
YOU'VE GOT GOOD INSTINCTS.

222
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:05,875
JUST LIKE A MISHKA--
A LITTLE BEAR CUB.

223
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,000
- Man: FROM A QUICK SURVEY
OF THE SCENE,

224
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,041
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS KID
ATTACKED THE ENTIRE UNIT

225
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,208
JUST TO KILL GASUD.

226
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,000
RENDERED THE WHOLE
DAMN BASE INOPERABLE.

227
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,833
- Chequita: IMPRESSIVE.

228
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:27,083
- MY NAME IS KASPER HEKMATYAR.
I'M AN ARMS DEALER.

229
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,625
WHO ARE YOU?

230
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,208
I DON'T SEE YOU
IN THESE RECORDS.

231
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:35,375
YOU AREN'T LISTED AMONG THE
SOLDIERS OR THE FOUR ORPHANS.

232
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,708
- IT'S NOT HARD, MISHKA.
HE'S JUST ASKING YOUR NAME.

233
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,458
GO ON.
- THREE.

234
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,000
THERE ARE
ONLY THREE ORPHANS NOW.

235
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,041
THAT BASTARD GASUD
KILLED MALKA.

236
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:50,083
- I SEE.
SO THAT'S WHAT STARTED ALL THIS.

237
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:54,208
WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL?
SATISFIED?

238
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,916
YOU GOT REVENGE
FOR YOUR FRIEND.

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,583
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS KILL EVERYONE ON THE BASE.

240
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:03,458
I GET IT-- YOU COULDN'T
LET ANYONE STOP YOU

241
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,625
BEFORE YOU REACHED YOUR TARGET,
SO YOU MADE A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE.

242
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:09,875
'CAUSE WHAT GOOD
CAN YOU DO IF YOU'RE DEAD?

243
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,375
LITTLE BACK STORY
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN--

244
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,083
BOTH MY YOUNGER SISTER AND I
WERE BORN ON A CONTAINER SHIP

245
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,583
OUT AT SEA, SPENT OUR
CHILDHOODS BOUNCING

246
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,208
FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY.

247
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,625
I HAVE FAKE PASSPORTS FROM
EVERY NATION UNDER THE SUN.

248
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,333
BUT WITH NO REAL HOMELAND,
I HAVE NO CONCEPT OF PATRIOTISM.

249
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,458
THAT'S THE SCARY THING.

250
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,083
EVEN I FIND YOUR ACTIONS TODAY
A LITTLE ABHORRENT.

251
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:36,208
ALL THAT DEATH FOR ONE
TINY GIRL. PRETTY SICK.

252
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,708
EVEN SO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED

253
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,000
THAT YOU DO DIFFERENTLY.

254
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,750
NO SURPRISE THERE.

255
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,291
EVERY BATTLEFIELD'S
FULL OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

256
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,916
ANYWAY, WORKED OUT FOR ME.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,500
HMM.

258
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:54,541
IT'S JUST ONE LESS SUBORDINATE
WHO CAN'T DO HIS JOB PROPERLY.

259
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,916
I WASN'T ACTUALLY TRYING TO
SELL THEM WEAPONS, YOU KNOW.

260
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,291
I WAS SEDUCING THEM,
LULLING THEM INTO COMPLACENCY.

261
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,833
LOOK, THERE ARE PLANS
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION

262
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,541
OF A MILITARY ROAD
THAT WILL SPAN THE NATION.

263
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,541
THIS BASE WAS SIMPLY IN
THE WAY OF THOSE PLANS.

264
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,958
ONCE IT'S FINISHED,
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF OIL,

265
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,500
WEAPONS, AND SOLDIERS
WILL FLOW DOWN THAT ROAD.

266
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,916
AS A RESULT,
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WILL PROSPER.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,750
- A ROAD?

268
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,458
MALKA DIED
SO THEY COULD BUILD A ROAD?

269
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,833
- ( thinking )
NAMELESS CHILD SOLDIER,

270
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,041
I KNOW THAT ANGER
HAS MADE YOU STRONG.

271
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:31,000
I ALSO KNOW IT'S NOT IN YOUR
NATURE TO ENJOY VIOLENCE.

272
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,000
BUT WHAT ABOUT FEAR?

273
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,208
( aloud ) YOU HAVE TO ANSWER
FOR KILLING MY EMPLOYEE.

274
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,416
I'M CURIOUS, HOW WILL YOU ACT
WHEN THE ENEMY YOU FACE IS FEAR?

275
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,875
- WAIT, HOLD ON!
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL THEM?

276
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,375
THE OTHER CHILDREN?
KASPER!

277
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,500
AH!

278
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,541
KASPER!

279
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,458
THERE WAS NOTHING
IN THE CONTAINER BUT WATER.

280
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:02,250
BEFORE LONG,
I WAS TOO HUNGRY TO MOVE.

281
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,125
I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT MALKA,

282
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,541
ABOUT WHAT KASPER HAD SAID,

283
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,458
AND WHAT I HAD DONE.

284
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:12,416
ALONE IN A BOX
FOR WHO KNEW HOW LONG.

285
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,083
I WAS AFRAID IF I DIDN'T KEEP
MY MIND WORKING, I'D GO CRAZY.

286
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,666
- Koko: YOU'RE STILL HERE?

287
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,291
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

288
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:22,125
TWO GROWN ADULTS
PICKING ON JONAH?  PATHETIC!

289
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,875
LEAVE, KASPER.
OFF MY SHIP NOW!

290
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,208
- QUIT SHOVING!
- COME ON, MOVE YOUR ASS!

291
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,500
- MY MY,
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE, OLD MAN?

292
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,958
YOU SHOULD RETIRE.
- CHEQUITA.

293
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,291
THRILLING TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE AS POLITE AS EVER.

294
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,958
- GO EASY ON HIS ANCIENT ASS,
MISHKA.

295
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,291
- HEY, STOP KICKING.
YOU'RE GONNA PUSH ME OVERBOARD.

296
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,416
- KASPER, I SWEAR,

297
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,875
SOME DAY I WILL GET YOU BACK.

298
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,791
- RIGHT, JONAH.
SEE YA.

299
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,250
- YOU KNOW HE LOCKED ME
INSIDE A SHIPPING CONTAINER

300
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,125
FOR DAYS WITHOUT ANY FOOD.

301
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,875
- Koko: I KNOW.
I'M REALLY SORRY.

302
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,166
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT.

303
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,708
- Jonah: WHAT I DID AT THAT BASE
WAS TERRIBLE.

304
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:06,333
I'M BETTER AT TAKING LIVES
THAN SAVING THEM.

305
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,041
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

306
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,625
AS I WAS STARVING TO DEATH,
I KEPT ASKING MYSELF,

307
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,541
"DOES THE WORLD REALLY HATE ME
THIS MUCH?"

308
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:18,916
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER.

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,208
THE WORLD MAY HATE ME,
BUT I STILL LOVE IT.

310
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,166
DO YOU?

311
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,458
- I DON'T THINK
I CAN ANSWER THAT.

312
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,333
SO SORRY.

313
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,000
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

314
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,916
YOU PRETTY MUCH JUST DID.

315
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,208
I HATE THAT I HAVE TO
TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOU.

316
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,666
UNFORTUNATELY,
IF YOU RUST, I DIE.

317
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,250
- JONAH? UH...

318
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,291
THAT'S STRANGE.
WHERE'D HE GO?

319
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,500
IT'S TIME
FOR HIS SCIENCE LESSON.

320
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,916
- JONAH, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE BOSS LADY AROUND?

321
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,750
I HEAR
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING FOR ME.

322
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,875
ALL RIGHT.  WELL,
MAYBE SHE'S UP FRONT SOMEWHERE.

323
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,958
OH, YEAH, MAO WANTED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'D RUN OFF TO.

324
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,833
- SO?

325
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,125
- THAT'S IT?

326
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,833
- Tojo: YOU STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND JONAH?

327
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,125
( laughs )

328
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,875
YOU DO REALIZE HE'S HIDING
FROM YOU, DON'T YOU?

329
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,083
JUST LIKE HE DOES TO ME
WHEN IT'S TIME FOR MATH LESSONS.

330
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,500
- TOJO'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
- OF COURSE I AM.

331
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,750
THE KID'S TERRIBLE
AT THE SCIENCES.

332
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,083
HE'S A PRO WHEN IT COMES
TO PLAYING HOOKY, THOUGH.

333
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,708
IF HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT HIDING,
YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE.

334
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,666
- NICE.  WHAT IS IT?

335
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,583
- IT'S A VOLKS-
SOMETHING-OR-OTHER.

336
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,083
UM, OUR NEW CAR!

337
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,458
ORCHESTRA TRASHED
THE UNIT'S OLD RIDE,

338
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,291
SO I THOUGHT
I SHOULD GET US A NEW ONE.

339
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,375
YOUR QUICK THINKING
BEHIND THE WHEEL

340
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:56,041
REALLY HELPED US BACK THERE.

341
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,041
SERIOUSLY,
YOU'VE GOT SOME MAJOR SKILLS.

342
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,791
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, BUDDY.
- IT'S AMAZING.

343
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,625
THANK YOU.
BEST BOSS EVER.

344
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,583
- OH, HAVE YOU SEEN JONAH?

345
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,166
- OH, YEAH, I PASSED
BY HIM JUST A MINUTE AGO.

346
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,500
- Lehm:
WE'LL BE IN AFRICA A WHILE.

347
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,041
- YEAH, SO, WHAT OF IT?

348
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,916
YOU GOT SOMETHING YOU WANT
TO SAY TO ME? SPEAK UP.

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,083
- NOT REALLY.
I CAN'T SMOKE INSIDE,

350
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,875
SO I THOUGHT I'D ENJOY
THE VIEW ABOVE DECKS.

351
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,625
YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE HERE.

352
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,625
THERE'S NO REASON
TO GET SO EDGY.

353
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,333
YOU WENT THROUGH A HELL
OF A LOT IN THIS PLACE.

354
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,583
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'LL HAVE YOUR BACK.

355
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:34,166
AND I'M SURE KOKO
FEELS THE SAME WAY.

356
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,083
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

357
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:38,041
MY SCAR WAS JUST ACHING
A LITTLE BIT

358
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,416
WHEN WE DROPPED ANCHOR EARLIER.
THAT'S ALL.

359
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,250
GRANTED, I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHAT HAPPENED

360
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,166
WHILE I WAS STATIONED HERE.
BUT I'LL BE JUST FINE, LEHM.

361
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,000
I CAN HANDLE IT.
ALTHOUGH, I WOULDN'T PROTEST

362
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,958
IF KOKO OFFERED ME
A COMFORTING EMBRACE!

363
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:55,708
KOKO!  I NEED YOU
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER!

364
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,041
KOKO!
- THAT'S ONE WEIRD CHICK.

365
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,333
- PERFECT.

366
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:03,125
THIS SHOULD BE
MY SECRET HIDING PLACE.

367
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,291
- Kasper: YOU KNOW SOMETHING--

368
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,750
WE'LL NEVER SEE EYE TO EYE,
YOU AND ME.

369
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
I SEE WHY YOU'RE SO STRONG,

370
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,958
A BOY SOLDIER
FROM THE ALPINE UNIT.

371
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,375
I TOOK THE PRIVILEGE
OF LOOKING INTO YOU.

372
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,666
IT'S THE DAMNDEST THING.

373
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,750
TURNS OUT I WAS THE ONE
WHO SUPPLIED WEAPONS

374
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,333
TO THE MEN
WHO TARGETED YOUR VILLAGE.

375
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,041
SO INDIRECTLY, AT LEAST,

376
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,625
I'M THE ONE WHO
KILLED YOUR PARENTS.

377
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,500
- YOU BASTARD!

378
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,875
- HAVE YOU GROWN TOO WEAK
TO TEAR AWAY MY FLESH?

379
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,333
OR ARE YOU HOLDING BACK?
- ( sobbing )

380
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:39,208
- SEE?
THAT'S WHAT FEAR DOES TO YOU.

381
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,041
YOU SAT IN HERE FOR DAYS,
FEARING YOUR DEATH,

382
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,541
UNTIL YOU FINALLY FIGURED OUT

383
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,666
WHERE YOU REALLY
STAND IN THE WORLD.

384
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,833
YOU HAD TO DECIDE
WHICH WAS THE BETTER COURSE--

385
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,791
KILLING ME OR USING ME.

386
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,958
VERY WELL.
LET'S NEGOTIATE.

387
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,791
YOU SEE, I LIKE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW THEIR PLACE.

388
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,833
SO I'M CERTAIN
WE CAN ARRIVE AT TERMS

389
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,166
THAT ARE FAVORABLE FOR US BOTH.

390
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,625
- THE OTHER KIDS.
WHERE ARE THEY?

391
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,041
- HMM!
THEY'RE IN MY CUSTODY.

392
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:10,708
- SEND THEM SOMEPLACE SAFE,
SOMEWHERE THEY CAN BE HAPPY.

393
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:14,208
- MY TERRITORY RUNS FROM HERE
THROUGH MOST OF ASIA.

394
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,916
I'M SURE I CAN SET
THEM UP WITH GOOD HOMES

395
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,791
IN JAPAN OR SOMEWHERE.

396
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,500
CONSIDER IT DONE.

397
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,625
NOW WHAT DO YOU HAVE
TO OFFER ME?

398
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:25,333
- I HAVE NOTHING TO TRADE.

399
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,000
- NOT TRUE.

400
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,083
YOU HAVE YOUR SKILL
AS A SOLDIER.

401
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,500
YOU'D WORK WELL
AS A PERSONAL SECURITY GUARD.

402
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,666
SOUND GOOD?

403
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,208
GREAT.
THEN WE HAVE A DEAL.

404
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,250
THE SISTER I MENTIONED
HAS A PLACE FOR YOU.

405
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,875
NOW I ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER,
BUT I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOU.

406
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,875
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
- MY NAME IS--

407
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,291
- YOU'RE JONATHAN MAR.
THAT RIGHT?

408
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,541
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
JONAH.

409
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,375
I'M KOKO HEKMATYAR.

410
00:21:56,458 --> 00:22:00,083
THAT'S A FROSTY GLARE
IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE.

411
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:05,750
DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL MELT THAT ICE.

412
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:11,250
- ( theme music playing )

413
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

414
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,083
- ♪ CONTROL, CONTROL ♪

415
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:42,166
