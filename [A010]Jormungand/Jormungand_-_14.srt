1
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,333
- THE C.I.A. HAS FOUR DISTINCT
TYPES OF POSITION

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,166
THAT OVERSEE THEIR SPIES.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,333
BUT THE KIND THAT MAKE ME
WANNA TURN AND RUN

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,958
WHEN I ENCOUNTER THEM
IN THE FIELD

5
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,375
IS THE P.O.O.--
THE PARAMILITARY.

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,208
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CARRY OUT
THE AGENCY'S COMBAT OPERATIONS.

7
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:26,208
- Man: HEX?
WHAT, LIKE A HEXAGON?

8
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,916
- NAH, IT'S GERMAN.
SHORT FOR, LIKE, WITCH.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,875
- ( gun fires )

10
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,125
- JUST PUTTING A BULLET IN KOKO
WON'T BE ANY FUN.

11
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,541
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT IN THIS WORLD

12
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,583
WOULD HURT HER MOST...

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,250
AND THEN DESTROY IT.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,083
- ♪... TIME TIME TIME TIME
TO ATTACK. ♪

15
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,208
- I THINK WE TOOK
A WRONG TURN BACK THERE.

16
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:53,375
- Lutz: WHAT?
- ( tires screech )

17
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,541
- ALL THE DAMN ROADS
LOOK THE SAME.

18
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:00,916
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,666
- IT'S ALL RIGHT,
LITTLE LADY.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,625
NO ONE'S ON YOUR CASE
ABOUT THIS.

21
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,750
- Jonah: IT'S PRETTY HERE.

22
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,500
- MAKES YOU WONDER WHY
PEOPLE WOULD CHOOSE

23
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:13,375
A PLACE LIKE THIS
TO FIGHT A WAR.

24
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,583
YOU KNOW, A FEW A YEARS
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,

25
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,666
THIS VALLEY WAS THE SITE
OF EUROPE'S BLOODIEST BATTLE

26
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,166
SINCE WORLD WAR II.

27
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,416
- WELL,
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME.

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,958
EVERYONE FIGHTS OVER IT

29
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,291
BECAUSE THEY WANT THE BEAUTY
ALL TO THEMSELVES.

30
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,708
- GOOD POINT.

31
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:30,041
GUESS I NEVER
LOOKED AT IT THAT WAY.

32
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,875
YOU'RE A WISE KID.

33
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,916
- ( theme music playing )


34
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,833
- SOCCHI REPORTING,

35
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:19,333
AS REQUESTED, SIR.

36
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,958
- HE'S YOUNG.
STILL FOLLOWS ORDERS.

37
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,875
SEEMS WE'RE OFF
TO A GOOD START.

38
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,791
- THIS IS
SERGEANT RENATO SOCCHI.

39
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,625
HE RUNS OUR INTEL GATHERING OPS
ON THE LOCALS.

40
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,416
- HELLO,
MY NAME IS GEORGE BLACK.

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,375
I HEAR YOU'RE GOOD
WITH GROUND INTEL.

42
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,083
YOU MIND GIVING ME A HAND
FOR A BIT?

43
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:42,041
- Man: BLACK IS C.I.A.,
SERGEANT. HELP HIM.

44
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,250
THE ITALIAN ARMY'S ALWAYS HAPPY
TO RELAY VITAL INTELLIGENCE

45
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,166
TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS.

46
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,166
PLEASE GIVE MR. BLACK
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

47
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,583
- UH, RIGHT.
I'LL DO MY BEST, SIR.

48
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,583
- ( car starts )
- OWE YA ONE.

49
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,791
- <i>GRAZIE, BURATTINAIO.</i>

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,750
- "PUPPETMASTER," HUH?

51
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,166
- IT'S A NICKNAME,
RENATO.

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,083
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO COME UP WITH YOUR OWN FOR ME.

53
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,541
WE'LL BE WORKING TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE.

54
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,083
- THE NAME I CAME UP
WITH FOR HIM WAS "SAW".

55
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,708
AT THAT POINT, A JAGGED
BLADE WAS HOW I VIEWED

56
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,791
THE C.I.A.'S TACTICS.

57
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,500
BUT SAW WAS CAREFUL,
PRECISE.

58
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,666
WITH MY INTEL,
HE ORCHESTRATED THE KILLINGS

59
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,250
OF DOZENS
OF BOSNIAN WAR CRIMINALS.

60
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,250
I QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD
WHY OTHERS CALLED HIM

61
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,125
"THE PUPPETEER."

62
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,583
HE CONTROLLED AN ARMY
OF AGENTS IN THE REGION.

63
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,541
AND THE FUEL
THAT KEPT THEM MOVING,

64
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:36,583
AND HIM POWERFUL,
WAS INFORMATION.

65
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:40,083
I NEVER QUITE KNEW HOW MANY
OTHER AGENTS HE HAD LIKE ME.

66
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,291
BUT I DO KNOW HE CONTROLLED
ALL OF US,

67
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,500
MANIPULATING OUR HEARTS
AND MINDS PERFECTLY,

68
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,500
ALL FOR THE GREATER MISSION.

69
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,250
AND WITH HIS MANY SUCCESSES,

70
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,375
SAW QUICKLY ROSE
THROUGH THE RANKS.

71
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,958
- ( tires squeal )

72
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,125
- AHH, SON OF A--

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,166
( thinking ) WHERE IS
THE PEACEKEEPING FORCE?

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,208
DAMN IT!

75
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,916
"KILL ANYONE SUSPICIOUS."

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,375
THOSE WERE ALWAYS
THE BAD GUYS' ORDERS.

77
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,708
I WATCHED HELPLESSLY

78
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,333
AS THE MILITIA
IN THE REPUBLIC OF T

79
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,166
EXECUTED EVERY CIVILIAN
WHO EVEN LOOKED AT THEM FUNNY.

80
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,625
THAT MEANT IT WAS ONLY
A MATTER OF TIME

81
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:21,958
BEFORE THE NUMBER CAME UP
ON MY SOURCE AND HIS FAMILY.

82
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,375
- ( tires squeal )

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,666
- ( blades whirring )

84
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,458
- TOO SLOW!

85
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,458
SPEED IS WHAT KEEPS
YOUR SOURCES ALIVE.

86
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,916
IF YOU'RE EVEN A HALF SECOND
SLOWER THAN YOUR ENEMIES,

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,291
YOU'LL BE ZIPPING YOUR CIVILIAN
FRIENDS INTO BODY BAGS!

88
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,041
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU LOST THAT UNIFORM

89
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,875
AND OFFICIALLY
JOINED THE COMPANY.

90
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,041
IT'LL BE FUN.

91
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:07,250
- R: ALL MY RECORDS FROM WHEN I
WAS IN THE BERSAGLIERI ARE REAL.

92
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,958
BUT EVERYTHING AFTER, UP THROUGH
JOINING KOKO'S CREW, IS FAKE.

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,125
I WORK FOR SAW.
I CAN'T BETRAY HIM.

94
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,041
- Black: THIRD SPECIAL OPS,

95
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,125
WIDE-RANGE
RADIO COMM PLATOON.

96
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,708
THE SO-CALLED W.W. PLATOON
WAS AN ABORTED ATTEMPT

97
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,375
TO CREATE
AN ALL-FEMALE SPECIAL OPS GROUP

98
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,500
MADE UP ENTIRELY
OF WEST POINT GRADS.

99
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:41,583
HEX HAD ALREADY MADE LIEUTENANT
WHEN SHE GOT THE CALL.

100
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,333
THE SQUAD DID SO WELL,

101
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,291
THEY WERE EVEN ALLOWED
TO WEAR GREEN BERET KIT.

102
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,333
BUT THE UNIT
NEVER HAD FULL BACKING.

103
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,750
BRASS SHUT IT DOWN WHEN TOO
MANY OF THE WOMEN DROPPED OUT.

104
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,708
AT LEAST,
THAT WAS THEIR OFFICIAL REASON.

105
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,416
THE TRUTH IS, MANY GENERALS
SIMPLY REMAINED UNCOMFORTABLE

106
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,666
WITH FEMALE SOLDIERS,

107
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,125
SO THEY COOKED UP AN EXCUSE.

108
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,333
TO KEEP THE WOMEN QUIET,

109
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,000
THEY WERE BOUGHT OFF
WITH PROMOTIONS.

110
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,125
EXCEPT FOR HEX.
SHE REBELLED AND QUIT.

111
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,541
THAT'S WHEN A RECRUITER
FOR THE COMPANY

112
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,375
INVITED HER INTO THE SPY GAME.

113
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,958
I MET WITH HER MYSELF
AROUND THAT TIME

114
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,458
TO FEEL HER OUT.

115
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:22,333
SHE STRUCK ME AS A TRUE PATRIOT.
CONFIDENT TOO.

116
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,333
HEX CAME RIGHT OUT
AND SAID

117
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:26,875
SHE WAS A BETTER SOLDIER
THAN ANY MAN.

118
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:29,208
THE MORNING OF 9/11,

119
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,208
HEX'S FIANCE DIED
IN ONE OF THE TOWERS.

120
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,958
SHE WAS ALREADY IN EASTERN
EUROPE, SERVING AS A P.O.O.,

121
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,750
SO SHE FLEW TO AFGHANISTAN
AND PROMPTLY WENT TO WORK.

122
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,250
BUT EVEN IN THOSE CRAZY DAYS,
HER BRAND OF TERRORIST HUNTING

123
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,500
STARTED SKIRTING
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

124
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:51,958
SHE DEEPLY LOVES THIS COUNTRY,
BUT THE FEELING'S NOT MUTUAL.

125
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,958
SHE'S BECOME SO DESTRUCTIVE,

126
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,416
I'VE BEEN ORDERED
TO KEEP HER UNDER MY THUMB.

127
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,375
SO I INCLUDED HEX
IN OPERATION UNDERSHAFT.

128
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,833
THIS WAY, I CAN KEEP HER FROM
USING COUNTER-TERRORISM

129
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,250
AS AN EXCUSE TO DESTROY
A PERFECTLY GOOD ARMS NETWORK.

130
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,791
- ( cell phone vibrating )

131
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:14,666
- YEAH, THIS IS HEX.
GOODNESS.

132
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,125
I CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM YOU IN A LONG TIME.

133
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,833
- YOU'RE DOING WELL, I HOPE?

134
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,958
I'M AFRAID
SOMETHING URGENT'S COME UP.

135
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:25,041
I WAS WONDERING, HAVE YOU
SENT OUT ANY HIT MEN LATELY?

136
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,666
AFTER THE ARMS DEALER
KOKO HEKMATYAR?

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,333
- I DON'T FOLLOW, CHIEF.

138
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,916
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET AT HERE?

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,041
OH, WAIT.  I SEE.

140
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:39,875
OPERATION UNDERSHAFT IS REALLY
ALL ABOUT HEKMATYAR, ISN'T IT?

141
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,791
BACK IN EASTERN EUROPE,
WE MAY HAVE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

142
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,583
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
ORDERING A HIT

143
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,083
HASN'T EVEN CROSSED MY MIND
THIS TIME AROUND.

144
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,041
- THEN EVERYTHING IS CALM.
THAT'S GOOD.

145
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,083
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.
BYE, HEX.

146
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,541
- ( laughing )
SPY MASTER.

147
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,041
ONE LITTLE PHONE CALL,

148
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,041
AND CHIEF BLACK
COMPLETELY TIES MY HANDS.

149
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:07,500
AT LEAST HE HOPES SO.
BUT I'VE GOT A LOOPHOLE.

150
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,625
THERE ARE WAYS TO
DESTROY PEOPLE'S LIVES

151
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,875
WITHOUT KILLING THEM.

152
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,333
- ( gunfire )

153
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,041
- YOU'D THINK AN ARMS DEALER
WOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS

154
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,458
ABOUT USING UP HER OWN PRODUCT.
WE'VE GOT A SNIPER!

155
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,166
SMOKE GRENADE.
COVER US!

156
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,666
- OH!

157
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,333
- DAMN IT.
I SAID "SNIPER."

158
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,083
EVERYONE ON THE CHANNEL,
LAUREN'S DEAD.

159
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,000
- ( gunfire continues )

160
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,750
- ( gun firing )
- ( grunts )

161
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,833
- ( bullet zings )
- ( thinking ) MOTHERFUCKER!

162
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,500
EVEN WITH THE SMOKE COVER,

163
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:53,500
THEY'RE TRACKING OUR OUTLINES
IN THE MOONLIGHT.

164
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,583
SHE MUST HAVE GUYS
WITH SPECIAL OPS EXPERIENCE.

165
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,541
IF WE CAN'T
TURN THE TABLES AGAIN,

166
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,000
WE'LL GO FROM HUNTERS,
TO HUNTED, TO DEAD.

167
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:06,833
KOKO HEKMATYAR,
THE ARMS DEALER, THE TERRORIST.

168
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,625
I CAN'T LET YOU LIVE.

169
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,750
( aloud ) DON'T STOP SHOOTING
UNTIL THEY'RE ALL DEAD!

170
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,250
- Men: HA!
- MOVE.

171
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,291
- Echo:
YOU'RE AMERICAN TOO, HUH?

172
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,416
EITHER WAY, I CAN'T LET YOU
KILL THE LITTLE LADY.

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,250
- ( fires )

174
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,208
- ( gasps )

175
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,708
- ( thinking )
I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO SLEEP

176
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,500
WHEN THERE'S A FULL MOON.

177
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,541
- ( panting )

178
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:06,541
I'M SCARED.
PLEASE SAVE ME, VALMET!

179
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,958
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

180
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,666
I'M PAYING YOU.
YOU HAVE TO SAVE ME!

181
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,291
- Valmet: KOKO!

182
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,250
- Echo: DON'T CRY, LITTLE LADY.
- ( gun rattles )

183
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,708
I GOT YOUR BACK.

184
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:29,041
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME
ONE RED CENT TO DO IT, EITHER.

185
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,541
- ECHO, HAVE YOU BEEN SHOT?

186
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:38,541
OH GOD.  ECHO!

187
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,791
- BUT I DO
HAVE JUST ONE CONDITION.

188
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,666
WHAT DO I ALWAYS TELL YOU?

189
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,291
A LEADER SHOULD ALWAYS SMILE,
NOT SCOWL AND THREATEN.

190
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:50,083
THAT IS THE KEY
TO THE LIFE WE LEAD.

191
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,916
- Koko: I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO
SLEEP WHEN THERE'S A FULL MOON.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,916
- Amalia: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I LOVE YOU, KOKO.

193
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,666
- MY PLEASURE.

194
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,083
I'M GLAD YOU DECIDED
TO GO WITH US, MS. TOROHOVSKY.

195
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:20,041
- YOU'RE A REAL LIFE-SAVER.
WITH THE NEW REGULATIONS,

196
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,875
I COULD NEVER
HAVE IMPORTED THESE.

197
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,583
AND I DO LOVE
JAPANESE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

198
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:28,125
BY THE WAY, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING UNTOWARD LATELY,

199
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,208
- HAVE YOU?
- Huh? ( laughs )

200
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,041
- NO,
I'VE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY BORING.

201
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,375
WHY DO YOU ASK?
- A FRIEND OF MINE

202
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,625
IN FRANCE'S GENERAL DIRECTORATE
FOR EXTERNAL SECURITY,

203
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,000
WELL, HE SAYS THAT YOU
HAVE SOME C.I.A. TRACKING YOU

204
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,916
AND THAT ALL OF THEM
ARE TOP-NOTCH AGENTS.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,666
SOME OF THE SCARIEST HARD-ASSES
HE'S EVER SEEN.

206
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,750
PLEASE, BE CAREFUL, KOKO.

207
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,833
- ( thinking ) IF SHE HEARD THAT
FROM THE D.G.S.E.,

208
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:52,166
THEY'RE SNOOPING AROUND
MY BUSINESS TOO.

209
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,250
I THINK IT'S TIME
WE GOT OUT OF FRANCE.

210
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,458
- C.I.A. ARE THE HARDEST PESTS

211
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,500
FOR A BUSINESSWOMAN
TO SHAKE, YES?

212
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:00,500
THERE WAS ONE
WHO LATCHED ON TO ME.

213
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,208
WHAT DID HE GO BY?
BOOK MAN, I THINK?

214
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,083
- Koko: YES, BOOK MAN.

215
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,625
REAL NAME, GEORGE BLACK.
RUNS THE EUROPEAN BRANCH

216
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,375
OF THE NATIONAL
CLANDESTINE SERVICE.

217
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,000
ISN'T HE THE GUY WHO MADE A NAME
FOR HIMSELF

218
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,333
RUNNING INTEL
DURING THE YUGOSLAV WARS?

219
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,041
- YES. YOU CERTAINLY KNOW
YOUR ENEMIES. THAT'S MY KOKO.

220
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,041
I ONCE GOT MIXED UP
WITH GEORGE

221
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,583
WHEN HE WAS WORKING
OUT OF HIS AGENCY'S ROME BRANCH.

222
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,083
HE'S AN OLD SCHOOL,
COLD WARRIOR-TYPE.

223
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,083
THINKS HE CAN PULL THE STRINGS
ON ARMS DEALERS

224
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,541
LIKE THEY'RE PUPPETS.
LUCKY FOR ME,

225
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,541
MY D.G.S.E. FRIENDS
GOT HIM OFF MY BACK.

226
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,791
A GUY LIKE HIM
PULLING OUR STRINGS?

227
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,875
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

228
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:41,416
- ( both laughing )

229
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,791
- Lehm: YOU TWO SEEM
TO BE GETTING ALONG.

230
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:47,458
- I JUST THINK
SHE'S AN INTERESTING PERSON.

231
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,500
I DON'T KNOW. SHE THE KIND OF
WOMAN WHO COULD DO ANYTHING--

232
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,583
ARMS DEALING JUST HAPPENS TO BE
WHERE SHE WOUND UP.

233
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,666
- FUNNY YOU SAY THAT, KOKO.

234
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,208
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THE SAME ABOUT YOU.

235
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:01,708
- NAH.
THIS IS THE ONLY PATH FOR ME.

236
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,125
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

237
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,291
- ( gun firing )

238
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,666
- Tojo: CRAZY TO THINK
WE'RE IN AN AGE

239
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,833
WHERE EVEN MAGAZINES
ARE PLASTIC.

240
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,041
- GREAT, ISN'T IT?
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

241
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,916
I'M SETTING ALL OF YOU GUYS UP
WITH BRAND NEW GEAR.

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,875
SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW LITTLE
FRIEND, THE MAGPUL MASADA.

243
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,041
- All: OOOH!
- GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

244
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:36,458
I WAS KIND OF WORRIED
YOU WERE ALL GONNA GO, "'KAY."

245
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:37,666
- IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'VE BEEN HAVING

246
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,166
ANY PROBLEMS WITH
THE CURRENT RIFLES.

247
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,791
- AHA!

248
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,083
I KNEW YOU WOULD SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, JONAH.

249
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,458
MY PLAN IS FOR THE WHOLE
UNIT TO USE THE SAME TYPE

250
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:46,875
OF AMMO AND MAGAZINES.

251
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,083
THAT WAY WE CAN ALWAYS
HELP EACH OTHER OUT IN A PINCH.

252
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,750
- MMM.

253
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:54,541
- Lutz: THIS GONNA GO
FOR SIDEARMS TOO, LITTLE LADY?

254
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,500
- FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

255
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,416
THIS IS YOUR NEW HANDGUN.

256
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,416
THE SIG SAUER S.P. 2022.

257
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,416
LIKE WITH THE RIFLES,

258
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,750
THE IDEA IS FOR EVERYONE
TO USE THE SAME CALIBER ROUNDS.

259
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,166
ANYONE WHO WASN'T
USING .9mm BEFORE, YOU ARE NOW.

260
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,083
- WELL, DON'T JUST SHOW IT OFF,
FIRE SOME ROUNDS.

261
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,875
- ( laughs )
ALL RIGHTY.

262
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,166
IF YOU CAN'T MATCH MY SHOOTING,
YOU'LL BE PUNISHED.

263
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,458
- AW, THANKS
FOR OPENING YOUR BIG MOUTH, R.

264
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,583
NOW WE GOTTA PLAY HER GAME.
- Ugo: THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSSIBLE.

265
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,750
- ( tires squeal )

266
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,208
- TOO SLOW, BOYS!

267
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,125
AT THIS RATE,
YOU'LL BE SHOT TO PIECES.

268
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:49,375
- JONAH, WRONG SPOT.
- OH, SORRY.

269
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,916
- RUN THE DRILL AGAIN.

270
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,500
- ( tires squeal )

271
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,083
- OH, SHIT. SORRY!
- AW, COME ON.

272
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,791
- Lehm: DON'T LET THE PERSON
YOU'RE PROTECTING FALL.

273
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,208
- LUTZ, SON OF A BITCH!

274
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:08,208
- DUDE,
THAT'S WHY I SAID I'M SORRY.

275
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,958
OH, MAN, YOU LOOK
LIKE FREAKIN' TWO-FACE.

276
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,916
- Tojo: DON'T LAUGH.
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

277
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
- OH, COME ON NOW, GUYS.

278
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,208
DON'T WANT
ANY TWO-FACES HERE.

279
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,083
- Lehm: ALL RIGHT, AGAIN.
LIVE AMMO THIS TIME.

280
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,208
- LET ME GET SOME WATER FIRST,
CHIEF.

281
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,000
- R?
- WHAT'S UP?

282
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,916
- YOU KNOW A C.I.A. AGENT?
PEOPLE CALL HIM BOOK MAN?

283
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,541
- YEAH, I'M FAMILIAR WITH HIM.

284
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,291
MET HIM IN BOSNIA,
WHEN I WAS STILL ITALIAN ARMY.

285
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,291
HE NEEDED SOME INTELLIGENCE
I HAD ON LOCAL WARLORDS,

286
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,000
SO I HELPED HIM OUT
A FEW TIMES.

287
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,958
BOOK MAN, BURATTINAIO,
ADEEB.

288
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,875
HIS REAL NAME WAS--
- MISTER GEORGE BLACK.

289
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN BRANCH.
- WELL THEN,

290
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,375
YOU'VE ALREADY
DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

291
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,333
- I'VE HEARD RUMORS
ABOUT HIM TRACKING US,

292
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:52,166
SO I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT YOU KNEW

293
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,291
SINCE I FIGURED YOU'D
ACTUALLY MET HIM IN PERSON.

294
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,000
- WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
HE'S A BIG EATER.

295
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,708
HE HAD A LITTLE GUT
ON HIM THEN,

296
00:16:57,791 --> 00:17:00,291
SO BY NOW
HE COULD LOOK LIKE SANTA CLAUS.

297
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,916
- I GUESS WORKING FOR THE C.I.A.
MAKES YOU STRESS-EAT.

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,791
LOOK AT SCHOKOLADE.

299
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,291
- I KNOW BOOK MAN'S
GOOD WITH LANGUAGES.

300
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,583
HE MAJORED IN ARABIAN LITERATURE
AS AN UNDERGRAD,

301
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,875
SO THAT'S WHERE
THE ADEEB NICKNAME COMES FROM.

302
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,166
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD ME,

303
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,000
THOUGH I THINK IT
MEANS SOMETHING ELSE.

304
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,916
SEE,
WHEN HE INVESTIGATES SOMETHING,

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
HE MAKES IT A POINT
TO LEARN EVERY DETAIL HE CAN,

306
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,000
LIKE A SCHOLAR.

307
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,958
- AH, GOOD TO KNOW.

308
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,708
- DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT THOSE HIT MEN SAID?

309
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,916
DIDN'T THEY MENTION SOMETHING
ABOUT THE C.I.A.?

310
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,458
- NO.  BOOK MAN
CAME UP IN SOME OTHER RUMORS.

311
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,750
I THINK THE HIT MAN STUFF
IS A COINCIDENCE.

312
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,708
I CAN'T SEE
SOMEONE AS HIGH UP

313
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,166
AS THE EURO BRANCH CHIEF
PLAYING THAT CARD.

314
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,041
EVER HEAR OF ANOTHER AGENT
WHO GOES BY HEX?

315
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,458
A PARAMILITARY
OPERATIONS OFFICER?

316
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:49,458
YOU KNOW, P.O.O.?
- SORRY, DON'T KNOW HIM.

317
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:52,291
DOES HIS FACE
HAVE SIX SIDES OR SOMETHING?

318
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,791
- SHE'S A SHE.
HEX AS IN WITCH.

319
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,125
- WHOA, FROM THE SOUND OF IT,

320
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,125
YOU'VE HAD A RUN-IN
WITH HER BEFORE.

321
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,166
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

322
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,958
YOU KNOW,
SPARE YOU THE BAD MEMORIES.

323
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,833
AND DON'T FORGET,
YOU GOT US NOW.

324
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,833
NO MATTER HOW NASTY YOUR
ENEMIES MAY BE, LITTLE LADY,

325
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,458
THIS SQUAD WILL KEEP YOU SAFE.

326
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,791
- Lehm: R!
- YEAH?

327
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,708
- BURNIN' DAYLIGHT.
- COMING.

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
- TOO SLOW LIKE THAT,
JONAH.

329
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,083
TRACE OVER YOUR TARGET
WITH THE MUZZLE.

330
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,750
NICE AND SMOOTH.

331
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:25,750
SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER
JUST AS THEY MEET,

332
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:29,000
AND YOU'LL HIT CLEAN
EVERY TIME.  WATCH ME.

333
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,458
YOUR TARGETS'LL
ALMOST ALWAYS BE MOVING TOO.

334
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,333
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP UP,
YOU WON'T HIT 'EM.

335
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,125
- GOT IT.
- Both: DAMN, HE'S GOOD.

336
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,166
- ( thinking ) HEX.
WHO THE HELL IS SHE?

337
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,291
I HAVE TO KNOW.

338
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,000
- NO MATTER HOW MANY WE KILL,
THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE.

339
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,291
LIKE ROACHES.

340
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,625
WE CAN'T MAKE
ANY LASTING PROGRESS

341
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,041
AGAINST THEM
UNTIL WE FIND THE SOURCE.

342
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,791
YOU HEAR ME,
TEAM CUTTHROAT?

343
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,791
EVEN WHILE SERVING THE WORST
YEARS OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,

344
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,208
THE MILITARY COULDN'T ACCEPT
YOUR UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS.

345
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,750
ALWAYS HOUNDED BY THE M.P.s.

346
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:21,958
BUT NOW YOU'RE MY ARMY
AND YOUR METHODS ARE MY METHODS.

347
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,791
TEN-HUT!  MOVE OUT.

348
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,166
- ( all firing guns )

349
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,166
- Woman: WE HAVE VISUAL ON HEX
AND TEAM CUTTHROAT.

350
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,041
- ( cell phone vibrating )

351
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,125
- KEEP TRACKING THEM.

352
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:56,208
- ( cell phone vibrating )

353
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:15,166
- HOW 'BOUT THIS ONE,
THIS ONE AND THAT?

354
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,416
- NO PROBLEM, MR. BLACK.
I'LL HAVE THAT RIGHT OUT.

355
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,500
- ( cell phone vibrating )

356
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,208
- ( theme music playing )


357
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,250
- ( European siren wailing )
- Black: HELLO, R.

358
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,375
- IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU PICKED UP THE PHONE.

359
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:22,541
WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING
ON ANSWERING MY QUESTION?

360
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,166
THINK I SENT YOU THAT FIRST TEXT
ABOUT 10 HOURS AGO.

361
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,875
YOU TAUGHT ME SPEED WAS
EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME.

362
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,250
SO MUCH FOR THAT.

363
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,791
- I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND
THE DELAY IN MY RESPONSE

364
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:34,458
MEANT YOU WERE ASKING A QUESTION
I'M NOT ABLE TO ANSWER.

365
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:36,791
JUST KNOW
SHE'S A DEEP-COVER AGENT.

366
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:39,916
THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.

367
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,541
I WOULDN'T TELL SOMEONE
ABOUT YOU, EITHER.

368
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,083
- YEAH, DEEP COVER, MY ASS.

369
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,791
SHE'S ACTING RIGHT OUT
IN THE OPEN.

370
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,041
WE'VE ALREADY HAD RUN-INS
WITH HER ASSASSINS.

371
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,458
I'LL TELL YOU
WHO I THINK SHE IS, SAW.

372
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:51,875
I THINK HEX IS THE ONE BEHIND

373
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:54,000
ALL THE RECENT ATTEMPTS
ON OUR GROUP.

374
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,916
ARE YOU OKAY WITH
SOME ROGUE AGENT 

375
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,916
SCREWING OPERATION UNDERSHAFT?

376
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,541
BECAUSE YOU PROMISED

377
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,625
YOU WERE GONNA
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

378
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,250
- I HEAR YOU, R.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK SOON.

379
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:14,041
R., YOU ARE MY RIGHT ARM
AND HEX IS MY LEFT.

380
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,625
AS SUCH, SHE WILL CONTINUE
TO BE A CRITICAL PLAYER

381
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:18,916
IN ALL
OF MY DEPARTMENT'S ACTIVITIES.

382
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
SHE'S STAYING
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

383
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,916
ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT LEFT ARM

384
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,458
IS ATTACHED TO A FIST
THAT SMASHES TERRORISTS.

385
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:31,125
IF SHE WANTS A SACRIFICE,
WE MAY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO HER.

386
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:35,916
EVEN IF IT'S THE LIFE
OF A SINGLE CHILD.

SHE IS-- OH NO ♪
