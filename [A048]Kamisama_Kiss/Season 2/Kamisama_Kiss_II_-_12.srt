1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,125
[NARRATOR] We just have to
pass through these, right?

2
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,833
Yay! Ha, ha.

3
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:15,000
Tomoe! That was little Nanami!

4
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,583
Mommy!

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,666
Her mother is suffering in
secret from a long illness.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,375
It is doubtful she will
live much longer.

7
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:57,125
[TOMOE] Seeing Nanami at this
tender age is fascinating.

8
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:59,333
I can hardly recognize her.

9
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,000
[NANAMI]
It's so yummy, mommy!

10
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,500
I'm glad you like it, sweetie!

11
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,041
I'm putting the leftovers
in the freezer

12
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,833
so you can have more later. Uh.

13
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:17,625
Ah! The money I hid in
the freezer to pay

14
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,083
this month's electric
bill isn't there!

15
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:22,916
But how? Ah... Curse you.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,750
That was the best hiding spot I
could come up with. [coughs]

17
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,000
Snap! It's my lucky day!

18
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,375
Mommy, do you
feel yucky again?

19
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,708
Oh. I'm all right, don't worry.

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:38,791
I'm sorry, Nanami. Listen to me.
Maybe someday,

21
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,875
mommy's gonna have
to go away for a while.

22
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,333
If that happens,
I need you to be a big girl

23
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,041
and take care of yourself, okay?

24
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,708
You'll have to clean the house
and lock the doors every night.

25
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,458
Will I be all alone?
What about daddy?

26
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:54,083
What about daddy? Don't you dare
count on that good-for-nothing

27
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,458
father of yours, and do not tell
him where you keep your money!

28
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,041
I don't care if
he begs and cries,

29
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,625
you keep it to
yourself. Capiche?

30
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,083
[NANAMI]
Okay.

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:03,500
My poor little girl.

32
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,541
I wish I could have given
you a brother or a sister.

33
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,458
Our family line has
been entirely female.

34
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,708
Every mother has
had one daughter.

35
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,000
It was like that for me,
and your grandma,

36
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,333
and your great-grandma.

37
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:18,750
[NANAMI]
Why?

38
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,125
I wanna have a big
brother, mommy!

39
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:25,250
Oh? But there's more to the
story you haven't heard, yet.

40
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,958
Once upon a time,
so she could be pretty,

41
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,750
one of our sillier ancestors
drank a special beauty potion

42
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,583
given to her by the gods.
Well, ever since then,

43
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,000
each generation of our family
has been blessed with only one

44
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,500
healthy and adorable baby girl.

45
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,958
And you're my one! Look at you!

46
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,583
The prettiest and smartest
girl in our family!

47
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:46,041
[NANAMI giggles]

48
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,333
But this blessing came at
a price. We've been cursed.

49
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,041
None of us ever found a man
that wasn't worthless!

50
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,958
They've all been deadbeats
that suck the life out of us!

51
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,500
Listen to me, sweetie.

52
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,958
Under no circumstances
can you count on men.

53
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,625
I want you to grow
up big and strong,

54
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,166
and live a long healthy life,

55
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,041
even if that means you have to
stay single to do it. Okay?

56
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,250
Kay! When I get big
I'm gonna stay single

57
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,541
and do everything all by myself!

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,583
[NANAMI'S MOTHER]
Great!

59
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:16,208
[TOMOE] I see. Nanami
inherited her nerves of steel

60
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,541
from her late mother.
Interesting.

61
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,291
Human children all grow up
by watching their parents.

62
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,958
Nanami is no different.

63
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,291
Her parents set the example
of whom she would become.

64
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,791
Can you tell me why
you've become

65
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:31,458
so comfortable sitting here?
I can understand wanting

66
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,958
to get your fill of this
cute little Nanami.

67
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:38,875
But you realize, these are just
her memories, none of it's real.

68
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:43,458
We gain nothing by seeing this.
Meanwhile, she's in pain.

69
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:48,166
We should lead her back
out of this nightmare.

70
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,000
[TOMOE]
Yes. You are correct.

71
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:58,583
[TOMOE]
But even so. I have to see more.

72
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,416
This is a side of her
that I do not know.

73
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,125
[TOMOE]
Just a little longer.

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,083
[NANAMI'S FATHER laughs]

75
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,041
[NANAMI'S FATHER snores]

76
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,041
[TOMOE]
Just a little more.

77
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:26,375
[CHILDREN laughing]

78
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,583
[MOE]
Hey, Emii.

79
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,375
What did you ask Santa
Claus for this year?

80
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,333
Last year I got a new fashion
doll for Christmas from him.

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,125
This year I'm asking Santa
for a fashion dream house!

82
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,375
That's so cool!

83
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,125
This year, I'm asking
him for a bicycle!

84
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,791
What about you, Nanami?

85
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:44,000
[NANAMI]
I'll be okay.

86
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,375
I take care of my house
and keep my money hidden!

87
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,458
I lock all the doors every
night, so no strange man

88
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:49,833
is gonna get in
while I'm sleeping,

89
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,541
even if he begs and cries!

90
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,000
You should all lock your doors
before you go to sleep, too.

91
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:57,333
You're weird, Nanami!

92
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,875
Santa Claus brings presents
through the chimney!

93
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,916
You're gonna be on
the naughty list!

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,666
I've seen enough!
I can't watch anymore!

95
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,791
The raw emotion is overpowering!

96
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,250
This Santa guy has claws?

97
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,291
You are not helping at all!
Looks like it's up to me!

98
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,541
It's okay, I'll save her.
You sit there, couch potato.

99
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:21,208
[TOMOE] I am not a potato.
I am learning about Nanami.

100
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,541
No wonder she developed such
spirit; 'tis how she survived.

101
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,208
She surely would've
been crushed

102
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,833
under the weight of
all this without it.

103
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,833
[TOMOE]
The poor girl.

104
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,416
[MIZUKI]
Nanami, dear!

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,666
[NANAMI]
Huh?

106
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,375
[MIZUKI]
Long time no see!

107
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,041
[NANAMI]
Hm?

108
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,500
[MIZUKI]
No, don't look at me like that!

109
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,958
I'm here to help you!

110
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:47,541
I'm Mizuki, your primary
and most loyal familiar!

111
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,083
Don't you recognize me?

112
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,000
Uh. I guess there's no way
you could remember me.

113
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,208
[NANAMI]
I do remember you.

114
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,083
[MIZUKI]
Hm?

115
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,083
Stranger danger!

116
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,958
I should have known.

117
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,083
You've got it all wrong. I'm--

118
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,666
[NANAMI panting]

119
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,333
[NANAMI gasping]

120
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,250
Nice save, Tomoe!

121
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,291
[TOMOE] Quickly.
Come with me. We have to run.

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,541
The stranger is closing in.

123
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,000
[MIZUKI]
Hey!

124
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,583
[TOMOE] That is what you get,
you lousy snake.

125
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:39,666
[MIZUKI] Tomoe.
I'm gonna kill you for that!

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,583
[TOMOE]
I swear.

127
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,958
[NANAMI]
Your ears!

128
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:48,166
They're so funny!
Kinda like a cat's!

129
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,958
Can you hear a lot?
Hey, hey!

130
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:54,875
[TOMOE] Why did I get
caught up in this mess?

131
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,333
Well, I suppose we
should head for the exit.

132
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,375
--[NANAMI chatting]
--[TOMOE] Hm?

133
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,458
[TOMOE]
The scenery is rather odd.

134
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,041
I had thought it was blurry,

135
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,875
but some parts are
exceedingly detailed.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,375
[TOMOE]
I see.

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,500
This is the world
of her memories.

138
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:16,541
The more she paid attention
to something back then,

139
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,833
the more clearly it appears now.

140
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,791
[TOMOE]
Would you like some ice cream?

141
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,541
No, uh! That's okay, thanks!

142
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,666
[TOMOE]
'Tis alright.

143
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,041
Oh, wow!

144
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:34,041
That was amazing,
big brother!

145
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,291
[TOMOE]
Uh, big brother?

146
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,875
If there is anything else
you desire, let me know.

147
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,916
I am happy to
fetch it for you.

148
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,083
[TOMOE] In this world,
the things that you long for

149
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,375
are as plain as day. For me,

150
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,250
satisfying those needs
is a simple matter.

151
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:56,458
[NANAMI]
Wow! Is this really my dinner?

152
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,208
Yes.

153
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,583
For real?

154
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:03,458
[TOMOE] Anything you want.
If it will help you smile.

155
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,083
[TOMOE]
I am here.

156
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,416
I will stay by your side.

157
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,458
[TOMOE]
There is no need to be sad.

158
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:28,250
[NANAMI]
Oh. The sun's going down.

159
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,500
[TOMOE]
Her sunset is huge.

160
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:36,333
[NANAMI] The day's over.
Everybody is gonna go home now.

161
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:39,333
I don't wanna go home, though.

162
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:44,791
Back there, nobody
is waiting for me.

163
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,500
I have to be all by myself.

164
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,833
[TOMOE]
I understand.

165
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:56,625
I know what you truly desire.

166
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,541
Only for the time being.

167
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,500
In a few years,
when you are older,

168
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,916
you will become
the head of a household

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,875
more rowdy than you can imagine.

170
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,583
Are you telling me that
I'm gonna get married

171
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,166
when I get bigger?

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,791
And then I'm going to make a new
family to replace my old one?

173
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,541
[TOMOE]
Hm? Oh, well, no.

174
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:20,291
That's good! Because
I'm not getting married!

175
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
And why is that?

176
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,875
Because my family has really
bad luck with dead meat men!

177
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,458
I can't count on a husband,

178
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:29,416
so I'm gonna stay healthy and
single when I get bigger! Uh!

179
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,833
[TOMOE] It is not that
you have bad luck,

180
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,666
but that you are a poor
judge of character.

181
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,083
Take me for example.

182
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:39,333
I could fill all your
days with happiness.

183
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,541
Anything that you wanted,
I would readily provide.

184
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:43,250
There could be no one
more dependable than me

185
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:44,958
for "bringing home the bacon,"
as they say.

186
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,083
[NANAMI]
I get what you're doing!

187
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,750
You can't use yummy
foods to trick me

188
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,916
into a loveless marriage!

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So do you really love me?
I need to know.

190
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,916
[TOMOE] When asked in such
a direct and adorable way.

191
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:12,958
[TOMOE] Yes. How could
I not tell you the truth?

192
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:17,333
I do love you.

193
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,083
Well, will you marry me, Nanami?

194
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:28,791
[TOMOE]
Know this.

195
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,291
I will ensure you always

196
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,041
have that carefree
smile on your face.

197
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,958
Okay!

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,875
[TOMOE] I will always
stand by your side.

199
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,083
[TOMOE] What in the world
am I going to do?

200
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,000
To have become swept
up in the moment

201
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
and proposed to her.

202
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,750
How am going to talk
my way out of this one?

203
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,083
I have truly done it this time.

204
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,708
Tomoe, you asked me
to marry you, right?

205
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,916
[TOMOE]
She is bound to press the issue.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,708
Uh. How can I possibly
get out of this mess?

207
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,833
What is the matter, Tomoe?
You're awfully fidgety.

208
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,291
Don't you worry about a thing,

209
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,291
I can keep a secret
as a fellow familiar.

210
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,625
Nanami will never know what
you did to her as a child.

211
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,833
Wait, seriously?

212
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,625
[MIZUKI] Ah, so you did
do something to her.

213
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,833
[TOMOE growls]

214
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:27,583
[roaring]

215
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,000
[NANAMI]
Stop!

216
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,500
Geez. Why do you guys fight

217
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,291
every time I turn
my back on you?

218
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,750
Hey, where are we?

219
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,500
What happened to
the Torii Gates?

220
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,125
Well, you're on the
other side of them.

221
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,500
[NANAMI]
Huh? When did we go through?

222
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,208
Can't believe I missed that,
I must have fallen asleep.

223
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:46,250
It does feel like I woke up
from a really long dream.

224
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,083
Yeah? What kind of dream?

225
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:51,625
[TOMOE] It would appear
I was worried for nothing.

226
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:54,750
Even if she did remember
what happened,

227
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:58,416
Nanami would believe the
proposal was merely a fantasy.

228
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,000
Nothing more.

229
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,291
[NANAMI]
I dunno.

230
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,666
I can't remember anything;

231
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,416
so it must not have
mattered very much.

232
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,166
Really? Are you sure.

233
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,666
Nothing about a sweet,
handsome stranger?

234
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,375
Did you just say "a stranger"?
That doesn't ring any bells.

235
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,541
[TOMOE] Uh! She really
does not remember?

236
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,916
Right! Enough chitchat!

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,333
Let's get to the
Year God's shrine,

238
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,333
grab the new talisman,
and go back home!

239
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,000
If we don't hurry,
the sun's gonna set!

240
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,666
[MIZUKI] The entrance should
be around here somewhere.

241
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,583
[NANAMI] I've never met
next year's god before;

242
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,666
I wonder what he's like.
Have you ever met him?

243
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,708
Tomoe?

244
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,708
[TOMOE] Is it true?
Does she really not recall?

245
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:45,208
Would you like some
ice cream, Nanami?

246
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,291
Hey! Neato where
did that come from?

247
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,833
Ah! Ice cream,
I've missed you!

248
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,208
[NANAMI] Hold on,
you've had ice cream before?

249
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,458
Uh-huh. Back when
we were at the beach!

250
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,291
In that case,
you should have it.

251
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,958
Oh, you don't mind, right?

252
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,041
[TOMOE groans]

253
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:03,208
[MIZUKI] Can I?
Oh, thank you! Hooray!

254
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,958
[giggles] You're just like a
little kid sometimes, Mizuki.

255
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,708
[TOMOE]
She says with no irony.

256
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,708
Moments ago,
the little kid was her.

257
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,041
Oh that reminds me,

258
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,833
I never knew how much you
take after your mother.

259
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,500
You think I'm like
my mom? I dunno.

260
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,708
I always thought I
took after my dad.

261
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,458
I was really young
when she passed away,

262
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,791
so I hardly knew her.

263
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,375
I can barely even remember
what she looked like.

264
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:31,250
We lost all the photos
of her in the fire.

265
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,000
It would've been nice if one
had survived, but, oh well.

266
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,291
[TOMOE] It seems twelve
years is enough time

267
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,125
for a human to change.

268
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,000
Little Nanami and
the present one.

269
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,416
Though they are
the same person,

270
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,541
are completely different
from one another. 'Tis sad.

271
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,916
[TOMOE]
How can this be?

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,416
What happened to the child?

273
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,666
[NANAMI]
Uh! You okay?

274
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,291
What in the world?

275
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,708
[YEAR GOD]
Hey!

276
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:05,541
[NANAMI, TOMOE, MIZUKI]
Huh?

277
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:08,000
[YEAR GOD]
Hey!

278
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,333
[NANAMI]
Mm.

279
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:13,208
Yo! Are you the human god
from the Mikage Shrine?

280
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,958
Oh, Lord Year God, it's you!

281
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,083
[NANAMI] Wait.
He's the year god?

282
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,000
[YEAR GOD grunts] Sorry I can't
give ya a proper greeting.

283
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
I've gotta try and sheer off all
this wool before the new year.

284
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:25,250
If I don't, we're
gonna have problems.

285
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,333
[NANAMI]
Wool?

286
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,708
[SHEEB baas]

287
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,666
[NANAMI]
What the heck?

288
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,708
[TOMOE]
He is the zodiac sheep.

289
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,250
[MIZUKI]
So this thing is a sheep!

290
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,958
[MIZUKI sighs] Wow!
Hm. I thought it'd be softer.

291
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,208
[YEAR GOD]
I wish.

292
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,958
This dude keeps on
insisting that "the fluff"

293
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,875
is gonna be "all the rage"
next year.

294
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,791
But if I can't get
him trimmed down,

295
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,541
there's no way
he'll fit in the shrine.

296
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,625
[TOMOE]
Then why did you wait

297
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:50,625
until the last minute
to handle this?

298
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,208
Hey, that reminds me!
If it's not too much trouble,

299
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,875
we've actually come here to
get next year's talisman.

300
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,750
Oh. Yeah, the talisman?

301
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,416
It's in there.

302
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,583
[SHEEP]
Baa?

303
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,000
[NANAMI] Hm?!
Wait, that's your shrine?

304
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:05,375
[MIZUKI] It's so small!
No wonder he can't fit inside!

305
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,041
He hasn't budged
since this morning,

306
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:10,083
so I told him it was time for
a haircut, much to his dismay.

307
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,750
[SHEEP]
Baa!

308
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:15,125
[MIZUKI, NANAMI]
Ah!

309
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,000
No, stop! You're
crushing the shrine!

310
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,875
Too bad it's not softer!

311
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,833
Ah. Well.

312
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,875
[YEAR GOD grunts]

313
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,916
All that fluff must
be really heavy.

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,166
[SHEEP baas]

315
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,458
This coming year is
gonna be all about you.

316
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,541
You should try and look
your best for the occasion.

317
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,291
[SHEEP baas]

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,416
I'm kinda jealous!

319
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,416
If I had wool as
wonderful as you've got,

320
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,958
I would be showing it off!

321
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,666
I'd strut my fluff
so everyone could see!

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,791
[SHEEP]
Baa!

323
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,166
What? So I can shear you now?

324
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,666
[TOMOE gasps]

325
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,458
[NANAMI laughs]

326
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,666
You're incredible, Nanami!

327
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,541
[NANAMI]
I know, right?

328
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:57,875
[MIZUKI]
Yup! Incredible!

329
00:16:57,958 --> 00:16:59,583
[TOMOE] Seeing her handle
this with such maturity

330
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,083
makes me miss the child
of twelve years ago.

331
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:11,333
[TOMOE] I feel so much loss.
Yet, also pride.

332
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,291
You have my gratitude,
land god. I thank you.

333
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,291
[TOMOE]
How did it get so small?

334
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,083
[YEAR GOD]
Here is next year's Talisman.

335
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,333
[NANAMI Oh, thank you
very much, Lord Year God!

336
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,083
[YEAR GOD]
One more thing,

337
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:32,333
a present. My way
of saying thanks.

338
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:36,125
I heard you say that after the
fire, you didn't have any left.

339
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,416
But with the memories I saw

340
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,958
while you were in
the Torii Gates of Twelve,

341
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:42,583
I can make you a print.

342
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,375
What is wrong?
Are you all right?

343
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,750
It's my mom.

344
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,416
[TOMOE]
I see.

345
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,041
They have not
vanished after all.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,500
[TOMOE] Neither the child,
nor the mother.

347
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,333
[TOMOE] Even the emotions
she felt back then.

348
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,625
All of these things
live on inside Nanami.

349
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:46,208
Even if she may not remember,
she still carries them with her.

350
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:51,333
[NANAMI]
Oh! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

351
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,291
Please take these ones, too!

352
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,916
[SANITATION WORKER]
Sure thing.

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,125
[NANAMI sighs]

354
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,750
[NANAMI] It's the first New Year
since I became a god.

355
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:07,375
So much has happened.
It's hard to believe.

356
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,000
But I'm getting the hang of it.

357
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,791
The talismans for
the first shrine visits

358
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,666
of the year are done!

359
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,208
Perhaps I'm better at this than

360
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,958
I've been giving
myself credit for!

361
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,583
That is just like you, Nanami,
always so thoughtful.

362
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,041
[NANAMI laughs]

363
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,208
[TOMOE]
Let me see.

364
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,708
Ah! Whadja do that for?

365
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,000
Because any worshiper who
is sorry enough to ask your

366
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,125
blessing should not be further
punished by having to read

367
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,708
your orange-scented
chicken scratches!

368
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,458
[NANAMI gasps]

369
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,166
[NANAMI]
The more I think about it,

370
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,750
the more I realize how
much we've gone through.

371
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,583
[OKUNINUSHI]
Yes, yes.

372
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,208
I know, Grandmother Izanami.

373
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,416
But I am extremely
busy preparing

374
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,291
for the new year right now.

375
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,208
Yes, I have made
the arrangements.

376
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,875
For the last time, I promise you
there will be no doughnuts!

377
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:52,958
[GUARD RABBIT]
Lord Okuninushi,

378
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,916
please look over
these forms as well.

379
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,541
[HIMEMIKO]
I was thinking,

380
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,416
would thou like to
celebrate New Year's?

381
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,416
We could visit
the Mikage Shrine.

382
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,333
[KOTARO]
That's where your friend,

383
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,250
miss Momozono works, right?

384
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,625
Yes, and a day trip
would be so romantic!

385
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,500
[HIMEMIKO] We could start making
our wedding arrangements!

386
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,000
[KOTARO gasps]
Himemiko, I did it!

387
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,375
I set a new personal record!

388
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:17,250
Kota! Next year for sure.
Next year for sure!

389
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:17,791
[HIMEMIKO] We will finally
pledge our lives to one another!

390
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,958
[AOTAKE crying]

391
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,625
[KURAMA]
I thought I told you!

392
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,791
Don't book any work for me until
after the twentieth this month!

393
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,333
[KURAMA]
Mm?

394
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,458
[SUIRO]
My, my!

395
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,375
Doors in the Mundane
World are flimsy.

396
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,375
Master Shinjuro!

397
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,333
Brothers and Botanmaru,
what brings you here?

398
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:37,541
It's been so long
since I've seen you!

399
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:40,416
I'm, uh, glad to see
you're doing okay.

400
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,791
We have come at the request
of Sojobo the Third.

401
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,250
He sends a resolution.

402
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,083
You are to spend the
new year in training,

403
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,166
and refrain from all further
immersion in the mundane world.

404
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,666
As your senior, I have come
to oversee your progress.

405
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,416
[KURAMA]
What?

406
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,291
Now, that is not our
only reason for coming.

407
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,541
We were concerned for
our brother with whom,

408
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,208
by fate, we have been reunited.

409
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,708
Thus we come as representatives
of the mountain

410
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,416
to make sure you are well.

411
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,166
[KURAMA]
Uh.

412
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,625
Also, we thought you
might take us to the shrine

413
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,375
of the Lady Land God who
has done so much for us.

414
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,583
[KURAMA]
Oh.

415
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,833
That explains why Jiro
wanted to tag along.

416
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,875
[NANAMI]
With the year being over,

417
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,041
I can't help but wonder.

418
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,083
What do we have in
store for us next?

419
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,333
[NANAMI]
The time flew by so fast.

420
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,083
We've laughed, and we've cried.

421
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,416
[NANAMI] It's been crazy,
that's for sure.

422
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,833
[NANAMI]
But it's also been a lot of fun.

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,083
[NEWSCASTER]
Hello!

424
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:49,000
[KOTETSU]
Another year comes to an end.

425
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,625
[ONIKIRI] It feels like
last year had just begun.

426
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:56,208
[NANAMI]
I know.

427
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,333
Hey! You guys,
it started snowing!

428
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,500
[NANAMI]
Mm?

429
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,750
[NEWSCASTER]
Happy New Year, everyone!

430
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,250
[NANAMI]
Wow, you're right!

431
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,166
Look, it's already
piling up! Cool!

432
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,375
[TOMOE]
Only for the time being.

433
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,833
[NANAMI gasps]

434
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,791
[TOMOE] In a few years,
when you are older,

435
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,250
you will become the
head of a household

436
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,458
more rowdy than you can imagine.

437
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:37,541
[MIZUKI, ONIKIRI, MAMORU,
KOTETSU shouting]

438
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,875
[NANAMI]
Strange.

439
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,666
I can't remember
who told me that.

440
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:48,166
[MAMORU]
Nanami?

441
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,166
[NANAMI]
Uh?

442
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,416
[MAMORU]
Can you peel this for me?

443
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,666
I can't get it right.

444
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,041
Sure! No problem.

445
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,291
[MAMORU groans]

446
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,708
You can do that yourself,
you stinking brat!

447
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:58,083
That's right!

448
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:00,666
Nanami's not your mom,
so stop acting like a baby!

449
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,250
Calm down.

450
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,791
I don't really mind if Mamoru
thinks of me as his mom for now.

451
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,041
Say "ah."

452
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,250
[MAMORU]
Ah!

453
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,250
Aw. No fair.

454
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,458
Um, Nanami.

455
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,041
You're not planning to
leave us to get married

456
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,916
or anything like that, right?

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,041
I want you to stay our
lady and mistress forever,

458
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:20,083
until you're old and gray and
no man could ever love you!

459
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,541
[NANAMI]
I don't think I like that idea.

460
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,291
Well, I plan on staying
single for a long time.

461
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,875
Or not.

462
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,791
Or not?

463
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,833
[TOMOE chuckles]
