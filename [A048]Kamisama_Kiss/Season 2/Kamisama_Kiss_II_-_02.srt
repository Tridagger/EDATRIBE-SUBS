1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,291
[NARRATOR]
Gods from across the country

2
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,333
gather at the Divine
Assembly in Izumo.

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,375
There's a decent chance
one of those gods might know

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:14,916
the whereabouts of Mikage.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,958
I wonder where in the world
he could have schlepped off to?

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:22,291
What's say we test your worth
by having you hatch a shikigami?

7
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:24,125
Oh no, watch out!

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,625
Thus, Mamoru was born!

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:32,166
And with her barrier against
evil, Nanami is Izumo-bound!

10
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,583
[TOMOE]
A thought has occurred to me.

11
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:08,708
That egg was supposed to take
seven days to hatch, and yet,

12
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,791
when it cracked on the first
day, it already had a base form.

13
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,333
[MAMORU]
Meep?

14
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:16,208
I can only assume you planted
that monkey from the start,

15
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,125
and your true intention
was to raise Nanami

16
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:19,458
to godhood all along.

17
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:20,625
[exhales]

18
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,791
Oh, pooey, you figured me out.

19
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:25,208
I guess foxes really are sly.

20
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,875
Why would you do
something like that?

21
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:28,708
[NANAMI]
Tomoe!

22
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,000
Ugh, where the heck are you?

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,583
You called for me?

24
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,291
It's about time you showed up,
I seriously need your help here.

25
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:36,750
My necklace is
caught in my hair,

26
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,541
and I can't get it out to
save my life! Get it off me!

27
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,708
[sighs] You require
such coddling.

28
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,833
[MAMORU squeaks]

29
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,708
[TOMOE grunts]

30
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,958
Y'know if all you're lookin'
for is a good grooming,

31
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:48,875
you should ask me!

32
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,125
Whoa! You're Mamoru?

33
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,500
No way!

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,333
You look like a cutie-ootie-
wootie little kid, now!

35
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,666
Yup! You cop a squat,
and I'll get that off for y--!

36
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,416
'Tis quite enough
monkey business.

37
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Lest you forget your place,

38
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,500
she came to me looking
for assistance.

39
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,625
Now behave yourself
and keep quiet, chimp.

40
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,041
You leave Mamoru alone,
he's trying to help me!

41
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:09,875
Forget it! I'll get Mizuki
to help me take it off!

42
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:12,000
You really shouldn't be making
your lady and mistress

43
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,000
angry like that.

44
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,333
[TOMOE]
Ugh.

45
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,416
Based on how much this trip
is gonna cost per person,

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,958
I don't think we can afford to
take everyone with me to Izumo.

47
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,541
[TOMOE]
That is of no consequence.

48
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:30,166
Being that we cannot leave the
shrine completely unattended,

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,958
I shall accompany you to Izumo.

50
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,583
The snake can
hold the fort here.

51
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,958
That's quite the plan!

52
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,000
Especially considering that
between the two of us,

53
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,375
I'm the expert on
all things Izumo.

54
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,416
You may be the land
god's familiar,

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
but you've never attended
the Divine Assembly even once,

56
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:44,666
now have you?

57
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,416
[TOMOE grunts]

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,000
He's never been?

59
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,833
With Tomoe's past as a wild fox,
he'd surely be harassed

60
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,666
if he ever went to
the Divine Assembly.

61
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,416
He's spared that disgrace
by playing the housewife.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,958
--[TOMOE grunting]
--[MIZUKI] Oh, Lord Mikage.

63
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,583
--[TOMOE grunting]
--He was so kind and generous.

64
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,625
Wait, the attendees of
the Divine Assembly are

65
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:02,083
all gods though, right?
It doesn't matter how bad

66
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:03,625
you might've been
in the past, Tomoe,

67
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,541
there's no way they
would harass you.

68
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,250
'Cause that would be ungodly!

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,625
Of all the lackadaisical
nonsense you have ever said!

70
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,541
Between us, you would
surely be the one to get

71
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:15,041
--the worst of it in Izumo!
--[NANAMI gasps]

72
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,791
Agreed, you should be more
concerned with yourself, Nanami.

73
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,958
What? Why?

74
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,791
You see, with me by
our mistress's side,

75
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,166
Lady Nanami will carry
a greater air of prestige

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,708
and general
elegance about her.

77
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,083
And avoiding such attention
is the reason that I should be

78
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,583
the one to go with her.
In addition,

79
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,458
I cannot entrust her safety
to an unreliable snake.

80
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,250
You'd have no idea
where you're going!

81
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,500
You'd only slow her down!

82
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,916
You know full well that
you can barely navigate

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,458
your way through
a human crosswalk!

84
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,958
Okay, you two that's enough.
There's no need to fight. Ah!

85
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,208
[NANAMI]
I said stop fighting!

86
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
Violence is prohibited!

87
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:46,666
If we absolutely must
leave one of you at home,

88
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,458
then I'll decide who's
going to go by...

89
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,041
...a game of Shogi!
Winner takes all!

90
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,166
I'm off to go buy my plane
ticket, and the two of you

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,166
better have this sorted
out peacefully by the time

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,750
I get back to the shrine.

93
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,500
[TOMOE] Nanami, there is
no reason for you to have

94
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,708
to fly in a plane when you
have the Night Fog Carriage.

95
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,666
[MIZUKI] Better yet,
my shiki will carry you!

96
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,166
No way.

97
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,666
Those things weren't designed
with human riders in mind,

98
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,458
so I'm gonna go with comfort.

99
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,625
[BOTH grunt]

100
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:17,125
[NANAMI] Jeez, Tomoe and Mizuki
really need to chill out.

101
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,833
Get real, why would a god
care what I do or don't do?

102
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,250
[WOMAN] My apologies for
the wait, Miss Momozono.

103
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,250
As you requested,
one ticket headed for Izumo.

104
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,791
[NANAMI]
Great, thanks!

105
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,750
[MONJIRO] Whoops!

106
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,416
--[NANAMI gasps]
--[MONJIRO] My bad, sorry, lady.

107
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,833
No problem! Ah!

108
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,083
[MONJIRO]
Uh.

109
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,041
[NANAMI]
Weird. He's in a fox mask.

110
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,583
Dude! No friggin' way!

111
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,541
[KIKUICHI] You are making
a racket, Monjiro.

112
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,125
[NANAMI gasps]

113
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,833
[KIKUICHI] Our current mission
is to acquire airplane tickets.

114
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,625
Cease being distracted by the
filthiness surrounding you.

115
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,458
Yeah, I know,
but airplanes are lame!

116
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,458
[KIKUICHI] Perhaps, but that
is what he has asked of us.

117
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,458
[NANAMI]
Talk about a pair of weirdoes.

118
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,666
[MONJIRO] What's so great about
a big, flying hunk of steel?

119
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,583
[NANAMI] Okay, all I gotta do
is stop by the drug store

120
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,458
for a few things,
and I'm set to go.

121
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,750
Oh, I might as well
get snacks, too!

122
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,666
[MAMORU sighs, gasps]

123
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,416
--[MAMORU] Nanami!
--[NANAMI] Ah!

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,958
There's four evil auras.

125
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,541
My spider monkey
sense is tingling!

126
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,125
Like right here, right now?

127
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,291
Yeah, and I don't think they're
feeling very friendly, either!

128
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,750
We've gotta find a safe place,
they're almost on top of us!

129
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,875
Run for it!

130
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,833
[NANAMI]
Run? Where to?

131
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:27,166
[NANAMI gasps]
Tomoe!

132
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,041
Wait, that piece right there.
How did I not see it before?

133
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,791
[MIZUKI chuckles] It looks like
you've finally noticed, Tomoe.

134
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,041
While you were preoccupied
with the movement of my Rook,

135
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,000
I seized the opening
to secretly strike!

136
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,916
My Bishop is primed
for checking your king

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,250
into an early grave, ha!

138
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,291
--[TOMOE] No secret moves!
--[MIZUKI] Ow!

139
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,416
[TOMOE]
We are starting over.

140
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Like you care about
this match anyway.

141
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,375
It's not as if you actually want
to go to Izumo, so why bother?

142
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:54,125
Whether I want to attend or
not is of little consequence

143
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,500
at the moment.

144
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,625
I can't help but
worry, you know.

145
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,708
What if those around
her spoke badly of you?

146
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,125
Nanami wouldn't
be able to bear it.

147
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,875
But I would just laugh it off
as it would serve you right.

148
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,875
You may laugh all you like,
but your concern for Nanami?

149
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:16,625
She has proven she
can handle adversity.

150
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,166
[NANAMI panting]

151
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,750
[MAMORU] Nanami, they're
totally gonna catch us!

152
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,708
[NANAMI] There's no sign of
anyone in the park up ahead!

153
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,916
That's perfect! I'll try to
drive them back there!

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,833
[NANAMI pants]

155
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,250
[gasps]

156
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,166
[NANAMI]
Where did he come from?

157
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,416
Um. Hello.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,958
Nanami, what the heck
are we gonna do?

159
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,000
[NANAMI gasps]

160
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,208
[gasps]

161
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,458
Excuse me, I'm really
sorry about this!

162
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,500
Please don't move, okay?

163
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,791
[NANAMI]
They're here.

164
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,666
Man! You think they brought
enough miasma with them?

165
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,000
Nanami! These guys
are former gods!

166
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,291
Badder than yokai!

167
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,875
[NANAMI]
Former gods?

168
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,291
[MAMORU] That's what they call a
god when it's not holy anymore!

169
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:09,958
[NANAMI]
I'm facing gods?

170
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,958
[FORMER GOD A]
Are you the human?

171
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,875
The one that has been invited
to the Divine Assembly?

172
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,625
I... Yes, I am.

173
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
[FORMER GOD A]
Unforgivable!

174
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,583
I've never seen such gall!
Just a filthy human,

175
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,625
and you dare try to set foot
in the realm of the divine?

176
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,416
You seek too much for yourself.

177
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,750
So decline! Don't bother going!

178
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,500
Do this, and I shall
not disembowel you

179
00:08:28,583 --> 00:08:30,250
right where you stand!

180
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,416
But, technically,
I've been invited

181
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,708
because I'm the Land God
of the Mikage Shrine!

182
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,416
I have to accept!
There's no other choice!

183
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,708
[FORMER GOD C]
The Mikage Shrine?

184
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,708
[FORMER GOD B] The one that
houses that barbaric wild fox.

185
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,000
What did you just say?

186
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,083
[FORMER GOD A] An ignoble
fox serving as a familiar,

187
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,125
what rubbish! As if a mere
dumb beast has any value.

188
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:56,416
[FORMER GODS laugh]

189
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,458
[chuckles]

190
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,041
[FORMER GOD A] Human male,
what is so amusing?

191
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,625
[AKURA-OH]
A bunch of has-beens,

192
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,166
no longer counted among the
gods, reviling a human god.

193
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,041
It's amazing how pathetic
you bastards look when you're

194
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:15,541
laid off. I would've thought
you were all primitive yokai!

195
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,708
[FORMER GOD A]
You shut your mouth!

196
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,041
[NANAMI gasps]

197
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,166
[AKURA-OH grunts]

198
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,708
[FORMER GODS laugh]

199
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,833
[FORMER GOD C] Look! Finally,
a human right where it belongs!

200
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:31,666
[FORMER GODS cackle]

201
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,958
Mamoru, go!

202
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,083
[MAMORU chirps]

203
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,458
Stop! What do you
think you're doing?

204
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,875
Laughing at a man who didn't
stand a chance against you.

205
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,291
It makes me sick to think

206
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,291
you guys could've ever
been called gods!

207
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,750
Trash like you should
be thrown away!

208
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:54,125
So now I'm going to send you
back where you belong!

209
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,083
Barrier against evil!

210
00:09:56,166 --> 00:10:00,125
[FORMER GODS scream]

211
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,541
[gasps]

212
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,375
Are you alright? I'm so sorry.

213
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,166
I didn't mean to get
you mixed up in this.

214
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,375
You're annoying me. Go away.

215
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:16,416
[gasps]

216
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,500
[AKURA-OH]
This is no big deal,

217
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:22,166
just forget about it,
and move on.

218
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,541
[NANAMI]
No, hold on! You're hurt!

219
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,875
[AKURA-OH]
Don't touch me.

220
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,166
But you need help.
Let me get you to a hospital!

221
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,291
[sighs]

222
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,333
[AKURA-OH] I know something
more effective than a hospital.

223
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,916
[gasps]

224
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,666
[NANAMI gasps]

225
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,250
'Kay! You seem fine,
so I'll be on my way, bye!

226
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,458
[NANAMI] Creep.
What was up with him?

227
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,083
[AKURA-OH]
Hmph.

228
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,541
Fickle woman.
Says she wants to help,

229
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:56,083
--but doesn't cooperate.
--[MONJIRO] Master Kirihito!

230
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,041
[MONJIRO] Mission complete!
Airplane tickets acquired!

231
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,000
[KIKUICHI] For your convenience
of preference, master,

232
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,916
we obtained one of each variety,
window and aisle seating!

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,708
[AKURA-OH grunts]

234
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,166
[KIKUICHI] Master Kirihito, how
did you come by those injuries?

235
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,791
Never mind, I'll be all right.

236
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,458
[MONJIRO]
We can't "never mind"!

237
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,416
[KIKUICHI] You have a human
being's body! It requires care!

238
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,583
Enough, you two.

239
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,791
[KIKUICHI, MONJIRO gasp]

240
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,458
[AKURA-OH]
I'm aware it's fragile,

241
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,333
but I won't be tolerating this
condemned existence much longer.

242
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:28,458
I'll regain my original
form without fail.

243
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,416
[KIKUICHI] On that day, this
world will again belong to you.

244
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,708
Once more under the reign
of Master Akura-Oh.

245
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,458
A filthy human that seeks
too much for itself!

246
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,083
And an ignoble fox
serving as a familiar!

247
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,958
[NANAMI]
I can't believe how they acted.

248
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,708
Hey, what's wrong?
You seem kinda down.

249
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,875
[gasps]

250
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,291
If it's what that pervert
did back there,

251
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,375
don't let it get to you.

252
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,125
It's cool, I'm fine.

253
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,208
[NANAMI] I don't care
what they say about me,

254
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:06,291
but no one talks
bad about Tomoe.

255
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:08,166
[NANAMI]
We're back!

256
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,666
[TOMOE]
Behold, Nanami.

257
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,208
I warded off the snake's
expedient tactics to secure

258
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,666
--a brilliant victory.
--[MIZUKI cries]

259
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,625
This settles it! I shall be
accompanying you to Izumo.

260
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:20,916
No matter what may happen,
I shall be there to protect you.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,625
So you may rest easy, Nanami.

262
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,083
--[NANAMI] No.
--[TOMOE] Uh.

263
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,000
Mizuki will be coming
with me to Izumo,

264
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,208
and you're gonna stay here
and hold down the fort.

265
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,875
We all clear?

266
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,875
--[TOMOE] What?
--[MIZUKI] Yay!

267
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,458
[NANAMI] If anything
ever happened to Tomoe,

268
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,000
I would never forgive myself.

269
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,083
[HIMEMIKO] Oh no!
The land god is about to depart

270
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,916
for Izumo and no one else came
to see her on her journey?

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,125
It's okay. You being
here today is all

272
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,958
the encouragement
I need, Himemiko.

273
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,625
[HIMEMIKO] Had I known,
I would have brought

274
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,833
the entire clan with me.
Where art thy familiars?

275
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,000
Mizuki's already gone
ahead on his shiki.

276
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,583
We're gonna meet up
when I get there.

277
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:07,500
How unexpected.
Master Tomoe is to stay at home?

278
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,708
Yeah, Tomoe has to
disguise himself as me

279
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,541
and go to school in
my place while I'm away.

280
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,583
I thought he'd never
stop complaining about it.

281
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,791
Oh! That reminds me.

282
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,041
We recently took something
called a "photograph,"

283
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,625
and I am giving out copies
to all those I consider

284
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
"close friends."

285
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,625
[NANAMI]
Wow, talk about romantic!

286
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:26,791
That's so cute!

287
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,083
We took it the other day,

288
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,625
when Kota and I were
out on a date together.

289
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,375
It looks adorable, does it not?

290
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,750
Seems like things are
going well for you two.

291
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,666
Yes, and 'tis all thanks to you.

292
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,875
No way! You didn't
really need me!

293
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,500
As a yokai, repeatedly
meeting with my beloved Kota

294
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,500
should be impossible. However,
we have the blessings of thee,

295
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,541
the god of matchmaking,
behind our encounters.

296
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,041
And now, thou art about
to present thyself before

297
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,750
the Divine Assembly as well.

298
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,166
The very thought
fills me with pride.

299
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,250
Thou wilt surely make
a difference there, also.

300
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,333
Take care upon thy voyage.

301
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,625
Thank you.

302
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,541
[NANAMI]
I'm off!

303
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,208
Is it just me, or is this
classroom kinda cold?

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,250
[GIRL STUDENT B]
Yeah.

305
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,500
Ah. I can't stop shivering.

306
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,708
Man, the mood in here
is super depressing.

307
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,208
[TOMOE]
Damn you, Nanami.

308
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,250
Passing me over to
go alone with a snake.

309
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,750
And for a whole week at that!

310
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,208
Seven days alone
with a snake.

311
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,958
That bastard once attacked her!

312
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,000
How can she go on a trip
with him so nonchalantly?

313
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,541
[TOMOE]
And until just the other day,

314
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,916
she was blubbering about
having feelings for me.

315
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,958
[TOMOE gasps]

316
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,541
[TOMOE]
Heh. What utter nonsense.

317
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,041
'Tis no matter.

318
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,750
Good morning, my little kittens.

319
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:55,791
[GIRL STUDENTS scream]
Hi, Kurama!

320
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,208
Morning, Nanami.
Just you today?

321
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:01,250
Decided to leave that nagging
fox back at the shrine, huh?

322
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,416
[KURAMA yells]

323
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
[GIRL STUDENT D]
Kurama's face is on fire!

324
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,541
[GIRL STUDENT E] Put it out! Put
it out! Put it out! Put it out!

325
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,166
[NANAMI] I'm really in Izumo,
the land of the gods!

326
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,833
Oh, cool! It's a tourist spot.

327
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,875
[MIZUKI] They don't just
have notable sights.

328
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,083
Freshwater clams!

329
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:18,625
Eel!

330
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,166
Prawns!

331
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,166
Having come all this way, it is
our duty to fill our bellies

332
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,083
with a bounty of
aquatic delicacies!

333
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,666
If there's anything you would
like to know, you just ask.

334
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,416
'Kay, how about
when did you get here?

335
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, just about an hour ago.

336
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,500
Pity! It's unfortunate that we
don't have time for me to show

337
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,916
you around at the moment,

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,583
but you're running late
for the Greeting of the Gods.

339
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,291
"The Greeting of the Gods?"

340
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,833
[MIZUKI]
Mm-hm.

341
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:41,875
The gods are streaming ashore
to meet at the grand shrine.

342
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,875
We had better hurry along if we
wanna make a good impression.

343
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,083
[NARRATOR] The grand shrine
is the annual meeting place

344
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:52,125
of the myriad gods.

345
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,958
It is the highest-ranking
temple in the Province of Izumo.

346
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,166
Oh wow, it's so beautiful.

347
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,916
Your host will be Okuninushi.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,541
So this Okuninushi guy
is the god in charge

349
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,875
of the Divine Assembly?

350
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:08,291
Indeed.

351
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:09,875
[NANAMI]
Wow, to have such a large shrine

352
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
dedicated in his honor.

353
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,666
Makes me wonder what he's like.

354
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:14,791
[MIKAGE]
Oh!

355
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,166
[NANAMI screams]

356
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,333
Nanami!

357
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:19,958
[NANAMI screams]

358
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,625
[NANAMI groaning]

359
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,250
[NANAMI]
Where am I?

360
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,625
Mizuki?

361
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,958
[NANAMI gasps]

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,541
[INAHO] This bothersome
Divine Assembly has begun.

363
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,791
Yet again I am required
to meet face-to-face

364
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,500
with bothersome folk to
discuss bothersome matters.

365
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,291
You need not worry yourself so.

366
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,458
You will be sleeping through

367
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,958
the entire meeting
anyway, Lady Inaho.

368
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,541
[chuckles]

369
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,708
I expect that no one will
arrive late this year.

370
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:02,041
[NANAMI]
These are the myriad gods!

371
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,666
They're amazing!

372
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,583
[TAKEHAYA]
Are you that new human god?

373
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,958
[gasps]

374
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,541
Show me your divine powers.
If you have come to

375
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,750
the Divine Assembly as
living flesh and blood,

376
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,833
I presume you must
have some skills.

377
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,208
Show them to me!

378
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,625
My skills? Sure, uh...

379
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,291
What happened to Mamoru?!

380
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,875
[MAMORU]
Meep!

381
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,125
What is the delay?

382
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,333
Uh! Well, uh...

383
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:29,500
My greatest skill is making
barriers against evil.

384
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,583
Although, it seems my shikigami
is missing right now,

385
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,083
so I can't really
do that at the moment.

386
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,625
But I do have white talismans!

387
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,458
No! My bag!
I don't have anything!

388
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,208
[drum beats]

389
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,416
[FEMALE GOD C]
The drum to gather has sounded.

390
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Let us all make our
way to the banquet hall.

391
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,416
[NANAMI gasps]

392
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,125
[ISA] You will benefit nothing
by spending your time

393
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,291
on the human, Takehaya.
We had best be on our way.

394
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,708
Wait, stop!

395
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:59,416
[TAKEHAYA] Then it is true
what Narukami said.

396
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,708
You are nothing but a mere
human. No talent, and no value.

397
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,833
You are pathetic! You will
stay out of my sight!

398
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:07,875
Ah!

399
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[NANAMI]
It's time to go.

400
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,166
Divine Assembly, here I come.

401
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,208
[MIZUKI] How many times
do I have to tell you?

402
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,916
You must be the stupidest
Guard Bunny ever!

403
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,083
I'm a familiar who came to
the Divine Assembly

404
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,791
to accompany my god! Okay?

405
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,083
[GUARD RABBIT] Familiar though
you may be, I must deny you.

406
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:35,083
Oh! If I don't get inside soon,

407
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,208
I'll stand no chance
of finding Lady Nanami!

408
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:39,083
[GUARD RABBIT] Without the
accompaniment of a god,

409
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,166
you shall not pass
through this torii gate.

410
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,375
You will remain here until
your god comes to fetch you.

411
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,333
--[MIZUKI] Like I said!
--[MAMORU yelling]

412
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,833
My god is still
too inexperienced,

413
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,083
so she has no idea
what she's doing!

414
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,458
[MIZUKI] How could I,
of all people,

415
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,583
have become separated
from Nanami?

416
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:56,208
She's probably all alone
and scared to death!

417
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,875
[GUARD RABBIT] You can
always enter by attaching

418
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,458
yourself to some other god
who happens to arrive late.

419
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,208
Do you know how big of an
airhead a god would have to be

420
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,250
to turn up late for
a once a year show?

421
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,750
Guard rabbit, I'm so late!
Please open the gate!

422
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,083
My skin was just not
cooperating today,

423
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,750
and my make-up took
me forever to do!

424
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,583
Oh, my, Mizuki.
This is all terribly sudden.

425
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,666
So not having fun.

426
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,833
[NANAMI] I have no clue
which path is the right way.

427
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,750
Where did the gods go?

428
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,666
No matter how far I walk,
everything looks the same.

429
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,750
I'm alone, and without Mizuki,

430
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,625
I can't even get
to the meeting hall,

431
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,291
never mind the Divine Assembly!

432
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,750
I am pathetic.

433
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,583
The flame is going out! No!

434
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,500
[NANAMI gasps]

435
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:52,250
[NANAMI]
Some-Someone?

436
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,791
[NANAMI]
Is anyone there?

437
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:01,041
[NANAMI]
Please, anybody?

438
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,666
[MIKAGE]
Have you become lost?

439
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,541
[NANAMI gasps]

440
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,208
[MIKAGE] Come with me.
Let me show you the way.

441
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,333
[NANAMI]
Who is this?

442
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,416
[MIKAGE] We've made it.
Beyond these doors is

443
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,208
the chamber of
the Divine Assembly.

444
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,000
And you, aren't you attending
the meeting as well?

445
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,833
[MIKAGE]
No, that I am not.

446
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,333
[MIKAGE]
Are you afraid, miss human god?

447
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,500
[NANAMI] The other gods
are amazing, and I'm not.

448
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,000
Why am I even here?

449
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,000
[MIKAGE]
No god is truly omnipotent.

450
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:54,625
They each have strengths
and weaknesses.

451
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,041
As well as their
own roles to play.

452
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,333
[NANAMI]
Their own roles?

453
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,666
[MIKAGE]
Lady Inaho is not industrious,

454
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,958
and while the Three Fumigae
Gods are well learned,

455
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,541
they have poor penmanship.

456
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,916
The War God is foreboding and
aggressive, but he can't sing.

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,500
[NANAMI]
Huh!

458
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,708
[MIKAGE] For every shortcoming
is a virtue, the same as you.

459
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:15,750
[gasps]

460
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,041
[MIKAGE]
Of all the myriad gods,

461
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,208
you alone can see
through the eyes of man.

462
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,250
You can sympathize with
humans, sit next to them,

463
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,625
and put your arm
around their shoulders.

464
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:28,500
That is your strength,
and so you are amazing.

465
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,833
Enter these doors, and you
will see for yourself.

466
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,500
Proudly speak your mind.

467
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,125
You are a participant
of the Divine Assembly.

468
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,208
It is your right.

469
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:41,333
I will! Thank you
for everything.

470
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,541
Oh! Don't go!
At least tell me your name!

471
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,708
[gasps]

472
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,125
[inhales, exhales]

473
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,916
[NANAMI]
Once I walk through these doors,

474
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,791
I'm gonna show them
what I'm made of.

475
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,541
Please excuse my tardiness.

476
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,916
I'm here now.

477
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,375
From Mikage Shrine,
the land god Nanami Momozono.

478
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,500
[OKUNINUSHI]
Ah, that is the human god

479
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,500
Otohiko recommends most highly.

480
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,833
Now I see. Her eyes
are so beautifully pure.

481
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:35,041
I choose you, dear little
Nanami Momozono.

482
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:49,166
[NARRATOR] Here we are
at the Divine Assembly,

483
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,625
and every which way,
they're gods!

484
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,125
Here's a god! There's a god?

485
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,375
And the host is the
imposing Okuninushi.

486
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,458
Meanwhile, staying at home,
Tomoe attends school.

487
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:58,333
Wowzers is he
ever in a bad mood.

488
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,708
Next time, "The God Falls
into the Netherworld."

489
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,083
Slip to hell.
