1
00:00:08,625 --> 00:00:11,291
Could this be a nymph?

2
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:12,583
Um, hi.

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:15,500
[gasps, growls]
Who might you be?

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:18,208
What makes you think you can set
foot upon this sacred land

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,291
where all women are
forbidden to tread?

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,208
[NANAMI]
Women are forbidden?

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:27,166
Maybe that's why
he looks so angry.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,166
I'm so sorry! I had no idea
I wasn't allowed here.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,625
I'll just get out
of your hair now!

10
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,833
--[JIRO] Stop!
--[NANAMI yelps]

11
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,333
Are you the one who made
these cherry blossoms bloom?

12
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,583
What is your name,
and why have you come here?

13
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:39,833
[cries]

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,541
Answer my questions, woman!

15
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,541
Your response shall determine
if I break your arm.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,500
Master Jiro!

17
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,500
[NANAMI gasps]
Wait, Jiro?

18
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,000
That means this guy is the
creep who hurt Botanmaru!

19
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,083
[MAMORU chirps]

20
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,000
[JIRO grunts]

21
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,791
[NANAMI pants]

22
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,625
[JIRO winces]
Stop.

23
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,125
[COMMON TENGU]
There you are, Master Jiro.

24
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,750
I was looking for you.

25
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:48,833
You are needed back at the hall,
sir. Is something the matter?

26
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:56,958
I'm merely surprised that a
woman's arm can be so frail.

27
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,416
[NANAMI panting]
What's his problem?

28
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,250
That guy's got
serious anger issues.

29
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,250
But do you really think
that Brother Jiro

30
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,500
becoming the fourth successor

31
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,416
will make everything
better on the mountain?

32
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,666
[NANAMI] There's no way that
jerk could fix anything!

33
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,833
[TOMOE] I was beginning to
worry you had fallen in.

34
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,333
So does "go to the bathroom"
actually mean waste your time?

35
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,750
Tomoe!

36
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:26,416
[NANAMI cries]

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,583
What is wrong?

38
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,750
Why are you trembling?
Tell me what happened.

39
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:35,916
[NANAMI]
Trembling? I am?

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,083
No wonder. I feel like
I'm about to collapse.

41
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,791
You encountered Jiro?
Are you all right?

42
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
Poor thing, I hope
he did not hurt you.

43
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,541
[NANAMI] Uh, actually,
I'm the one who met him.

44
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,083
I'm okay, but he did
threaten to break my arm.

45
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,041
I wish I had known
women weren't allowed

46
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,416
on this mountain, though.
I probably wouldn't have gone

47
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,333
walking all over
the place like that.

48
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,208
What a relief nothing
important happened!

49
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,083
[TOMOE slurps]

50
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,333
[NANAMI
'Nothing important"?

51
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,708
I must say, I had heard
tales of his violence;

52
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,333
however, I never really expected
Jiro to be such a brute.

53
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,458
Raising a fist in anger has
always been his first response.

54
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,125
Truly, I should
have known better.

55
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,333
I shall make it up to you by
having a new bathroom prepared.

56
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:17,416
Uh! Stop acting like
I'm not here! Look at me!

57
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,375
[NANAMI gasps]

58
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,416
[SUIRO gasps]

59
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,791
I beg of you, please
do not resent me.

60
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,708
I have lived with this
mountain's customs a long time.

61
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,458
Thus, I am not comfortable
interacting with women.

62
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,500
Especially when faced
with a beautiful maiden,

63
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,500
such as yourself.

64
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,750
[NANAMI]
Why do I get the feeling

65
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,458
pretty boy doesn't mean
that as a compliment?

66
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,000
So that's why you didn't
let me use your bathroom?

67
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,208
No, it is because the toilet
here lacks plumbing,

68
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,125
and a woman's "business"
should be like her cheeks,

69
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,166
always flushed.

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,333
[KURAMA]
Great dinner topic.

71
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,291
On the subject of
doing our "business",

72
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,875
there's something
we need to discuss.

73
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,583
Something that's left over.

74
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,875
Oh? But it would appear
you cleaned your dish,

75
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,541
including the
pickled vegetables.

76
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,875
I am glad to see that your
tastes have finally matured.

77
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,500
How could he not? These
pickled veggies are delish!

78
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,916
I didn't mean leftovers
literally, guys.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,958
I'm talking about my father's
sickness here; we need to focus.

80
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,541
These are Peach Pills.

81
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,083
Nanami got this miracle cure-all
straight from the Medicine God

82
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,333
when she was in Izumo.

83
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,875
They're our best bet
for curing the old man.

84
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Have him throw back a few of
these bad boys and we're set.

85
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,666
Once he's in full health,

86
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
the mountain should go back
to the way it was, too.

87
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,416
And Jiro's succession will
have come to screeching halt.

88
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,000
If they are what you claim,
I do not doubt their potency.

89
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:29,791
Even against an illness
as grave as the Sojobo's.

90
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,291
Be that as it may,

91
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,458
administering this medicine
to him would be impossible.

92
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,666
[SUIRO] The Sojobo collapsed
about two months ago.

93
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,000
Since then, he has
been hidden away

94
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,750
in some sanctum
on the compound.

95
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother Jiro maintains
all official duties

96
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:49,458
as Master of the Hall, including
keeping security tight.

97
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,541
No outsiders are
permitted within.

98
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,916
And due to my banishment,
that includes me as well.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,541
Entrusting the medicine to
an insider is an option,

100
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:00,333
but even then it is unlikely
to reach its intended mark.

101
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:03,208
Jiro would be quick to
stop such an operation.

102
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,291
[JIRO grunts]

103
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,333
[NANAMI]
He would do something like that.

104
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,833
[KURAMA grunts]

105
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,208
[SUIRO] But you should not
brood about this too much.

106
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,541
These things always have a way
of working themselves out.

107
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:13,458
Why not enjoy some fresh apples?

108
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,458
[KURAMA] What, you're just fine
with things staying like this?!

109
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,875
Don't worry about Brother Jiro;
I'll handle him.

110
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,833
He's not going to stop me
from seeing my father!

111
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,333
That is far too dangerous.

112
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,833
I cannot allow you
to risk your own safety.

113
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,208
Can't allow me?

114
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,958
I'm not a little kid anymore.

115
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,041
The only reason I came here
is because I thought there'd

116
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,000
be something I could do
other than running away.

117
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:37,083
I'm not who I used to be.

118
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,541
[NANAMI]
Kurama.

119
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,083
No. This is still
beyond your ability.

120
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,541
Uh! But why?

121
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,833
[INSTRUCTOR]
Shinjuro!

122
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,958
[ALL]
Huh?!

123
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,166
I'm so glad you
finally came home!

124
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,583
And you're all
grown up now, too!

125
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,708
Uh... Who are you?

126
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,500
It's me!

127
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,916
[KURAMA]
Oh.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,833
I'm sorry, Shinjuro! When
I told him you were back,

129
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,875
he just couldn't
wait to see you!

130
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,708
[GREAT BROTHERS]
Shinjuro! Shinjuro!

131
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,625
[INSTRUCTOR] Shinjuro has
at last returned to succeed

132
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,083
his father as the fourth Sojobo!
What a wonderful day!

133
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,291
Uh. Hold on.

134
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,166
I think you've got
the wrong idea.

135
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,208
[INSTRUCTOR] The Sojobo
is an elderly man.

136
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,625
[GREAT BROTHER A] Even if
he pulls through today,

137
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,041
who knows what
tomorrow shall bring?

138
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,333
[GREAT BROTHER B]
Finding a suitable successor

139
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,875
is of the utmost importance!

140
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,708
[KURAMA]
Uh! Uh...

141
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,541
Shinjuro, this is for
the sake of the mountain.

142
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:28,958
Surely, you would not
abandon us again.

143
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,125
--[GREAT BROTHERS talking]
--[KURAMA] Uh? Succeed?

144
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,458
--[GREAT BROTHERS talking]
--But I don't want to.

145
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,583
[KURAMA gasps]

146
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,166
[GREAT BROTHER B]
Yes, you must have!

147
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,666
[INSTRUCTOR] Shinjuro, you are
the only one who can rightfully

148
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,416
fill the void that will be left
in your father's passing!

149
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,875
[clap, clap]

150
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,666
[SUIRO] That is quite enough
for today, great brothers.

151
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,458
Shinjuro has just returned
home after being away,

152
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,875
and he is tired. Let us discuss
these intricate matters later.

153
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,375
--[INSTRUCTOR] Right.
--[GREAT BROTHER B] Mm.

154
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,416
[GREAT BROTHER A]
Yes, of course.

155
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,333
[SUIRO]
'Tis alright.

156
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:01,208
You should not let their
words weigh on your mind.

157
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[SUIRO gasps]

158
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,375
Where are you going?

159
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,916
[KURAMA]
Please excuse me, everyone.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,041
I think I need a moment
to clear my head.

161
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,250
Do you think Kurama
will be okay?

162
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,041
[TOMOE] Hard to say, it seems
he has no desire to be the heir.

163
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:19,500
Not surprising. After seventeen
years in the mundane world,

164
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,666
why would he
wish to return?

165
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,333
Lady land god, I ask you,

166
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:27,500
if I deliver the peach
pills to the Sojobo,

167
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,000
would you please do
me a favor in return?

168
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,750
Take Shinjuro and descend the
mountain tomorrow morning.

169
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,583
You need not become
involved in our affairs.

170
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,375
Too bad, because we're
already involved.

171
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,958
We're here to support Ku-, to
support Shinjuro however we can.

172
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,958
So we're not leaving until
he says so. Understand?

173
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:49,458
[SUIRO chuckles]

174
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,666
When I reunited with
Shinjuro at the main gate,

175
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,708
imagine my surprise to see
that he brought a woman.

176
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:59,958
I realized then, he is no
longer the child I once knew.

177
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:03,000
He has grown so much while
away from this mountain.

178
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,208
And has surely left
behind an entire life

179
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,708
in the mundane world.
One that he cannot abandon.

180
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,875
That is why expecting
him to become

181
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,416
part of the mountain
is not fair.

182
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,833
Tell me, lady land god.
Do you truly know Shinjuro?

183
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:20,208
[NANAMI gasps]

184
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,500
[SUIRO] He has always
faced his challenges alone.

185
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,875
Even if they overwhelm him,
he will recklessly push himself,

186
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,833
for he could never exploit
another's kindness.

187
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:32,208
I have known Shinjuro ever
since he was a small child,

188
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,000
and yet, he has never
come to me for help once.

189
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,666
But I did what I could.

190
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,750
I continued to watch
over him in hopes

191
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:42,416
that he would let me shoulder
his heaviest burdens for him.

192
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Please, take him home.

193
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,583
Before he takes on the burden of
becoming the fourth successor.

194
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,250
[TOMOE]
You could never pull it off.

195
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,666
Uh?!

196
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,000
If you are incapable of
determining someone is behind

197
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,041
you prior to them outright
breaking silence,

198
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:02,750
then you stand no chance of
sneaking into that compound.

199
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,875
It's funny you say that,

200
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:07,125
I was actually thinking
the same thing.

201
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,541
Even from all the way out here,

202
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,625
the great hall feels
domineering.

203
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:12,833
They've doubled their
triple layer barriers;

204
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:15,916
talk about overkill.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,791
Let me guess, Suiro wants
you to take me home, right?

206
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,291
[TOMOE]
Yes.

207
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,583
I tried to talk a big game,
but when ya get down to it,

208
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,708
I don't have a clue
what I'm doing here.

209
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,875
And Suiro completely
called my bluff.

210
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,750
I feel so humiliated
I could die.

211
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:34,541
[TOMOE] What do you want
to do? This is your call.

212
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,333
[NANAMI panting]
Kurama!

213
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,125
[KURAMA yelps]

214
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
Well? C'mon, what's our plan?

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,958
[KURAMA]
Uh?

216
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,000
I wanna sneak into
that compound,

217
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,291
and give my old man
the medicine personally.

218
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:55,291
Would you maybe
help me do that?

219
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,333
[wind howls]

220
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,125
Huh? What did you say?

221
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,083
I couldn't hear you because
the wind was so loud.

222
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:01,250
One more time?

223
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,208
What? Uh, nothing!
I didn't say anything!

224
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,958
[NANAMI]
Hey Tomoe, you heard him right?

225
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,458
What did he say?

226
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,333
[TOMOE]
He asked for our help.

227
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,208
Of all the stupid questions!
Of course we'll help you!

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,416
[FUMIMARU]
Brother! Please!

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,291
Just one more chance!

230
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,208
I am sorry, Fumimaru.
As decreed by Master Jiro,

231
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,291
we cannot accommodate feeble
tengu at the hall any longer.

232
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,666
[FUMIMARU whimpers]

233
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,875
[BROTHER TENGU] Whether your
future is in the woods

234
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,750
or down the mountain
is for you to decide.

235
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,000
[door slams]

236
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,166
[CHIYOMARU] First, Brother Usa,
and now Brother Fumi.

237
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,083
He was so kind, too. [sniffles]

238
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,583
Don't cry, Chiyomaru.

239
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,750
You won't be far behind him
if they catch you like this;

240
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,833
then what'll you do?

241
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,375
Although, it probably
doesn't matter,

242
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,333
we'll all get kicked
out eventually.

243
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,208
I wish things would go
back to the way they were

244
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,833
before The Third got sick.

245
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:57,250
Don't say that! I'm gonna get
banished, I just know it!

246
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,916
[DAIDAIMARU]
It'll be okay, brothers.

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,166
[CHIYOMARU, TAKEMARU]
Hm?

248
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,083
The Third will get better
again in no time.

249
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,500
That's what our celestial nymph
sister said; so it'll be okay.

250
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,583
[DAIDAIMARU]
Our sister!

251
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,125
She made the eternal
cherry blossom tree bloom!

252
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
So pretty and warm.

253
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,583
Just thinking about her
makes me start to smile.

254
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,333
And then I don't
feel sad anymore.

255
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,625
I feel warm instead!

256
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,375
[YATORI]
Hello, Master Jiro.

257
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,000
I heard you had another tengu
kid leave the nest today.

258
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,875
The way they're flying the coup,
there won't be anybody left.

259
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,750
So be it. Those who
are weak of spirit,

260
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,041
or lack strength, are not
welcome in my compound.

261
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:39,125
I must make sure only the
strongest shall live here.

262
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:42,166
Though what concerns me more
is your presence here tonight.

263
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,291
How did you get
past my barriers?

264
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,000
[YATORI] Oh, yeah, there
were barriers, weren't there?

265
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:51,000
Thing is, they're full of holes.
I must admit, I expected better.

266
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,875
A barrier's only as strong as
the heart and mind of its maker.

267
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,500
Perhaps your heart and mind
are in disarray, Master Jiro.

268
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,541
[JIRO grunts]

269
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,166
Whoa! Now that's more like it!

270
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,375
There's no way I could
get around this one!

271
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,625
[YATORI groans]

272
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,750
You dare imply my heart
and mind bear weakness?

273
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,916
[YATORI muffled]
That's crazy! I'd never do that!

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,291
No, you would not!

275
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,750
Be gone.

276
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,833
My spirit is as strong as steel.

277
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:23,125
I will never waver
in my convictions.

278
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:26,250
Curse that woman.
This was her doing.

279
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,541
[JIRO]
I have to know who she is.

280
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,791
You must be joking.

281
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,291
Hey, I'm not stoked
about sharing

282
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,875
a room with you either, okay?

283
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,250
Suiro knows you're my familiar,

284
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,083
and he's trying to
be accommodating.

285
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,750
And why are you
being such a baby?

286
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,166
It could be worse.

287
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,166
I can't even change
my clothes in here.

288
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,166
So it's really not that
bad for you, is it?

289
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,708
[bed squeaks]

290
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,666
Good grief. That certainly
was a close one.

291
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,916
[NANAMI]
Oh, yeah,

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,458
because you're totally
the one in danger here!

293
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,250
Speaking of, I'm
wearing lots of layers

294
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,958
so you can't jump
me like last time!

295
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,291
Good plan. Barring the fact
that when you are asleep,

296
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,833
your shirt often lifts up
and exposes your torso.

297
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,333
[NANAMI gasps] You were takin'
in the sights, weren't you?

298
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,458
Peeping has never
been my intention.

299
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,083
In truth, keeping you where
I can watch over you

300
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,458
is all I have ever cared about.

301
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,708
Huh?

302
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,583
You may rest easily.

303
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,375
For even if your clothes
come clean off,

304
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,000
my heart and mind shall
remain entirely pure.

305
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:27,375
[NANAMI] You're such a big,
stupid jerk! Ah!

306
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,000
[KURAMA]
You guys still awake?

307
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,750
Brother Suiro gave me a
map of the whole compound.

308
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,750
Tomorrow is the day
we're sneaking in.

309
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

310
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,375
[KURAMA] A powerful barrier
surrounds the facility.

311
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,416
We don't stand a chance
of getting past it,

312
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,208
unless we're invited
in as guests.

313
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,750
There are probably a few more
barriers we'll have to find

314
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,375
our way around once we
get inside the place, too.

315
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,208
As Master of the Hall,
Jiro is in charge of defense.

316
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,458
That won't be a problem, though,

317
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,958
'cause we're gonna
divide and conquer.

318
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,125
Here's how it goes.

319
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,291
Team one gets Jiro
drunk with this liquor.

320
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,000
Meanwhile, team two
goes to find my father.

321
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,750
Would it not be easier for us
to dispose of Jiro altogether?

322
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,791
Maybe, but I don't
want anybody

323
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
inside the compound
getting hurt.

324
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,166
The real question is, how
do we get them to welcome

325
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,916
us past the first barrier
and not arouse suspicion?

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,291
Uh. Pardon.
Master Shinjuro?

327
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,041
What the-? Why are
you still here, Botanmaru?

328
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,375
I am sorry to interrupt you,
but please let me help!

329
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,250
I wish to heal the Sojobo!

330
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,916
[NANAMI]
Botanmaru.

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,583
No way. You need to stay
here with Brother Suiro.

332
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,208
If something goes
wrong out there,

333
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,166
I won't be able to save you.

334
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,250
Hold on a sec. If we're
splitting into two groups,

335
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,041
it'd be better for us
to have more people.

336
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,708
So, we need to decide on
who's dealing with Jiro,

337
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,666
and who's searching
for the old man.

338
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
Of course. Being that
I am her familiar,

339
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,666
I shall go with Nanami
and search the compound

340
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,000
for the Sojobo, which
leaves you free to handle

341
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,583
the Jiro problem
all by yourself.

342
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,041
Wait, what?
That's one plan.

343
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,458
But why don't we explore some of
our other options first, okay?

344
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:59,208
Jiro would recognize Nanami,
she cannot make the attempt.

345
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,708
Master Shinjuro! I would
gladly accompany you, sir!

346
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,208
I already told you no!

347
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,208
[BOTANMARU whines]

348
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:06,708
[NANAMI]
Hang in there, Botanmaru!

349
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,083
[KURAMA]
You stupid fox!

350
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,833
[TOMOE] Dealing with a tengu
should be a tengu's job!

351
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,333
Consider Nanami's foolishness.

352
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,666
She is entirely incapable
without me by her side.

353
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,791
[NANAMI] Shut up!
I'm a strong, independent woman,

354
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,458
and I don't need you
watching over me!

355
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,583
[NANAMI]
How 'bout this.

356
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,416
I will go look for
Mister Sojobo,

357
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,791
and I'll take Botanmaru with me.

358
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:28,250
And then the two of you can
keep Jiro distracted, okay?

359
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,625
You've gotta be joking!

360
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,791
I'm not!

361
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't worry!
I just had a brilliant idea!

362
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:35,750
It's a sure fire plan to get
us invited past the barrier!

363
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,875
--[TOMOE, KURAMA] Uh...
--[NANAMI giggles]

364
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,791
[TOMOE] Nanami's foolishness
knows no bounds.

365
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,333
This plan of hers
is absolutely absurd.

366
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,250
I should have known
she was up to something.

367
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,041
She never says
anything intelligent

368
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,291
when that grin is on her face.

369
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,875
[TOMOE]
And so it begins.

370
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,333
[NANAMI grunts]

371
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,375
[TOMOE]
Such a pill of a girl.

372
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,291
What is it about her
that captivates me?

373
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:15,916
[NANAMI]
Potty.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,041
[TOMOE]
Uh!

375
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,250
[NANAMI]
Gotta. Potty.

376
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,875
[NANAMI groans]

377
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,375
[TOMOE]
That girl, I swear.

378
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:28,416
And after all of the trembling
she did earlier.

379
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,958
I can go with Botanmaru to
search for Mister Sojobo,

380
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,041
but the rest is up to you!

381
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,875
You'd better not try to take
advantage of me tonight

382
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,416
while I'm trying to
get my beauty sleep!

383
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,958
Oh, please.

384
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,041
[TOMOE]
Damn.

385
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,750
Why will she not just accept
my protection of her?

386
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:51,583
How does she not realize?
I am unable to do anything else.

387
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,708
[TOMOE gasps]

388
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:03,166
Hey! Your futon is
on the other side!

389
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,833
[TOMOE] Keeping you where
I can watch over you

390
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,500
is all I have ever cared about.

391
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,916
[TOMOE gasps]

392
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,833
[NANAMI gasps]

393
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,208
[TOMOE]
So you may rest easily.

394
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,208
For my heart and mind.

395
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,416
Were supposed to remain
entirely pure.

396
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:43,833
Uh, Tomoe. What are
you doing in my futon?

397
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:44,708
[TOMOE]
I am not.

398
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,500
Your futon is over there.

399
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,250
Huh?! Oh, sorry about that!

400
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,750
[gasps] That was way
too close for comfort!

401
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,875
[NANAMI groans]

402
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,916
[NANAMI] Then again, why
do I have this feeling,

403
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
like he was holding
me tight in his arms?

404
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,791
Was I dreaming?

405
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,541
Or was it...

406
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,541
[KURAMA] I had no idea
you were so negligent.

407
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,916
It's your duty as my familiar
to help me get ready,

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,291
and yet you're only just
now crawling out of bed.

409
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,291
Look at you! Totally godlike,
but still a bad boy at heart!

410
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,416
[KURAMA]
Well, of course!

411
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
After seventeen years,
a runaway tengu,

412
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,000
having become a land god,
finally returns home;

413
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,416
a story like that requires
production value if we want

414
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,750
anyone to believe it.

415
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,791
Even the surrogate
leader Jiro can't ignore

416
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,541
an exiled brother tengu who
has ascended to godhood.

417
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,208
He'll have no choice
but to welcome us

418
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,375
as supremely honored guests!

419
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:47,166
Onwards! To the
Kurama main hall!

420
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,708
But before we go,

421
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,625
I think a test of my newfound
land god powers is in order.

422
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,958
What do you think, fox?

423
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,208
If you do not value your life,
then by all means,

424
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,375
give them a try.

425
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,083
By my word, I order you
to act like a cat,

426
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,916
spin around in place,
and give a hearty "meow!"

427
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,333
Meow!

428
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,333
[gasps]

429
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,000
Holy crap!
This talisman is awesome!

430
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,583
I have complete control
of Sacred Word Binding!

431
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,375
Kurama! Keep that talisman
hidden in your clothes.

432
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,916
Now both of you quit
fooling around,

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,333
it's time to get serious.

434
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,083
[TOMOE] It appears you
need to "get serious."

435
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,458
What the hell are you wearing?

436
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,916
This is my disguise!

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,500
Jeez, I have to at least try
and not look like a girl.

438
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,000
[TOMOE]
I hate this plan.

439
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,083
Because of you, I must be
subjected to the tengu's wrath.

440
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,666
Hey, while we have
a moment alone.

441
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,583
About yesterday...

442
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,500
It was dark,
and I was half asleep,

443
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,500
so I know I could be wrong,
but were you holding me in

444
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,625
your arms while I was sleeping
next to you last night?

445
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,625
Just wondering, I know you
said you don't think of me...

446
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,875
No, sorry. I was also
half asleep at the time.

447
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,375
I mistook yours for the warmth
of my friend Tanuko.

448
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,333
I was having a pleasant dream
of spending an evening

449
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,541
with her at the tea house.

450
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,041
However, as soon
as I touched you,

451
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,750
I realized you were not the lady
of my desire, and I awoke.

452
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,416
I apologize for my inappropriate
actions last night.

453
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,125
It was purely by accident.
Can you forgive me? Please?

454
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,041
[NANAMI]
Mm-hm.

455
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,000
[TOMOE]
Great.

456
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,458
[TOMOE]
Ugh.

457
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:09,791
Well that was awkward.

458
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you need to
take a cold shower?

459
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,875
Or are you ready to go?

460
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,333
[COMMON TENGU B]
Brother!

461
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,916
A party claiming to be
Shinjuro has come calling.

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,416
[BROTHER TENGU B]
"Shinjuro," you say?

463
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,833
We are not expecting such a
guest. Do not open the gate.

464
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,916
Turn them away!

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,291
If you think we should.

466
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,583
--[blast]
--[gasps]

467
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,041
I appreciate the welcome,
common tengu.

468
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,541
I am Shinjuro, the eldest
son of Sojobo the Third.

469
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,208
As land god of
the Mikage Shrine,

470
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,666
I have come to witness the
fourth's rite of succession.

471
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,541
Now, where may I find Jiro?

472
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,750
[COMMON TENGUS murmur]

473
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,500
[TOMOE] What is the matter,
lowly tengus?

474
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,541
My lord and master
has a short temper.

475
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,375
If you do not wish to
be reduced to ashes,

476
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,208
along with your
hall, get moving.

477
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,166
[JIRO] It appears Suiro's
letter was in good faith.

478
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:01,125
If a god has come calling,
then we have no choice

479
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,500
but to welcome him.
Please make your way inside.

480
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,333
[NANAMI] All right!
So far, so good.

481
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,416
This is our chance
to find the Sojobo.

482
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,208
You can lead the way, Botanmaru!

483
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,958
[BOTANMARU]
Ah...

484
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,000
[NANAMI]
Come on, let's go!

485
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:29,083
[NANAMI] Layers of barriers are
woven all across this compound.

486
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,750
And somewhere within
this maze is The Third.

487
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,333
We have to find him!

488
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,166
[NARRATOR]
Kurama and Tomoe have managed

489
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,583
to infiltrate the front gate!
Let the drinks flow,

490
00:23:51,666 --> 00:23:53,875
and the good times roll!
Oh, wait, they get caught.

491
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,791
Meanwhile, Nanami and
Botanmaru find the Sojobo!

492
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:58,291
But something's not quite right.

493
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:00,583
Next time,
"The God Is Blindsided."

494
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:01,916
They're so doomed!
