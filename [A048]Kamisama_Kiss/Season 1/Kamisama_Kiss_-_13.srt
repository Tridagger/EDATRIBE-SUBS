1
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,708
I'm not important.

2
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:12,958
I'm not needed.

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm a failure.

4
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,458
Nanami!

5
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,291
Where are you?

6
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,416
Where could you be?

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,416
Nanami!

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,416
Hang in there, Master Mizuki!

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,541
What is that supposed to mean?

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,750
All I'm doing is
throwing sake around.

11
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:56,500
Here I am again.

12
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,250
Nowhere to go.

13
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,125
Oh!

14
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,375
I guess since you're making me
do all the hard work that means

15
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,625
you just get to lounge
around on the roof.

16
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,500
Fox-fires, find Nanami!

17
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,250
Nanami?

18
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,791
You mean she's gone?

19
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,000
Wait for me!

20
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,500
I'm coming too!

21
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,458
But Master Mizuki, what about
the miasma at the shrine?

22
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,833
Here you go!

23
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:27,958
What?

24
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,458
Do what you can with that!

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:32,291
It is impossible!

26
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,625
We cannot do anything!

27
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,708
Oh no!

28
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,833
It is headed toward us!

29
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:38,458
Back off!

30
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,208
Go away; go away!

31
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,875
Wow!

32
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:46,708
Oh my--Both familiars
have abandoned their posts.

33
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,750
But what about that miasma?

34
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,791
Well, I could
easily retrieve it.

35
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:54,250
However, I think I'd rather
just wait and see how things go.

36
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:59,166
Aren't I the
sweetest wind god ever?

37
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:10,958
You know I did; you know I did!

38
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,333
Nanami!

39
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:14,916
Nanami!

40
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,125
Nanami, are you in here?

41
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,125
Nanami!

42
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,583
Master Tomoe!

43
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:28,708
We have searched everywhere,

44
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,250
but we cannot find
Lady Nanami at all!

45
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,708
We cannot even sense her.

46
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,750
I saw no signs of her
out by the river, either.

47
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:37,916
Um, yeah, so I didn't see her
over by the station, guys.

48
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,125
We shall continue
to search for her!

49
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,166
Tomoe.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,083
I'm going into town.

51
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,625
Tomoe's finally back at school!

52
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,833
He's dressed like all
traditional, too!

53
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:11,916
What's the matter, fox?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,750
You stressed out
because you're so late?

55
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,958
Nice outfit.

56
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,125
Well, for someone
with no fashion sense.

57
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,291
What the hell was that, fox?

58
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:28,000
No one is allowed to ignore me!

59
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,125
Hey, pervert,
this is the girls room.

60
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,250
You can't go in there--

61
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,708
Nanami.

62
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,208
Hey!

63
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,375
What's going on?

64
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,625
I know hostile is your thing,

65
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,916
but this is a bit
much even for you.

66
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,916
Did something happen to Nanami?

67
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,458
This matter is none
of your business.

68
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:55,541
Hey, Kurama, have you,
by chance, seen Nanami?

69
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,416
We can't find here anywhere.

70
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,500
Sorry; didn't see you there.

71
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,333
Just go.

72
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,500
Okay.

73
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,041
Why do you always
have to be so violent?

74
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,875
Interesting.

75
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,166
Nanami has disappeared.

76
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,833
Since we can't find her after
all the searching we've done,

77
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:21,291
do you think that maybe
she's left town or something?

78
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,666
No, she has used a talisman.

79
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,458
Please tell me
you have found her.

80
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,500
I've got nothing.

81
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,375
Literally.

82
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,708
I'm running on empty over here.

83
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,000
I am, as well.

84
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,166
Oh, Lady Nanami.

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,416
Where in the world
could you be?

86
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:58,208
Why do I always end up alone?

87
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,541
I'll just go back
to square one!

88
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,333
I mean, me be a god?

89
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,333
Back to square one.

90
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,041
Someone help!

91
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,208
Please, you've gotta help me!

92
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,875
Can you please get
that dog out of here!

93
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:39,208
I can give you my home.

94
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,833
I don't mind.

95
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:43,916
You are more worthy
of that house than I am.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,166
Where have you been?

97
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,125
Gone for twenty years?

98
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,500
What could a pathetic
looking thing like her do?

99
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,250
At the most, she might be able
to count the money offerings.

100
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:58,333
I could not care less if
the shrine goes to ruin.

101
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,208
You're so selfish.

102
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,166
That shrine is your home!

103
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm so excited about
the festival this weekend!

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,458
What's the name of
that shrine again?

105
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,500
The Mikage Shrine.

106
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,916
Sounds cool.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,416
We should ask Hide and Suzuki
if they wanna go, too!

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,041
Totally!

109
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,208
I bet they will!

110
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:24,750
I so can't wait!

111
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,916
Me either!

112
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,750
What am I doing?

113
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,791
Running away?

114
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,625
That place is my home.

115
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,166
The shrine is my home.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,500
I have to protect it!

117
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
Lady Nanami.

118
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,958
Lady Nanami!

119
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,166
There she is!

120
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,666
We found her!

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,458
I have to protect the shrine.

122
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,250
At the very least, I can try!

123
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,625
I know I may not succeed,
but only I can do it.

124
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:37,791
Only me.

125
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,458
I have to do what I
can to save my home!

126
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,250
That is from the
treasure storehouse.

127
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,291
What is this giant miasma?

128
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh no!

129
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,083
I dropped the sacred sake!

130
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,875
What is happening?

131
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,750
It looks as though it is drawing
in the rest of the miasma!

132
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:25,083
Please do not be
what I think it is!

133
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:25,875
Why?

134
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,625
What do you think it is?

135
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,375
Hold on.

136
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,083
What's happening?

137
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,708
It's a gigantic miasma!

138
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,375
That thing is so
not what I released!

139
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:33,916
Mayday!

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,916
Mayday!

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,125
Return, miasma!

142
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,083
Return to this tiny bottle!

143
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,458
The miasma.

144
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,875
Look how big it's grown!

145
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,000
Master Tomoe!

146
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,833
We have found Lady Nanami!

147
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,166
Where is she?

148
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,708
Sir, she is currently
headed back to the shrine.

149
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:52,833
Back to the shrine?

150
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,166
I'm coming home!

151
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Nanami!

152
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:05,416
No!

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,666
The torii gate!

154
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,750
The shrine!

155
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,583
There is no mistake.

156
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,625
That is the miasma
of the tsuchigumo.

157
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,000
Tsuchigumo?

158
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,583
Do you not remember, Onikiri?

159
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,291
The one Lord Mikage vanquished
several hundred years ago.

160
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,916
That tsuchigumo!

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,458
Oh no!

162
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:23,583
Lord Mikage was able to overcome
it, but its remaining miasma

163
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,291
was far too tainted.

164
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,583
He could not completely
exorcise it, so he decided

165
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,708
to seal it away somewhere.

166
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,750
I suppose this means the
seal was undone, then.

167
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,541
I suppose so but how?

168
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,958
Either way, there is not
anything we can do about it!

169
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:43,958
Kotetsu!

170
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,375
Kotetsu!

171
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,041
Max Tailwind!

172
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,833
Lady Nanami!

173
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:54,875
Go!

174
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,250
Kotetsu!

175
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,458
Lady Nanami!

176
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,208
You have returned to us!

177
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,208
What happened, Kotetsu?

178
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,000
Are you okay?

179
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,416
You must not, Lady Nanami!

180
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,666
We are supernatural beings and
shall be fine, but it would

181
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,541
cause you much harm if you came
into contact with this miasma.

182
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,041
You must not touch me.

183
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,583
You must not.

184
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:20,833
Kotetsu.

185
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,166
I'm sorry!

186
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,458
I disappeared and
didn't say anything!

187
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,541
Lady Nanami!

188
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,208
Lady Nanami!

189
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,541
You need to know, if this
miasma is allowed to reach town,

190
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,250
it will be disastrous.

191
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,541
Somehow.

192
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:37,041
Somehow it must be stopped.

193
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,625
Don't worry; I'll protect
the town no matter what.

194
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,166
After all, there are people
looking forward to our festival!

195
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,125
Lady Nanami!

196
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,958
Lady Nanami!

197
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:53,583
So.

198
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,125
Not that bad?

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,250
Where is she?

200
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,791
Nanami.

201
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,083
A tsuchigumo?

202
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,583
It is showing its true form.

203
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,625
That is definitely
a tsuchigumo!

204
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:26,833
Uh.

205
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,125
Is it just me or is
that thing way scary?

206
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,458
It is not just you!

207
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,083
Nanami, wait!

208
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,291
The tsuchigumo is backing
away from her dance.

209
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,875
Nanami's kagura dance.

210
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,875
There's no hesitation.

211
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,250
Tomoe.

212
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,208
When did she get to be so--?

213
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,458
Lady Nanami is so beautiful.

214
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,000
And so brave!

215
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,666
Look at her.

216
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

217
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,625
She is lovely to watch.

218
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,166
Mikage?

219
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,333
Right.

220
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,000
Left.

221
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:37,750
Right.

222
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,208
Left.

223
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,875
Right.

224
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,083
Left.

225
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,583
Right.

226
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:44,750
That is perfect.

227
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,875
You remembered well.

228
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,125
Here it comes.

229
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,208
The spot where
you always stumble.

230
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:53,583
She fell.

231
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,625
Lady Nanami!

232
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,375
Timing.

233
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,500
Ugh.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,291
Lady Nanami!

235
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,083
Tomoe!

236
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,458
Listen to me.

237
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,333
Nanami, you are the girl

238
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:36,333
I recognize as my
lady and mistress.

239
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:38,541
You have nothing to fear.

240
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,041
Tomoe!

241
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,041
Nanami!

242
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,291
Your bells!

243
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,375
Mizuki!

244
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,083
I'll help you with
your kagura dance.

245
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,333
Are you ready?

246
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,416
She is fabulous.

247
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,833
Thank goodness.

248
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,583
She is exactly the sort of
girl I believed her to be.

249
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,291
Oh.

250
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,500
Do you mean to say, you,

251
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,625
anticipated this from
the very beginning?

252
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:05,666
Well.

253
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,541
Who knows?

254
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,541
Nice.

255
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,791
She did it.

256
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,125
Mikage!

257
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,666
Mikage?

258
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,208
Nanami!

259
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,750
Are you hurt?

260
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:21,958
I did it.

261
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,250
I did it.

262
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,875
You saw me, didn't you?

263
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,625
Yes.

264
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,375
Lady Nanami!

265
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,708
Look, Kotetsu is also fine!

266
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,458
Oh, good!

267
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,375
What a relief!

268
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,750
I'm happy.

269
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,375
So happy!

270
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,625
Lady Nanami!

271
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,541
Thank you so very much!

272
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,958
Nanami, you are amazing.

273
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,500
Hey, Tomoe.

274
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,291
What is it?

275
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,958
Please, catch me.

276
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:10,791
After that came the much
anticipated autumn festival!

277
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:14,083
Oh, looks like
it's very successful.

278
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,041
Well, this shrine
isn't abandoned at all!

279
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,166
Yeah, it's really nice.

280
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,708
I just love the energy.

281
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,250
I can't believe how many
people there are here!

282
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,500
Well, I might have passed
out a handful of flyers.

283
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,000
But all the
festival arrangements.

284
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,500
When did they get done?

285
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,208
We made the preparations.

286
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,583
I brought some lively young
folk to help as well.

287
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,791
We assisted in the preparations.

288
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,458
Himemiko!

289
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,833
Where did you get that outfit?

290
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,041
It's adorable!

291
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,208
You think so?

292
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:39,750
Hey!

293
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,250
Freshwater fish!

294
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,666
You better not be starting
things without me!

295
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm the Dragon King, after all.

296
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,416
It's not a party
until I'm here!

297
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,125
Wow!

298
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,708
You came, Dragon King?

299
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,500
Well, I did get an invitation
from you asking me to come!

300
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,166
And I did so, even though
this festival is held on land

301
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,291
and reeks of mammals!

302
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,666
Reeks of mammals?

303
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,208
Meanwhile, every single one
of you reeks of yokai!

304
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,958
Make some effort to
conceal yourselves!

305
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,708
Oh, fine, what the heck.

306
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,041
Wonderful, now we
all stink like mammals.

307
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,083
Lady Goddess of the land?

308
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,291
We are pleased to
make your acquaintance.

309
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,250
We are the headsmen of the yokai
kind who live to the south.

310
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,833
We are here because
we heard the land god

311
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,125
would perform a kagura dance.

312
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,958
If we bear witness to your
blessed dance, then truly--

313
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,083
It shall spiritually
invigorate us.

314
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,333
We thank you for your blessing.

315
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,083
Good grief.

316
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,666
Please, give me a break ladies.

317
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
This is a personal day for me.

318
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,833
Oh, good, looks like
Nanami's been found.

319
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,000
If you don't
wanna be recognized,

320
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,666
maybe don't dress so flashy.

321
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,958
Hey, shopkeeper.

322
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,000
Can I get a mask?

323
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,041
Sure thing!

324
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,458
This one here is
called a death mask.

325
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,000
Guess what it can do!

326
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,125
I hear it shows
your face in death.

327
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,750
You can keep the change.

328
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,041
Was that guy human?

329
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,083
Lady Nanami!

330
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,500
It is time for
your kagura dance!

331
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,041
Oh.

332
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,291
Right.

333
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,833
We are going to prepare
for you to get changed!

334
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:58,833
We shall be waiting for you!

335
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,541
'Kay!

336
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,750
I managed it in front
of the tsuchigumo.

337
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,708
But dancing in front of an
audience of people makes

338
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:08,083
me nervous in a
completely different way.

339
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,500
You'll be fine, little girl.

340
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,208
Hey!

341
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,583
You're that he-she guy.

342
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,583
Who are you calling he-she guy?

343
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,708
Here you are; I bought
these sweets in town.

344
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,458
They're for you.

345
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,708
Oh, what for?

346
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,500
For knowing you can do
the dance magnificently.

347
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,708
So long, little girl!

348
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,416
Let's meet again sometime!

349
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:36,625
Look!

350
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,708
There she is!

351
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,916
So pretty!

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,791
Nice.

353
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,791
That night, the festival reached
its zenith and brilliantly

354
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,791
lit up the hearts of all who
were blessed enough to be there.

355
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,750
I am glad the festival
was such a success!

356
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,750
The rumors that the
Mikage shrine is abandoned

357
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,625
will surely fade away now.

358
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:50,208
You did perfect, Nanami, and
your kagura dance was beautiful.

359
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,791
Oh, thank you, Mizuki.

360
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,500
But my back is killing me.

361
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,083
Ow.

362
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,333
Well, on the bright side,

363
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,125
we're sure to get some
more worshippers now.

364
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,083
True!

365
00:20:59,166 --> 00:20:59,791
Boo.

366
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:01,375
We're all out of sake.

367
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll go get some more.

368
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,166
You know, we can prepare
something delicious

369
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,333
to serve along with it, as well.

370
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:07,958
Onikiri?

371
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,416
Right!

372
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:17,875
So, tell me what you
thought about my dancing.

373
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:18,708
Yes.

374
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,916
Quite an achievement.

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,958
You did well.

376
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,708
And anything else?

377
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:24,000
Anything else?

378
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:24,958
That is all.

379
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,583
There's nothing else?

380
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:27,916
Really?

381
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,416
'Cause Mizuki said he
thought it was beautiful.

382
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,708
Guess not, though.

383
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,125
It was beautiful.

384
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,916
More beautiful than anything.

385
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:45,708
What did you say?

386
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,041
Speak up; I couldn't hear you.

387
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,666
Yes you could; you
heard me just fine.

388
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,458
Come on!

389
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:50,500
Maybe just one more time!

390
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:51,666
Oh, shut up.

391
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,208
Okay, I heard you.

392
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,416
I'm happy.

393
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,000
Nanami.

394
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,333
May I seal the familiar
contract with you?

395
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,333
What?

396
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:10,541
But the familiar contract-- 

397
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,375
It is from the heart.
