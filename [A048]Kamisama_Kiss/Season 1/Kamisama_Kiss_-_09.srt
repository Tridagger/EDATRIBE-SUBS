1
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:42,041
Using the time-wending incense
burner; Nanami arrived in

2
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,166
the past encountering Tomoe,
who had just then stolen

3
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,958
the Dragon King's right eye.

4
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,583
Now, he is standing before her.

5
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,708
Although, she hardly
recognizes this wild fox.

6
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:01,958
That's it.

7
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,958
That's the Dragon King's eye.

8
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:11,583
Wait!

9
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,458
Come back!

10
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:14,583
Tomoe!

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,333
He's getting away!

12
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,833
There's no way you'll be able
to catch up to him on foot.

13
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,791
Times likes these must make it
tough to be a land god.

14
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,916
I'm sorry about this!

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,250
That's right.

16
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,583
The Tomoe of this time
period hasn't met me yet.

17
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,083
He wouldn't recognize me.

18
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:40,333
So, do you have any idea
where he's going?

19
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,875
Hm, perhaps he's late to
a party and is bringing

20
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,500
the Dragon King's
eye as a side dish?

21
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,458
Not funny!

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,000
We have to get it back!

23
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,750
He'll understand if I explain
the situation to him!

24
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,041
Silly girl.

25
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:54,083
He won't empathize because
he doesn't know you.

26
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,625
I believe the only
option now is to steal.

27
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,583
Think you can handle it?

28
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,166
You mean break in?

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,458
Is that his house?

30
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,583
Looks like it!

31
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:19,083
I can smell the salt.

32
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,666
You went all the way to
the sea to buy medicine?

33
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,791
Yes.

34
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,916
What I have found
was worth the risk.

35
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,875
Now all you have
to do is take this

36
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,708
and your illness will be cured.

37
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,500
Yukiji.

38
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:37,125
Get well, live
eternally with me.

39
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,833
That's his voice and his face

40
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,916
and yet I can hardly
recognize him.

41
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:54,250
He did it for her.

42
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:58,000
He stole the eye and put his
life at risk for that woman.

43
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,791
She's so beautiful.

44
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,416
Is this the first time
you've felt the pain

45
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,083
of jealousy and envy, Nanami?

46
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,750
You understand me now.

47
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,083
It is too large
to swallow like this.

48
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,000
I will need to find some water.

49
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,083
Such a rare cure must
be consumed properly.

50
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,833
I shall return.

51
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,708
Now is your chance.

52
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,041
She's too weak to fight back.

53
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,333
Go in and take it.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,791
Stop hesitating, Nanami.

55
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,541
If it were up to me,
the task would be completed.

56
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,500
That woman is in your way.

57
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,416
Hang in there!

58
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,625
It'll all be over soon.

59
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,916
Just take this!

60
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,625
Here.

61
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:00,375
What are you doing?

62
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,500
Have you lost your mind?

63
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,083
Mizuki?

64
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,333
You traveled all the way here
to find the Dragon King's eye.

65
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,666
Why would you give it away?

66
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,083
She's sick.

67
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,750
Do you realize what you could
be risking if you decide

68
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,833
to choose her life over another?

69
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,250
I wasn't thinking.

70
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,875
I'm here because I wanted
to save Tomoe's life.

71
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:19,708
Still do.

72
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,250
But there's another person
suffering right in front of me.

73
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,541
I can't stand by and do nothing!

74
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,458
Give it back!

75
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,125
I know that was hard.

76
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,208
Thank you.

77
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,583
But why?

78
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,833
It's okay.

79
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,583
Thank goodness!

80
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,291
Look how quickly
it healed her illness!

81
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,041
That's great.

82
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,541
Let's go.

83
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:02,250
Wending through time as your
corporal self does not last.

84
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,958
Your time is up.

85
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,041
The solution was never going
to be found in the past.

86
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:13,416
What I owe now, I have
to pay in the present.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,250
Somehow.

88
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,541
Welcome back!

89
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:24,750
I have to go!

90
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,250
You shouldn't try
to stand up so quickly.

91
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,041
I imagine you're sore.

92
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,333
Wending through time can be
quite rough on the human body.

93
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:33,958
So, what do you plan to do now?

94
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,750
That woman I met--Isohime.

95
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,583
Is there any way I could
find her again in the present?

96
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,500
Isohime?

97
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,125
Why would you want to see her?

98
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,500
She said something to me
that I want to ask about.

99
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll make you a deal.

100
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,208
Give me the Dragon King's
eye inside you and in return,

101
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,166
I will give you my warm cloak.

102
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,458
She told me that the Dragon
King's eye was inside of me.

103
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,500
Then she asked if I'd be
interested in trading it

104
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,458
for her cloak.

105
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:01,958
I wonder if that's it.

106
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:06,750
Could it be the key
to saving Tomoe?

107
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,958
What's going on?

108
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:08,875
It looks like you're
running some kinda shop

109
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,083
out of this cave.

110
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,041
I'm only here for
a limited time!

111
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,416
How 'bout this fruit?

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Feed it to any lady and
she'll do whatever you say!

113
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:17,208
Won't find one like
it anywhere else.

114
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,541
I'll trade you for that
gold ring on your finger.

115
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,833
Good deal, right?

116
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,458
Dude, what the heck?

117
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:25,666
Is it high tide?

118
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,041
Uh, maybe we should go back!

119
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,500
I'm not done with you!

120
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,958
You have not changed a bit
in five hundred years.

121
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,583
But thanks to that,
you were easy to track down.

122
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,041
And just who the hell are you?

123
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,041
We need to talk.

124
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,041
I want to make a deal with you.

125
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,291
Really?

126
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,541
And so on and so forth;
and so on and so forth;

127
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,625
and so on and so forth;
and so on and so forth;

128
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,500
What did you just say?

129
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,250
I don't want you to be burdened
with the Dragon King's eye!

130
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:47,750
Give it to me!

131
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:48,416
Where is it?

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,083
You put it in here?

133
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:50,208
Well, hold on a sec.

134
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,083
I have to say, you
were a lot different

135
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,541
five hundred years ago.

136
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,500
That's not what I meant!

137
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,541
You told me the Dragon King's
eye was inside of me.

138
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,875
I need you to help me
get it out.

139
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,500
Let's see.

140
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,000
That's interesting.

141
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,041
Something's definitely
swimming around in there.

142
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,625
It looks like the
King's eye except that

143
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,708
it's completely
worn down and tiny.

144
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,041
Are you serious?

145
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,375
Don't let this bod fool ya.

146
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,958
I know what I'm doing.

147
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:18,125
All right, what are you going to
give me in exchange for this?

148
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,208
Anything you want!

149
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,416
As long as it's
in my power to give!

150
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,833
Really?

151
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,041
Well then--

152
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,291
I want thirty years
of your life!

153
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,458
Take it or leave it!

154
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,500
That's the best deal I've got!

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,208
Thirty years is not a
deal; it's a rip-off!

156
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,666
She knows you're desperate so
she's taking advantage of you.

157
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,916
Don't trust her.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,791
And how exactly do you
plan to help her, then?

159
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,500
You don't even know
where the eye is!

160
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,416
Both my eyes have Second Sight!

161
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,625
There's nothing
I can't see through.

162
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:47,958
Keep out of this, you
pathetic snake-boy has-been.

163
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,666
Okay, let's make a deal!

164
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,541
You can have
thirty years of my life.

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,458
There's a girl who
knows how to bargain!

166
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,416
Nanami, don't!

167
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,500
Don't do it.

168
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,666
It'll be okay.

169
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,125
I'm still young, you know.

170
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,583
Not like I'm gonna die
if she takes thirty years.

171
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,625
Don't worry about me.

172
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,291
It's Tomoe who might only have
one more day left to live.

173
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,416
You're so ridiculous.

174
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,916
You are barely capable
of doing anything.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,208
Why are you taking these risks?

176
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,541
You always get in
over your head and

177
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,166
take on more than
you can handle.

178
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,791
I can't put up
with this anymore.

179
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,250
Go ahead and lie down.

180
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:39,208
Let's begin.

181
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,541
You can give me your
years upon delivery.

182
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,416
Just relax for now.

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,750
It'll all be over soon.

184
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,125
Why, thank you, Second Sight.

185
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,666
My my.

186
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,833
It appears that you have
something much more valuable

187
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:12,666
than years,
Little Miss Land God!

188
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,208
A Dragon King's eye
and a Land God's soul!

189
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,000
Ha!

190
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,000
What a lucky day to be me!

191
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,250
I tried to warn you.

192
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,125
I thought this might happen.

193
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,083
Would it have been so
difficult for you to listen

194
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,166
and trust me to protect you?

195
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,875
Tomoe only has himself
to blame for what happened.

196
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,750
It is not your responsibility
to take on his debt.

197
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,541
Your kindness is relentless.

198
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,916
Nothing I said was
going to stop you.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,416
Familiars at your service are
pointless since your mortal soul

200
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,625
is what leads you
to protect others.

201
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,875
Your heart is what
leads me to serve you.

202
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,291
This is my way.

203
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,250
Of showing how much
I truly respect you.

204
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,916
The cage around my heart
is breaking away.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,416
You just-- but why?

206
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,875
I will continue
to stay by her side.

207
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,666
And then--I'll be able
to be myself again.

208
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,375
Greetings, my new
lady and mistress.

209
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,708
Did you have a nice rest?

210
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,083
Today is the first day
that I, Mizuki,

211
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,875
serve you as your new familiar!

212
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,041
I'll be so useful that I'll blow
Tomoe right out of the water!

213
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:54,625
Huh?

214
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,416
Wait a second!

215
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,875
What exactly do you mean?

216
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,041
Good news, right?

217
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,250
What happened was--

218
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,458
Not so fast.

219
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,833
You tried to hurt and
deceive my lady and mistress.

220
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,708
It wouldn't be right for me
to let you get away with that,

221
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,625
would it?

222
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,000
Mizuki, stop!

223
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,791
Don't you dare kill her!

224
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,791
Sacred Word Binding.

225
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:19,416
It ensures absolute obedience.

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,916
Sweet paralysis.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,500
What a pleasure being held
under a god's control.

228
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,625
It's euphoric!

229
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,291
Please give me more
commands, Nanami!

230
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,458
Tie me up with your
invisible chain of words!

231
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,625
You're disgusting!

232
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,666
Am I hearing this right?

233
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,416
Did you actually
kiss me in my sleep?

234
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,416
You pervert,
that's sexual assault!

235
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,000
That assessment is
a little over-the-top;

236
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:41,250
but I am glad you're
adapting to the new changes.

237
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,333
Is this the Dragon King's eye?

238
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,750
It's barely the size
of a pachinko ball.

239
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,000
Who cares what size it is?

240
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,791
It's still the Dragon
King's eye, isn't it?

241
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,083
Let's hurry and
get it back to him!

242
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,708
A deal is a deal, right?

243
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,125
Can we discuss what
happened with Isohime?

244
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,375
Look, I never took anything.

245
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,375
So just take those
and we'll call it even!

246
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,041
All we got were tickets to
the Dragon King's palace.

247
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,750
I still don't think that
you should have let her off

248
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,500
the hook so easily.

249
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,375
I was just worried about
getting her out of here

250
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:15,958
so you wouldn't kill her.

251
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:20,041
I assure you, a familiar will
never kill in front of his god.

252
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:22,666
Surely Tomoe was
the same, right?

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,291
He never wanted you
to see his dirty work.

254
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,125
It might have upset you.

255
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,250
Lord Dragon King!

256
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,166
There's trouble headed
right toward us!

257
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,125
Shut up!

258
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,000
Can't you see I'm calculating?

259
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,375
But sir, it's the white lipped
oyster in the banquet hall!

260
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,791
Tomoe?

261
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,833
Good grief.

262
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,916
The sensation of being wrapped
up in flesh brought back

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,916
such fond memories.

264
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,750
It's been a long time,
Dragon King, has it not?

265
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:58,291
You had quite some nerve showing
your face in front of Nanami.

266
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,416
Smart move, as you know I will
not conduct bloody business

267
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,750
in front of my mistress.

268
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,291
Which is why
I decided to change venues.

269
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:08,291
Wow!

270
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,833
This is amazing!

271
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,875
You really do have to ride on
the back of a turtle to get

272
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:13,916
to the Dragon King's palace!

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,291
Nanami, please.

274
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,625
I told you that window will
let everything through

275
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,750
except for water.

276
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,166
I need you to be
very careful.

277
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,583
Now I can rescue Tomoe.

278
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,916
I'll get to see him
in the present again,

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,875
where he remembers me!

280
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,458
Wait.

281
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,583
What's gotten into me?

282
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,750
Mizuki?

283
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,833
Yes?

284
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,000
What's wrong?

285
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,333
Yukiji.

286
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,708
Do you think Tomoe still--.

287
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,333
Do you think he still
has feelings for her?

288
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,583
I'm scared now.

289
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,291
I'm worried about
seeing him again.

290
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,416
All I'm going to
think about is her.

291
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,291
I can't help but compare.

292
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,875
He was so different.

293
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,041
He was sweet to her.

294
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:08,125
They were passionate.

295
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,833
He clearly loved her.

296
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,500
He won't even touch me.

297
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,041
No!

298
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:15,708
Shut up!

299
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,458
Now is not the time!

300
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,000
My negative thoughts
are eating me alive!

301
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,375
Why don't we just
forget the trip?

302
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,250
Why would I want to do that?

303
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,875
You don't seem
enthusiastic about it.

304
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,541
In fact, you look
quite miserable.

305
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,625
Hey, would you mind
telling us what's going on?

306
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:34,791
New passenger boarding
at an unscheduled stop.

307
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,750
Pardon me for
sharing your ride.

308
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,083
One of the dragon folk?

309
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,666
We don't mind at all, welcome.

310
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,166
No!

311
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,708
Not at all!

312
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,333
It's a pleasure.

313
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,541
Nice to meet you!

314
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,916
Oh great!

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
Why am I the only woman
I know that doesn't

316
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,125
look like a goddess?

317
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,583
I am very curious as to
why a land god would want

318
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,083
to visit a dragon's palace?

319
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, uh.

320
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,625
That's a very good question.

321
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,916
Really weird--my friend
is being held as collateral

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,958
so I'm going to go get him.

323
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,041
Oh my, how terrible for you!

324
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,958
I am sure he is looking
forward to seeing you again.

325
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:05,291
I understand.

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,916
You see, I am on my way
to see my beloved husband.

327
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,916
I hope we will both see
our loved ones soon.

328
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,708
Wow!

329
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,125
What beautiful embroidery!

330
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,791
May I ask what that is?

331
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,916
It is called a haori half-coat.

332
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I spent seven days
on the needlework.

333
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,083
In times when I cannot be
with my love, that is how

334
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,083
I remind him of
my eternal feelings.

335
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,083
What a beautiful gift.

336
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,750
I could never make
something like that no matter

337
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,041
how much time I spent.

338
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,500
The half-coat!

339
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,000
Watch out!

340
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:46,958
But the coat she's
been working on for days

341
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,416
just flew out the window!

342
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,000
We have to go get it!

343
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,541
Please, no.

344
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,583
What?

345
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,583
With that volume of water,

346
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:59,416
I have no doubt that it has
been carried away by now.

347
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,833
More importantly, I think that
stray current may have been

348
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:04,541
due to a tremor
coming from the Palace.

349
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,625
I can always make
another half-coat.

350
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,250
Let us head to the
palace immediately.

351
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,125
But you spent
so many days making it.

352
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,708
Yes I did!

353
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,791
And because of that, those days
went by very joyfully indeed.

354
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,375
The memories mean just as much!

355
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
I see.

356
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,875
I feel so ashamed.

357
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,458
Until just moments ago, the only
thing I'd been thinking about

358
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,250
was all the ways someone I cared
for didn't return my feelings.

359
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,583
When did I become
so self-centered?

360
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:42,625
"He doesn't care for me."
"He won't touch me."

361
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:46,166
Now I think I understand.

362
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,708
No way!

363
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,666
So this is where
the Dragon King lives?

364
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,125
Wow.

365
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,416
I seem to have lost Mizuki
somewhere along the way.

366
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,791
Whoa!

367
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,000
Sounds like someone's
doing construction!

368
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,000
Just as I feared.

369
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,625
Something is
definitely going on.

370
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,083
Lady Kamehime!

371
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,166
Sea Slugs.

372
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,000
What is all the
commotion about?

373
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,958
The fox prisoner suddenly
went on a rampage, sea slug.

374
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:14,541
The Lord Dragon King is putting
him down in the western palace,

375
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,958
sea slug.

376
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,791
No.

377
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,500
Tomoe!

378
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,916
Very impressive.

379
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,041
You're much more beastly

380
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,375
now than when I saw
you on the beach.

381
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,250
You were right about
the way you look.

382
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,750
Even a thousand year love
would cool if that girl

383
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,375
ever saw you like this.

384
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,208
So then you know Nanami?

385
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:39,833
She came pestering me,
demanding that I give you back.

386
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:42,208
She offered to go find
my right eye and return it

387
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,250
in exchange for you.

388
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
That is absolute rubbish.

389
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,541
She is the only land god who
is incapable of anything.

390
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,500
That crazy girl is a land god?

391
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,000
I thought that
she was your lover!

392
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,208
She may not look the part,

393
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:57,416
but she is still the
god of Mikage Shrine.

394
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
She is not some woman
to be touched carelessly

395
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,666
with sullied hands.

396
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,041
Tomoe!

397
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,125
I'm so glad to see you!

398
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,791
What?

399
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,916
What is the point of shutting
yourself up in there?

400
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,708
I already know everything!

401
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,708
Come out!

402
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,333
It's too late
to try to deny it!

403
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,541
Fine then.

404
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,166
Well, I went to the past
and met the old you.

405
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,625
I don't care anymore that
you won't open up to me

406
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:33,583
or if you don't
want to touch me.

407
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:36,583
That's okay.

408
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:40,166
Even if you have feelings for
someone else, that's okay.

409
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,500
I've decided I'm not going
to wait for my feelings

410
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,625
to be returned anymore.

411
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,291
You are too close!

412
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,375
It doesn't matter that you
don't see me in that way.

413
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:17,791
I know someday
you'll change your mind.

414
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,666
Even if you were
to refuse to see me

415
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,000
as anything more than a friend.

416
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:32,041
Nothing will change the fact
that I have feelings for you.

417
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,333
Ya' know why?

418
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,541
Because it's enough.

419
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
Are you ready to go home now?

420
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,541
I don't get it.

421
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,375
Nothing about her
says 'Land God.'

422
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,166
All I can see is a human girl.

423
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,125
It's nonsense.

424
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:55,916
Um, sir?

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,791
Someone is here.

426
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,500
Hello, Darling.

427
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,916
Do you have any explanation

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,833
for the unsightly state
of this palace, my love?

429
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,666
I thought you were
visiting your family!

430
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,166
I've missed you, my sweet wife!

431
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,083
Wife?

432
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:09,458
She's married to him?

433
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,208
You are still toying
with that wild fox

434
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,625
in spite of what happened?

435
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,041
When your eye was stolen,
you promised me you would

436
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,291
never allow another
scar upon your face!

437
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,875
Did you forget
about that, sweetie?

438
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:18,541
Of course not!

439
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,000
I can explain!

440
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,000
That Land God insisted
on looking for my eye

441
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,166
and returning it to me.

442
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,333
Isn't that right, Land God?

443
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,333
Tell the truth!

444
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,750
Oh right!

445
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,375
I did want to return it!

446
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,708
Here it is!

447
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,875
What the heck?

448
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,083
It's all shriveled up!

449
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,666
Yeah, but if you could
just look past that?

450
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,125
No.

451
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:37,666
Forget it.

452
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,333
The deal's off.

453
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,875
All right, then.

454
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,291
Why don't we renegotiate
for this beautiful half-coat

455
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,333
I found?

456
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,541
There you are!

457
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,166
You're really offering
me a scrap of cloth?

458
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,041
You think you can do business
with me using a piece of trash?

459
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,416
Oh, no.

460
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I figured you would want
the beautiful gift your wife

461
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:54,916
spent several days
making for you.

462
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:56,750
Or not?

463
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:57,916
Oh well.

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,958
Perhaps something
like this isn't equal to

465
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,166
the value of a fox?

466
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,458
You've got a deal!

467
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:03,708
Mizuki!

468
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,791
So that's where you went!

469
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,625
To go find the half coat!

470
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,333
Please explain to me
why you are here.

471
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,583
Why wouldn't I be here?

472
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,291
I was so worried about
my big brother familiar.

473
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,208
What?

474
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,750
Oh that's right,
he doesn't know.

475
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,666
You and I are going to be taking
care of the shrine together.

476
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:22,250
What?

477
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,958
I think it's time to go home.

478
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:30,875
For all three of us!

479
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,166
Let's travel back
several hundred years ago

480
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,625
to when Tomoe became
Mikage's familiar!

481
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,875
Can't wait to see what life
was like for these two.

482
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:54,500
Next time, "Tomoe
Becomes A Familiar".

483
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,208
What?

484
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,125
There's another story?

485
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,500
And "The God Goes To A Mixer"!

486
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,458
My stars!

487
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,958
I love a double feature!
