[FEVELLE] OH!

138
00:07:24,907 --> 00:07:26,973
[WOMAN] ONE DAY, THE KING OF

139
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,640
WITH HIS ARMY OF GOBLINS.

140
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,107
THEY BEGAN DESTROYING
VILLAGES AND CASTLES,

141
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,407
EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO RUIN
OUR FIELDS FULL OF CROPS.

142
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:40,240
BUT THE HEROES RESPONDED QUICKLY
AND DEFEATED THE MONSTERS
ONE AFTER THE NEXT.

143
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,540
THEY VANQUISHED THE INVADERS
THAT HAD ONCE COVERED

144
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,573
THE BEACHES AND
BLACKENED THE FOREST.

145

146

LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS
OF THE MONSTERS.

HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

149
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,107
[FEVELLE] I THOUGHT THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE IMMORTAL.

150
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,907
[WOMAN] THE ONE WHO DIED WAS NOT
ONE OF THE IMMORTAL VISITORS.

151
00:08:01,007 --> 00:08:03,740
HE WAS MERELY ONE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND...

152
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,373
A BOY WHO LONGED TO BE A HERO.

153
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:08,673
[APRETTA]
OH, MY GOODNESS.

154
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,807
[WOMAN] THE HEROES DID
NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

155
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,040
THEY BEGGED THEIR MOST
POWERFUL WIZARD TO SAVE HIM.

156
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,707
BUT NOT EVEN THEIR WISEST
AND MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE LEADER

157
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,573
KNEW HOW TO RESTORE ONE OF
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

158
00:08:20,673 --> 00:08:23,640
[BOY IN VEST] KEEP GOING!
[BOY IN JACKET] YEAH!
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?!

159
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,507
[WOMAN] SO THE WISE WIZARD
THOUGHT AND THOUGHT,

160
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,040
AND HE CAME UP WITH SOMETHING.

161
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,907
HE CREATED AN ENTIRELY
NEW FORM OF MAGIC,

162
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,973
ONE THAT HAD NEVER EXISTED
IN THIS WORLD BEFORE.

163
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:36,640
HE CONJURED A MIRACLE.
(SHIROE GASPS)

164
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,207
[WOMAN] AND SO THE YOUNG
BOY RETURNED TO LIFE
AND BECAME A HERO.

165
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,573
[CHILDREN] WOAH!

166
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:46,907
[WOMAN] BUT SOON AFTER,
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO
THE WIZARD.

167
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,040
[CHILDREN] WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?

168
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,673
[WOMAN] I'M AFRAID THAT'S
ALL FOR TODAY, CHILDREN.

169
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:53,307
WE'LL JUST START FROM
THERE NEXT TIME.

170
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,573
[CHILDREN] OH! AW...

171
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:58,373
WOW. HOW'D SHE
KNOW ALL THAT?

173
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,007
(CHUCKLES)

174
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:07,207
[REGAN] OH, HELLO THERE.
I AM HONORED BY YOUR VISIT.

175
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:11,407
AND I WOULD SAY THAT
SOME CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER, SHIROE.

176
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:13,207
[SHIROE] HMM? FOR WHAT?

177
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:16,973
THE CREATION OF A
NEW TYPE OF MAGIC.

178
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,607
UHH. HOW'D YOU
HEAR ABOUT THAT?

179
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:21,040
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

180
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,840
I SENSED A MAGIC UNKNOWN
TO ME IN THE EAST.

181
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,007
AND I SAW ITS LIGHT
FILL THE SKY.

182
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,140
IT WAS WORLD‐CLASS MAGIC,

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,740
THE LIKES OF WHICH CAN
ALTER THE LAWS, THE FATES,

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,007
AND THE VERY EXISTENCE
OF THE WORLD.

185
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:38,307
YES, YOU ARE INDEED EVERY
BIT THE MAN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE, SHIROE.

186
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,807
[SHIROE] YEAH, MAYBE, I GUESS.

187
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,573
BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN IT
WAS POSSIBLE WITHOUT YOU.

188
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,107
[REGAN] YOU HONOR ME.

189
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:47,740
INCIDENTALLY, I ALSO FELT THE
PRESENCE OF A POWERFUL MAGIC

190
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,973
RISING IN THE WESTERN SKY
JUST RECENTLY AS WELL.

191
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,540
[SHIROE] IN THE
WESTERN SKY?

192
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,140
[REGAN] IT WOULD SEEM TO ME
THAT SOMEONE BESIDES YOURSELF

193
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,407
HAS ALSO LEARNED HOW TO
CREATE A NEW FORM OF MAGIC.

194
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:01,473
I MUST ASSUME...

195
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:04,140
IT'S ONE OF THE ADVENTURERS?

196
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,073
(SHIROE GASPS)

197
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:18,939
[SHIROE] THE WESTERN SKY...
ADVENTURERS...

198
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,472
SO THAT MEANS...

199
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:24,872
IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE IN MINAMI, RIGHT?

200
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:30,172
[SHIROE VOICE‐OVER]
AKIHABARA, SHIBUYA,
MINAMI, SUSUKINO, NAKASU.

201
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:32,606
IT'D HAVE TO BE REASONABLE
TO ASSUME THAT AKIHABARA

202
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,806
WASN'T THE ONLY ADVENTURER CITY
TO EXPERIENCE A MAJOR CHANGE

203
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:38,539
SINCE THE APOCALYPSE.

204
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,206
ALMOST ALL THE
SHIBUYA ADVENTURERS
HAVE GONE TO AKIHABARA.

205
00:10:42,306 --> 00:10:44,906
UNFORTUNATELY, SUSUKINO
WAS STILL IN DECAY

206
00:10:45,006 --> 00:10:49,139
WITH THE GUILD OF BRIGANDIA
HOLDING DOMINION OVER
EVERYONE THERE.

207
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:51,039
EVER SINCE WE WENT AFTER SERARA,

208
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,472
WE'VE CONTINUED TO SEND
EXPEDITIONS TO LIBERATE
ANYONE WHO WANTS TO LEAVE.

209
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,306
BUT THAT STILL MEANS THERE
ARE OVER 200 ADVENTURERS

210
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:01,139
WHO CONTINUE RULING OVER
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

211
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:04,872
MINAMI'S STILL AN UNKNOWN.

212
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:09,139
[SHIROE] YAMATO WAS ONCE UNITED
AS A SINGLE KINGDOM, RIGHT?

213
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,506
[REGAN] YES.

214
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,539
[SHIROE] I READ UP ON IT
AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING.

215
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,806
INTERESTING.

216
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:17,306
LONG STORY SHORT,
THE UNIFIED WESTELANDE EMPIRE...

217
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:20,106
IT BASICALLY ENDED UP LOST
TO THE HISTORY BOOKS

218
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:24,306
BECAUSE OF THEIR CONSTANT
CONFLICTS WITH THE LUQUENJE
AND DEMI‐HUMANS.

219
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,706
THE COWEN FAMILY OF EASTAL
IS DISTANTLY RELATED.

220
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:30,372
[REGAN] THEY ARE. AND,
OF COURSE, THE HOLY EMPIRE
WESTELANDE IS AS WELL,

221
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,706
WHICH PRESIDES OVER THE
WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY.

222
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:36,772
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
INSIDE THAT TERRITORY IS
A CITY LIKE AKIHABARA,

223
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:38,439
FULL OF ADVENTURERS, MINAMI.

224
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:42,539
HOWEVER, LIKE SUSUKINO,
ONE GUILD RULES THE CITY.

225
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,372
DID YOU KNOW THE DEMON FESTIVAL
OF SUZAKU GATE WAS OUT WEST?

226
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,272
I AM MOST CERTAINLY AWARE.

227
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:52,272
THOUGH FOR SOME REASON,
THE EASTERN NOBLES DON'T
SEEM TO HAVE NOTICED THAT YET.

228
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:57,872
[SHIROE] THEN YOU MUST ALSO KNOW
THAT THE FESTIVAL IS SIMILAR TO
THE RETURN OF THE GOBLIN KING.

229
00:11:57,972 --> 00:12:00,906
THEY'RE BOTH EVENTS REGULARLY
GENERATED BY THE GAME SERVER.

230

HAPPENING IN MINAMI.

FOUND YOU, SHIROE.

OF HIDE‐AND‐SEEK IS OVER.

LEARN THE HARD WAY

I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU
FOR SAVING ME IN SUSUKINO.

322
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,706
IT WAS REALLY NICE AND ALL.

323
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,872
BUT...

324
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:39,306
[SERARA] THE CRESCENT MOON
ALLIANCE HAS DONE A LOT FOR ME.

325
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:44,806

A GOOD GIRL. YOU KNOW THAT.

HE TRICKED THE PRINCESS

342
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:29,272

ONTO THE BATTLEFIELD

345
00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:34,639
AND USED HER TO MAKE DEMANDS
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

CALL HIM A VILLAIN.

347

I THINK THE ONLY THING
I MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH

374
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:43,330
WAS TO SLOW YOU DOWN.
