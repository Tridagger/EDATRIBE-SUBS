00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:10,038
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] IN ALL
THIS TIME, MINORI HAS NEVER
REALLY ASKED FOR MY HELP.

2
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:13,138
ADVICE, YES.
STRATEGY AND KNOWLEDGE, YES.

3
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:18,904
BUT UNTIL NOW, SHE'S
NEVER COME RIGHT OUT
AND ASKED FOR HELP.

4
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:21,638
SO SOMETHING'S WRONG.

5
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:24,604
[MINORI] PLEASE HELP US!
WE HAVE A CASUALTY!

6
00:00:24,704 --> 00:00:28,804
IT'S RUNDELLHAUS.
A DIRE WOLF GOT HIM.

7
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,571
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

8
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,438
HE'S ONE OF THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

9
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,595
GET A HOLD OF KARASHIN.

10
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,195
HE'S GOING TO BE TAKING OVER.

11
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,362
[NEMIMI] HUH?

12
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,495
(GRIFFIN WHISTLE)

13
00:02:14,595 --> 00:02:18,128
[SHIROE, THINKING] THERE ARE
SOME THINGS I CAN'T DO,

14
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:21,962
NOT EVEN HERE IN
THIS TWISTED WORLD,

15
00:02:22,062 --> 00:02:26,362
THIS WORLD WITHOUT
MANY LIMITATIONS. BUT...

16
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,528
MINORI CALLED.

17
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,628
AND I'M GONNA TRY.

18
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,995
(GRIFFIN SCREECHING)

19
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,862
[SHIROE] WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

20
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,262
[MINORI, VOICE‐CHAT]
RUNDELLHAUS WAS FATALLY WOUNDED
WHILE DEFENDING CHOSHI.

21
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:48,395
WE'VE CAST TWO REVIVAL SPELLS,
BUT THEY HAVEN'T WORKED.

22
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:52,595
HE STILL HAS A PULSE, AND HE'S
STILL WARM TO THE TOUCH.

23
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:54,495
BUT HE HASN'T COME AROUND YET.

24
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,328
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

25
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:59,128
[SHIROE] WHERE ARE YOU EXACTLY
AND WHO'S THERE WITH YOU?

26
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:02,695
[MINORI] IT'S TOYA, ISUZU,
SERARA, AND ME...

27
00:03:02,795 --> 00:03:04,028
AND RUNDELLHAUS.

28
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:08,028
AND, LET'S SEE, WE'RE
NEAR THE CROSSROADS.

29
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:09,828
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO
THE CENTER OF TOWN.

30
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,128
[SHIROE] IS IT SAFE?

31
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,628
[MINORI] THERE AREN'T
ANY GOBLINS HERE,

32
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,795
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF
FIGHTING GOING ON AT THE COAST.

33
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:20,062
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE
COMING BACK TO THIS
PART OF TOWN OR NOT.

34
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:22,962
[TOYA] SHIROE, WE NEED
YOU TO HELP SAVE RUDY!

35
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:26,228
I'M THE ONE WHO BROUGHT RUDY
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:29,762
IT'S MY FAULT.
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
(CRYING)

37
00:03:29,862 --> 00:03:33,762
WE REALLY DO NEED YOUR
HELP DOWN HERE. PLEASE!

38
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:36,428
[SHIROE] HAVE SERARA CAST
A REVIVAL SPELL.

39
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,828
[MINORI] RIGHT.

40
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:41,128
[SHIROE] WAIT 150 SECONDS.
HAVE TOYA KEEP WATCH.

41
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:44,328
ISUZU SHOULD USE A MAGIC
POINT RESTORATION SONG.

42
00:03:44,428 --> 00:03:47,828
AFTER THAT 150 SECONDS,
CAST ANOTHER REVIVAL SPELL.

43
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,528
[MINORI] OK!

44
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:52,462
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE ENERGY THAT ANIMATES
HUMANS AND DEMI‐HUMANS

45
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:53,762
IS CALLED THE SPIRIT.

46
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:55,095
IT HAS 2 PARTS.

47
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,528
PSYCHE IS THE ENERGY
THAT ANIMATES THE MIND.

48
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:00,262
THIS IS THE SOURCE OF MAGIC.

49
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,895
AND IT'S EXPRESSED
AS MAGIC POINTS.

50
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:06,062
[REGAN] ANIMA IS THE ENERGY
THAT ANIMATES THE BODY.

51
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,728
YOU CALL THEM HIT
POINTS, OR HEALTH.

52
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,462
IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS KI OR CHI.

53
00:04:11,562 --> 00:04:13,662
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] WHEN
SOMEONE IS DEFEATED IN BATTLE,

54
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,695
THEY CAN NO LONGER MOVE.

55
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,595
BUT THE MIND REMAINS HEALTHY.

56
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:23,128
THEN THE ANIMA DISPERSAL BEGINS.

57
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,428
ANIMA DISPERSAL IS
WHEN THE ANIMA, THE BODY,

58
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,428
IS DISPERSED AND VANISHES.

59
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:30,662
REVIVAL MAGIC GATHERS
THE ANIMA DISPERSED

60
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:35,028
INTO THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE
AND PUTS IT BACK TOGETHER.

61
00:04:35,128 --> 00:04:38,195
REGAN HAD A HYPOTHESIS THAT
YOU COULD USE THE REVIVAL MAGIC

62
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:42,962
ON AN NPC IF YOU USED IT
IMMEDIATELY AFTER SOMEONE DIED.

63
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,962
IF HE STILL HAS A PULSE,
THEN HIS BODY AND HIS ANIMA

64
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:48,028
COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY RESTORED.

65
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:50,495
BUT IF HE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS,
THEN HIS PSYCHE,

66
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,128
THE POWER OF HIS MIND
HAS STARTED TO DISSIPATE.

67
00:04:53,228 --> 00:04:55,895
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
IN DANGER OF LOSING.

68
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,462
THE MIND DISPERSES
ALONG WITH THE BODY,

69
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,195
EACH BECOMING UNENTANGLED.

70
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,028
AND WHEN THE BODY IS
COMPLETELY GONE,

71
00:05:03,128 --> 00:05:07,928
THE MIND HAS NOWHERE TO RETURN,
MAKING REVIVAL IMPOSSIBLE.

72
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:11,728
THIS IS THE POINT AT WHICH
PEOPLE OF THE LAND DIE.

73
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:16,295
ADVENTURERS, ON THE OTHER HAND,
FIND THEMSELVES REINCARNATED
AT THE CATHEDRAL.

74
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:21,228
PSYCHE AND ANIMA ARE REJOINED,
AND LIFE CONTINUES.

75
00:05:21,328 --> 00:05:22,928
[MINORI] WE ARE AT 150 SECONDS.

76
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,062
STARTING MY NEXT REVIVAL SPELL.

77
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:28,795
[SHIROE] IN ANOTHER 150,
USE THE REVIVAL SPELL AGAIN.

78
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,595
I'M STARTING MY DESCENT.

79
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,595
KEEP ON ALTERNATING YOUR
SPELLS FOR ANOTHER 8 MINUTES.

80
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:35,228
[MINORI] OK!

81
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,162
[SHIROE, THINKING] ALL WE CAN DO
RIGHT NOW IS MAKE SURE HIS BODY

82
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:39,428
DOESN'T BREAK UP ANY MORE.

83
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:41,162
BUT THEN WHAT?

84
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:42,895
[KANAMI] NOW, SHIROE,

85
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,995
ISN'T IT YOUR JOB
TO THINK OF SOLUTIONS?

86
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,028
[SHIROE] UH, BUT, YEAH. MAYBE.

87
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,562
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN
JUST WHISK YOU AWAY TO SEE

88
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:52,095
THE MIDNIGHT SUN IN ICELAND.

89
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:54,828
[KANAMI] OH, COME ON. BUT I
REALLY WANT TO SEE IT, SHIROE.

90
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:57,028
I'M A DREAMER, YOU KNOW.

91
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:01,328
AND YOU MAKE MY DREAMS
COME TRUE, RIGHT?

92
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,695
[SHIROE] YEAH, I GET IT.
[AKATSUKI] UH?

93
00:06:03,795 --> 00:06:06,895
[REGAN] MY OWN SPECIALTY IS
A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT I LIKE

94
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:10,395
TO REFER TO AS WORLD‐CLASS
MAGIC AND ENCHANTMENTS.

95
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,562
[SHIROE] AH! MAGIC THAT
ALTERS THE RULES THAT
MAKE THE WORLD WORK.

96
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:19,462
OH! AKATSUKI, REINS.

97
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,895

DOING OUT THERE?

LARGER VARIETY.

113
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,895
[RAYNESHIA] IS IT
THE GOBLIN KING?

114
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:21,062
[KRUSTY] YOU WON'T CATCH HIM
OUTSIDE OF SEVENTH FALL.

115
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:24,528
MOST LIKELY, IT'S THE
GOBLIN GENERAL'S FORCES.

116
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:25,662

ON TO ZANTLEAF

120

IF I CAN REALLY DO IT

122

OR WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF IT WORKS.

123
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:49,262
THAT'LL DO.

[SHIROE] AH.

00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,228

126
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:56,195
[MINORI, VOICE‐CHAT] THE OCYPETE
HAS GOTTEN INTO CHOSHI.

TO PREVENT THE LANDING.

[AKATSUKI] ROGER.

133
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,362
[SHIROE] GET EVERYONE
OUT OF THE AREA.

134

DON'T LET ANYONE NEAR,

135
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:22,862

138
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:37,962
[MINORI] YES.

139
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:40,395
WE DID EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

140
00:08:44,328 --> 00:08:46,595

ADD ME TO IT.

141
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:47,862
[MINORI] OK.

00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,428
[SHIROE] YOU'RE ISUZU, RIGHT?
[ISUZU] HM?

143
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,328
[SHIROE] KEEP ON CASTING

00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,062
[MINORI] A NEW SPELL?

149
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:04,395
YOU WILL AGREE
OR I WON'T DO IT.

150
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:05,628
AND THEN IT'S OVER.

00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:13,528

[SERARA] I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THAT BEFORE.

155
00:09:17,995 --> 00:09:19,895
[MINORI] IT MEANS HE
CAN TAKE THE MAGIC POINTS

156
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:21,728
FROM ALL THE
MEMBERS OF A PARTY

157
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,862
AND GIVE IT BACK TO
EVERYONE EQUALLY.

158

(CHILDREN SHUDDERING)

IS THE VESSEL OF THE MIND,

161

AND IT IS ALSO A
PERSON'S MAGIC POINTS.

162
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,895
AND THAT MEANS...

(GRUNTS)

164
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,828

00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:43,018
(GASPS)

333
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,651
"ADVENTURER"!

334
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:50,718
WOW! I DID IT.

335
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:57,051
OH, MAN! I'M AN ADVENTURER
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

336
00:20:57,151 --> 00:20:58,951
(HEAVY DOOR OPENS)

337
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,318
[ISUZU] RUDY!
[RUDY] HUH?

338
00:21:02,184 --> 00:21:05,684
[RUDY] AH! MISS ISUZU.

339
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:11,351
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE? OH, I GET IT.

340
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,251
YOU PROBABLY USED A RETURN
SPELL TO GET BACK, RIGHT?

341
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:17,051
YOU MUST BE THE BIGGEST IDIOT
I'VE EVER MET IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

342
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,151
YOU COULD HAVE DIED, MORON!

343
00:21:19,251 --> 00:21:20,851
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF RUDE.

344
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,418
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING
TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE

345
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:25,518
FOR YOUR DUTY, MISS ISUZU.

346
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,551
IF I SAY "WAIT,"
YOU WAIT, DUMMY!

347
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:30,351
WHOA. HEY, LET'S TAKE IT EASY.

348
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:31,718
I SAID "WAIT"!

349
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:32,818
[RUDY] AH...

350
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,518
OH, I'M SORRY.

351
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:40,384
I GUESS I MADE YOU
WORRY BACK THERE, HUH?

352
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,284
AH! OW...

353
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:46,918
OK? SO I WAS RIGHT. UGH!

354
00:21:47,484 --> 00:21:49,518
I‐I'M SORRY? UGH!

355
00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:52,884
I WON'T DO IT AGAIN,
I PROMISE!

356
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:54,018
[RUDY] AH!

357
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:55,218
I GET IT! I GET IT!

358
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,084
I'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU SAY, MISS ISUZU!

359
00:21:57,184 --> 00:22:00,318
JUST STOP HITTING
ME, PLEASE!

360
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:04,151
[ISUZU] REALLY?
[RUDY] YES. REALLY‐REALLY.

361
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:05,484
I SWEAR TO GOD.

362
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:07,051
[ISUZU] AND YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF

363
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:08,584
AND ABOUT WHEN
YOU WERE A KID.

364
00:22:08,684 --> 00:22:10,851
[RUDY] WHY DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?

365
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:14,051
(ISUZU GROWLS)

366
00:22:14,151 --> 00:22:16,984
RIGHT. FINE. OK.
I'LL TELL YOU.

367
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,318
[ISUZU] AND THE NEXT TIME YOU
PULL A CRAZY STUNT LIKE THAT,

368
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:21,118
I'LL MAKE SURE YOU
WON'T LIVE THROUGH IT.

369
00:22:21,218 --> 00:22:23,051
[RUDY]
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

370
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:27,318
[ISUZU] GIVE ME YOUR PAW.
[RUDY] HUH?

371
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:30,618
(ISUZU CHUCKLES)

372
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:32,751
(RUDY CHUCKLES)

373
00:24:14,418 --> 00:24:15,851
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THE BATTLE HAS ENDED.

374
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:18,651
EASTAL AND THE ROUND TABLE
TAKE A NEW STEP FORWARD.

375
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:22,218
TO CELEBRATE THEIR VICTORY,
A BALL IS HELD.

376
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:25,318
BUT NOT EVERYONE IS
FEELING A SENSE OF CHEER.

377
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,951
FALL IS COMING TO THE
TOWN OF AKIHABARA,

378
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,784
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

379
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:32,918
[SHIROE] WE WILL
CHANGE THE WORLD.
