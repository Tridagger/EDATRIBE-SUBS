(ROAR)

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,146
[NAOTSUGU]
DUDE! THAT'S HUGE!

3
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,783
[SHIROE] IT WAS ONE THING
TO VISIT THIS PLACE WHEN
ELDER TALES WAS STILL A GAME,

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,218
BUT NOW...

5
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,120
[AKATSUKI] YES. IT'S
DEFINITELY A LOT DIFFERENT

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,156
NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING IT
IN PERSON, MY LORD.

7
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,826
[SHIROE] THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

8
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,228
WE'VE MADE IT, GUYS.

9
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,730
AKATSUKI HERE.
NO ENEMIES IN SIGHT.

10
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,132
[NAOTSUGU]
SWEET! LET'S GO
ON AHEAD, SHIROE.

11
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,834
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.

12
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:27,413
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IT'S BEEN 3 DAYS SINCE
WE LEFT AKIHABARA

13
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:32,252
TO SAVE A GIRL NAMED
SERARA WHO CAN'T GET
OUT OF SUSUKINO.

14
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,423
GRIFFINS ARE POWERFUL
BUT HAVE LIMITS.

15
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,093
THEY CAN ONLY BEAR A
RIDER FOR 4 HOURS A DAY.

16
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,196
BE THAT AS IT MAY,
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
TWO WEEKS ON HORSEBACK

17
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,465
TO GO THE SAME DISTANCE.

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,835
WE'VE REACHED THE
TEARSTONE MOUNTAINS.

19
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,236
LOOK, MY LORD.
UP AHEAD.

20
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,006
[SHIROE]
HMM. WYVERNS.

21
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,542
(ROAR)

22
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,044
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S JUST LIKE
WE THOUGHT, SHIROE.

23
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,445
[SHIROE] IT'S ALMOST
A RELIEF TO KNOW

24
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,915
THE SPAWN POINTS FOR
MONSTERS ARE THE SAME.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,284
LET'S TAKE
THIS UNDERGROUND.

26
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,521
[SHIROE] THE ONLY WAY
TO REACH EZZO,

27
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,356
WHERE SUSUKINO IS LOCATED,
IS TO GO OVER THESE MOUNTAINS,

28
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,892
THEN CROSS THE CHANNEL.

29
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,528
[NAOTSUGU] HIKING IS GONNA
BE DANGEROUS AND TIME‐CONSUMING.

30
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,529
OH!

31
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,130
[SHIROE]
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
UNDERGROUND.

32
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,965
(NAOTSUGU GROANING)

33
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,701
[NAOTSUGU]
THAT'S HUGE!

34
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,636
[SHIROE] THE DEPTHS OF PALM
IS A COMPLEX MAZE

35
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:26,306
OF ANCIENT TUNNELS
AND ABANDONED MINESHAFTS.

36
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,641
ONCE WE'RE THROUGH,

37
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,744
WE'LL BE ON THE NORTHERN
SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS.

38
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,382
WHOA, MAN.
I HAD A HIGH‐DEF
VIEWER AT MY PLACE,

39
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,151
AND IT STILL DIDN'T
DO THIS JUSTICE.

40
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,620
(CRACKING)

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,754
OOH! UH!

42
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,923
[SHIROE] I GUESS NOT,
AND IT'S FALLING APART.

43
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:46,259
[NAOTSUGU] I DON'T REMEMBER
IT BEING A FOOTING HAZARD
IN THE GAME.

44
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,094
[SHIROE] HMM.

45
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,262
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD.

46
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,397
(SCREECHING)

47
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,669
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE RAT‐LIKE PEOPLE, RAT‐MEN.

48
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,740
ONE OF THE MANY
TYPES OF DEMI‐HUMAN
CREATURES IN THIS WORLD.

49
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,542
[NAOTSUGU] LOW LEVEL,
EASY TO BEAT,

50
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:03,409
BUT JUST A NIBBLE FROM
ONE OF THESE LITTLE TURDS

51
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,011
WILL GIVE YOU THE PLAGUE.

52
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,246
[AKATSUKI]
THEY'RE NOT ATTACKING.

53
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,781
[SHIROE]
THEY NORMALLY WON'T ATTACK

54
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,283
ANYTHING THAT HAS A DISTINCT
LEVEL ADVANTAGE LIKE WE DO.

55
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,352
IT SHOULD BE OK,
BUT JUST REMEMBER

56
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,721
THAT EVEN A CORNERED
RAT WILL BITE A CAT.

57
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:18,525
THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO
IS FACE THEM IN CONFINED SPACE.

58
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,160
[SHIROE AND NAOTSUGU] UH!

59
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,294
[AKATSUKI]
SPEAKING OF.

60
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,429
[SHIROE]
YEAH. LIKE THIS.

61
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,067
[NAOTSUGU]
HOLY CRAP. SHOULD WE,
UH, SMACK THEM AROUND?

62
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,569
[SHIROE] I'D LIKE
TO AVOID COMBAT,

63
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,072
AND FIGHTING OFF THE PLAGUE
WOULD DEFINITELY BE WORSE.

64
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,974
LET'S FIND
ANOTHER WAY AROUND.

65
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,677
AGREED.

66
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:40,013
[NAOTSUGU]
HA HA! MUCH BETTER.

67
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,682
[SHIROE] AH. YEAH.

68
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,585
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, I JUST
SCOUTED THE FLOOR AHEAD.

69
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,054
[SHIROE] THANKS. CAN YOU
TELL ME WHAT WAS THERE,

70
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,723
"MISS" AKATSUKI?

71
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,225
[AKATSUKI] MMM...

72
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,794
"AKATSUKI."

73
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,228
[SHIROE]
UH, SORRY.

74
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,997
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND EAT, NAOTSUGU?

75
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:59,099
[NAOTSUGU] UH...

76
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,067
BECAUSE THE CRAPPY
FLAVOR OF NOTHINGNESS

77
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,804
IS DRIVING ME
FREAKING CRAZY!

78
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:08,975
IF YOU TRY TO COOK IT,
IT'S TWICE AS DISGUSTING!

79
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,276
(CRYING)

80
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,546
[SHIROE] RIGHT. NO MATTER
HOW GOOD IT LOOKS,

81
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,115
IT'S STILL ALL
TASTELESS HERE.

82
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,150
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE COMMAND MENU WILL
LET YOU MAKE ANYTHING

83
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,484
IF YOU HAVE THE
RIGHT ITEMS.

84
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,021
THAT'S A CARRY‐OVER
FROM THE GAME, I GUESS.

85
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,389
ALL: UM.

86
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,292
[SHIROE] BUT THE FOOD
ALL TASTES THE SAME... AWFUL.

87
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,995
I'VE HEARD THAT EVEN PEOPLE
WITH THE CHEF SUBCLASS

88
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,197
CAN'T MAKE IT
TASTE ANY BETTER.

89
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,701
STRANGE THING, THOUGH... SALT,
SUGAR, FRUITS, AND VEGETABLES

90
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,703
ARE CONSIDERED INGREDIENTS
BY THE SYSTEM,

91
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:40,140
AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE
THEIR ORIGINAL FLAVORS.

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,608
KNOWING THAT IS
PROGRESS, I GUESS.

93
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,810
[NAOTSUGU] TODAY'S
LUNCH WAS SALTY MUSH.

94
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,079
TODAY'S BREAKFAST
WAS SUGARY MUSH.

95
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,016
AND FOR DESSERT WAS MORE
MUSH WITH A SIDE OF MUSH.

96
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:53,253
I COULD USE A
DRIVE‐THROUGH OR A
VENDING MACHINE RIGHT NOW.

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,621
(RINGING)
UH?

98
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,257
[AKATSUKI]
WHO'S CALLING NOW,
MY LORD?

99
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,225
[SHIROE]
HMM. IT'S MARIELLE.

100
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,462
[MARIELLE] HI, SHIROE.
WHERE ARE YOU?

101
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:04,865
WAIT. WHAT?

102
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,800
YOU'VE MADE IT TO
DEPTHS OF PALM?

103
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,503
YOU'VE REALLY GONE ALL
THAT WAY IN ONLY 3 DAYS?!

104
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,037
[HENRIETTA]
WHAT'S THAT?!

105
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:14,074
AND IS MY PRECIOUS AKATSUKI
SAFE THERE WITH YOU, SHIROE?

106
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,308
(AKATSUKI GASPS)

107
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,743
[MARIELLE] I KNOW
YOU TOLD ME YOUR PLAN,

108
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:20,046
BUT WE'RE STILL, LIKE,
CRAZY WORRIED OVER HERE.

109
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,082
OK. ANY UPDATES?

110
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,483
HOW'S SERARA?

111
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:25,151
[MARIELLE] OH, RIGHT.

112
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,352
SHE CAN STILL GET
IN TOUCH WITH ME

113
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,689
VIA THE TELEPATHIC
LINK OR WHATEVER.

114
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,824
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
TELEPATHIC LINKS
CAN ONLY BE USED

115
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,826
WITH PEOPLE ON
YOUR FRIEND LIST,

116
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,428
AND YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO SEE THEM RIGHT IN
FRONT OF YOU TO ADD THEM.

117
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,864
LONG‐DISTANCE ADDS
AREN'T POSSIBLE.

118
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,967
[MARIELLE]
SHE SAID SHE'S HIDING WITH
THAT NICE GUY I MENTIONED

119
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,669
AND THAT SHE'S OK FOR NOW.

120
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,105
[SHIROE] HUH. THAT'S GOOD.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

121
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,241
[SHIROE] I GUESS THE
SITUATION IN SUSUKINO
ISN'T ALL BAD AFTER ALL.

122
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,710
I GUESS SO.

123
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,412
[SHIROE] SO SOMEONE'S
GIVING HER A HAND.

124
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,115
I WONDER WHO IT COULD BE.

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,888
(GASP)

126
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:08,061
[SERARA] MY MAID LEVEL IS 44.
IT WAS AT LEVEL 42 YESTERDAY.

127
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,495
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

128
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,431
I JUST HAD TO GO AND PICK
THE MOST USELESS SUB‐CLASS

129
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,366
INSTEAD OF SKILLS
I COULD THINK OF.

130
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,770
I REALLY SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE HANDS‐ON,

131
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,040
THAT MAKES THINGS OR
CREATES THINGS, YOU KNOW.

132
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,777
MAYBE A WEAVER OR AN ARTISAN
OR SOMETHING, BUT NO.

133
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:28,348
I KEEP LEVELING UP AS A
MAID BECAUSE I'M SO BORED.

134
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,816
OH, GOD, WAIT A SECOND.

135
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,252
THIS ISN'T REALLY SO
MUCH LIKE A MAID.

136
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,087
THIS IS MORE LIKE...

137
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,923
BEING A HOUSEWIFE!

138
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,526
(SCREAMS)

139
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,962
UH‐UH. THERE'S NO
WAY THAT'S TRUE!

140
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,566
MAYBE I'M A MAID WAITING
FOR MY KITTY‐CAT HUSBAND
TO COME BACK TO ME!

141
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,534
[MAN] HMM, SERARA.
[SERARA] AAH!

142
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,236
[MAN]
I'M BACK HOME, MEOW.

143
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,506
[SERARA] WELCOME HOME,
MASTER NYAN‐TA.

144
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:56,209
HMM. THANK YOU, BABY.
HOW WAS TOWN?

145
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,911
[SERARA] THE SAME.
I WAS CAREFUL.

146
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,346
[NYAN‐TA] IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
YOU MADE IT BACK SAFE,

147
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,615
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

148
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,349
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT MATTERS.

149
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,551
(THUD)

150
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,786
[MAN 1] WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE KIDDING

151
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,521
WITH ALL THAT CHEERFUL
MERCHANT CRAP?

152
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,255
[MAN 2] YOU THINK ALL
OF YOU NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS

153
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,624
CAN JUST RIP US OFF?

154
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:12,526
AND THERE'S MORE WHERE
THIS CAME FROM IF YOU TRY

155
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,927
STANDING UP TO BRIGANDIA.

156
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,662
[MAN 1] YEAH.
YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

157
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,731
[MAN 3] YEAH. WE OUGHT
TO MAKE THAT OUR MOTTO.

158
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,866
(CRASH)
[BULLY 1] HEY, LOOK AT THIS!
[MEN] HUH?

159
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,402
[BULLY 2] AH, YEAH. THAT'S
A SPECIAL FROM LAST YEAR...

160
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,804
[BULLY 3] FINDERS KEEPERS.

161
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,039
[BULLY 4] ARE THESE REALLY
ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS?

162
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,542
THIS PLACE SUCKS!

163
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,411
NOW, NOW. DON'T LET
IT GET TO YOU, GIRL.

164
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,946
THERE'S ONLY SO
MUCH YOU CAN DO.

165
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,216
IF YOU LET IT BOTHER YOU,
YOU'LL DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY.

166
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,185
[SERARA]
UH, RIGHT.

167
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:43,389
[NYAN‐TA]
AND ONCE AGAIN, I'VE COME
HOME TO A SPARKLING HOUSE.

168
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,659
YOU'RE GONNA BE A
GREAT WIFE ONE DAY.

169
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,662
[SERARA]
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, REALLY.

170
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,897
[NYAN‐TA]
HOW ARE THOSE PEOPLE
YOUR FRIENDS SENT? MEOW.

171
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,334
UH, RIGHT. MARIELLE
GAVE ME AN UPDATE.

172
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,336
THEY'RE MOVING
REAL FAST.

173
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,072
SHE SAID THAT
THEY'RE ALREADY PAST
THE DEPTHS OF PALM.

174
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:02,876
[SERARA] SHE SAID THEY'LL
PROBABLY ARRIVE SOMETIME
BEFORE NOON TOMORROW.

175
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,112
[NYAN‐TA]
THAT SOON? HMM.

176
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,614
RATHER IMPRESSIVE.

177
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,450
IN FACT, IT'S SO IMPRESSIVE
IT MAKES ME WONDER

178
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:13,386
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
SHE SENT OUR WAY.

179
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,757
(WATER RUSHING)

180
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,859
[MARIELLE] THANKS, AGAIN,
SHIROE. LIKE, REALLY.

181
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,493
JUST BE CAREFUL OUT THERE.

182
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,495
[SHIROE] I WILL.
TALK TO YOU LATER.

183
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,730
[NAOTSUGU] I SEE
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER

184
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,199
WE USED GRIFFINS TO
GET AHEAD ON THIS.

185
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,201
[SHIROE]
NO, I DIDN'T.

186
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,236
[NAOTSUGU]
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

187
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,412
[HENRIETTA] SO TELL ME, HOW DO
YOU SUPPOSE SHIROE AND HIS PARTY

188
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,614
ARE GOING TO CROSS THE CHANNEL?

189
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,215
[MARIELLE]
DON'T KNOW.

190
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,018
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT FIGURING
IT OUT ONCE THEY GOT THERE.

191
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:48,054
HE PROBABLY HAS SOME
SECRET SPECIAL PLAN.

192
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,757
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ISN'T
A SITUATION HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT

193
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,959
IF YOU GIVE HIM
THE TIME TO DO IT.

194
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,961
[HENRIETTA] BUT WHY WOULD
SOMEONE WITH HIS TALENTS,

195
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,898
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE
REFUSE TO JOIN A GUILD?

196
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,466
[MARIELLE] WELL, I'M SURE
HE HAS A GOOD REASON.

197
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,236
[GIRL] UM, EXCUSE ME.
[MARIELLE] HUH?

198
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,839
WHAT IS IT, LILIANA?

199
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,309
MARIELLE, THE REST OF
OUR MEMBERS ARE HERE.

200
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,013
[MARIELLE]
OK. DID EVERYONE COME?

201
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,417
[EISEL] ABOUT 60% OR SO.
NO REPLY FROM 10%.

202
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,152
30% REFUSED.

203
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,420
UH, WELL, YEAH.

204
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,455
OUR GUILD MASTER IS
COMING PRETTY SOON.

205
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:23,557
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

206
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,358
JUST HANG ON A
LITTLE LONGER.

207
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,060
[GROUP] UH!

208
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:31,131
[MISA] WOODSTOCK W
FROM GLENDALE IS THERE,

209
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:35,435
ALONG WITH ICHIMONJINOSUKE
AKANEYA FROM RADIO MARKET.

210
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,637
AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES.

211
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,938
ALONG WITH THEM,
SEVERAL GUILD MASTERS

212
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,773
OF THE SMALLER GUILDS
HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER

213
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,643
IN THE CRESCENT MOON
ALLIANCE'S HALL.

214
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,578
[KRUSTY] IS THAT RIGHT?

215
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:46,780
[TAKAYAMA] YES.
AND ALSO, SHIROE

216
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,184
FROM THE DEBAUCHERY TEA
PARTY IS ON THE MOVE.

217
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,221
HE'S CURRENTLY
LEADING A SMALL
GROUP TO SUSUKINO.

218
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,490
SUSUKINO?

219
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,125
AH.

220
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,426
(SHIMMER)

221
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,762
[TAKAYAMA]
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

222
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,797
[KRUSTY] NO. DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

223
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,700
(STONES CRUMBLING)

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,169
[NAOTSUGU]
WHOA! GOOD GRIEF!

225
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,538
HEY, WASN'T THIS
BRIDGE IN THE GAME?

226
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,773
[SHIROE] YEAH.

227
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,041
[NAOTSUGU] WAS IT
ALWAYS FALLING APART?

228
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,009
(CRACK)
OH!

229
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,444
[SHIROE] NAOTSUGU!
AKATSUKI! STOP!

230
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,281
(CRACKING)

231
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:24,017
[NAOTSUGU]
GIVE ME A BREAK!

232
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,052
[SHIROE]
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIND ANOTHER WAY.

233
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,623
LET'S BACKTRACK ONE AT
A TIME. THAT SHOULD GET‐

234
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,324
UH! AKATSUKI!

235
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,159
(AKATSUKI GASPS)

236
00:11:34,595 --> 00:11:36,763
[SHIROE] AAH!

237
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:39,499
MY LORD!

238
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,803
[AKATSUKI]
UH! UH!

239
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,339
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD! MY LORD!

240
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,455
[SHIROE]
NOT LIKE THIS.

241
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:09,563
IF I DIE HERE, I'LL WIND
UP BACK IN AKIHABARA.

242
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,231
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD?
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE!

243
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,365
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD!

244
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,100
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE!

245
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,807
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
I'VE NEVER BEEN WHAT
YOU'D CALL OUTGOING.

246
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,676
EVEN WHEN I WAS
WITH MY FRIENDS,

247
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,311
PART OF ME WAS
ALWAYS ALONE.

248
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,753
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED
GETTING INTO ELDER TALES.

249
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,187
AND THEN...

250
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,689
[TARAREBA]
OH, YOU'RE SHIROE, RIGHT?

251
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,123
I'VE HEARD ALL
ABOUT YOU.

252
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,226
THEY SAY YOU'RE, LIKE,
A TOTALLY AMAZING ENCHANTER.

253
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,962
IT IS AN HONOR, MAN!

254
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,597
(CROWD TALKING)
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,

255
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:45,666
I WAS RECOGNIZED AS
AN EXPERIENCED,

256
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,002
KNOWLEDGEABLE
VETERAN OF THE GAME.

257
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,837
[MAN 1] THANKS, MAN.
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

258
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,405
I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

259
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,407
[WOMAN] I FOLLOWED THE
ROUTE YOU TOLD ME ABOUT,

260
00:12:54,508 --> 00:12:55,676
AND IT TOTALLY WORKED!

261
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,077
[MAN 2] THANKS, SHIROE!
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

262
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,012
[MAN 3] IS THAT YOU?
[MAN 4] YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.

263
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,581
[MAN 5]
THANKS FOR HELPING.

264
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,182
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
BUT THERE'S TWO SIDES
TO EVERY COIN.

265
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,917
[KAIGANJIN] HEY, HOW DO WE
GET TO TITAN RINGS?

266
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,652
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?
[MAN 1] I NEED HELP.

267
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,387
[MAN 2] WILL YOU HELP
ME WITH THAT NEW QUEST

268
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,555
IN MOGAMI, PLEASE?

269
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,557
[WOMAN]
TELL ME, SHIROE!

270
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,626
[MAN 3]
COULD YOU TAKE ME THERE?

271
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,327
[MAN 4] ME, TOO.

272
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,495
[WOMAN] COME ON, SHIROE.

273
00:13:15,596 --> 00:13:17,898
[MAN 5] WELL? TELL ME.
DON'T HOLD OUT ON ME, MAN.

274
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:19,065
[MAN 6] COME ON!
COME WITH ME.

275
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,568
(SHIROE SIGHS)
[SHIROE] GOOD GRIEF.

276
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,804
[MAN 7] SERIOUSLY...

277
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,672
[KANAMI] THE BEST PART
ABOUT ADVENTURES

278
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,341
IS ALL THE NEW EXPERIENCES.

279
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,377
[SHIROE] HUH? OH.

280
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,551
[SOJIRO] EXPERIENCES?

281
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,853
[KANAMI] YUP. ISN'T IT AMAZING
HOW EACH NEW EXPEDITION

282
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:41,655
JUST FILLS YOUR HEART?

283
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,724
[NAOTSUGU] ALMOST AS
MUCH AS HOTTIES DO.

284
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,191
[SOJIRO]
COME ON, NAOTSUGU...

285
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,728
KEEP IT CLASSY IN FRONT OF
THE LADIES, WILL YOU?

286
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,029
[NAOTSUGU]
WHATEVER, DUDE.

287
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,331
YOU'RE ALREADY A CHICK
MAGNET, SO STEP OFF!

288
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,167
[SOJIRO] YEAH. I CAN'T HELP
IF THEY FIND ME ADORABLE.

289
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,571
[NAOTSUGU] I KNOW! IT'S,
LIKE, ONE OF THE MOST
UNFAIR THINGS EVER!

290
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,939
IT'S NOT WORTH
CRYING OVER.

291
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,108
[KANAMI] HA HA! WOULD
YOU LOOK AT THE SUNSET!

292
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:07,213
THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS FOR.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT, SHIROE?

293
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,615
[SHIROE] HUH?

294
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,951
[KANAMI] HEY THERE.
EARTH TO SHIROE.

295
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,554
ARE YOU LOST IN
THOUGHT AGAIN?

296
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:15,321
SHIROE!

297
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,790
[SOJIRO] SHIROE?

298
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,924
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT'S WRONG, SHIROE?

299
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,360
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD! MY LORD!

300
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,795
[NAOTSUGU] SHIROE!

301
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,631
[AKATSUKI]
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

302
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,900
(SHIROE STAMMERS)
[NAOTSUGU]
OH, HEY, WELCOME BACK.

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,603
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MY LORD?

304
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,071
[SHIROE]
WHAT? WHERE AM I?

305
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,873
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, PIPSQUEAK
HERE GOT YOU OUT OF THERE.

306
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,108
AFTER YOUR LITTLE SWAN DIVE,
SHE JUMPED IN AFTER YOU

307
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,010
AND GOT YOUR HEAD
ABOVE THE WATER.

308
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,714
[AKATSUKI] WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU
GOT US BACK TO DRY LAND.

309
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,783
AND DON'T CALL ME PIPSQUEAK!

310
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,950
[SHIROE] I SEE.

311
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,852
THANKS FOR YOUR
HELP, NAOTSUGU.

312
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,353
AND YOU, TOO, AKATSUKI.

313
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,221
(AKATSUKI GASPS)

314
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,223
[AKATSUKI]
ME, TOO. I MEAN...

315
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,057
HUH?

316
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:54,127
UH... UM, THANK YOU.

317
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,495
[SHIROE]
UH, FOR WHAT?

318
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:58,364
[AKATSUKI]
NO, UH, THANK YOU
TO NAOTSUGU.

319
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,733
[NAOTSUGU] HA HA!

320
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,504
LOOK, BEFORE YOU GET
ALL MUSHY, WE SHOULD
GET MOVING AGAIN.

321
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:04,638
[SHIROE] RIGHT.

322
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,740
THIS IS CRAZY.

323
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,408
THAT WAS, LIKE,
A 7‐STORY DROP.

324
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,444
I SHOULD BE FREEZING COLD,
AND I'M BARELY HURT AT ALL.

325
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:13,747
[NAOTSUGU]
HMM. MAYBE YOU
CAN CHALK THAT UP

326
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:16,349
TO BEING IN YOUR
LEVEL 90 GAME BODY.

327
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,751
HMM.

328
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,553
[NAOTSUGU] I MEAN,
AFTER ALL THIS WALKING,

329
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,555
I'M HARDLY TIRED AT ALL.

330
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:24,424
SO ARE WE EVEN CLOSE
TO GETTING OUT OF HERE?

331
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:25,959
[SHIROE] WE ENDED UP
TAKING THE LONG WAY,

332
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,061
BUT YEAH, WE'RE CLOSE.

333
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:31,031
[AKATSUKI] YOU REALLY ARE GOOD
AT CARTOGRAPHY, AREN'T YOU?

334
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,733
[SHIROE]
SCRIBE IS MY SUB‐CLASS.

335
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,500
ON TOP OF THAT,
BACK IN THE WORLD,

336
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,002
I WAS ALSO A
CAD OPERATOR.

337
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,071
[NAOTSUGU]
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE SURE WAS.

338
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,174
[AKATSUKI]
"CAD"? WHAT'S CAD?

339
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,076
[SHIROE]
"COMPUTER‐ASSISTED DRAFTING."

340
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,012
I DO IT AT MY UNIVERSITY.
I'M AN ENGINEERING STUDENT.

341
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,814
[AKATSUKI] SO YOU'RE
A COLLEGE STUDENT?

342
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,249
WELL, GRADUATE SCHOOL.

343
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,452
I'M ABOUT TO GET
MY MASTER'S, OR I WAS.

344
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,787
[AKATSUKI] OK.

345
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,524
SO THEN I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
AND I ROUGHLY THE SAME AGE.

346
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,327
RIGHT?

347
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,630
[SHIROE] AHH!
[NAOTSUGU] SERIOUSLY?! HO HO!

348
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,031
IS IT THAT SURPRISING?

349
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,232
[NAOTSUGU]
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?!

350
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,735
I MEAN, YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE A LITTLE‐

351
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,904
AAH! AAH!

352
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,438
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD...
[SHIROE] SHE'S IN COLLEGE?

353
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,508
[AKATSUKI] MAY I INFLICT GREAT
PAIN UPON NAOTSUGU'S FACE?

354
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:18,411
I REALLY NEED YOU
TO TELL ME BEFORE YOU
DO IT NEXT TIME, OK?!

355
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:22,048
[AKATSUKI] IT'S YOUR FAULT
FOR BEING A DISGUSTING PIG!

356
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,617
"DISGUSTING"?

357
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:27,220
OH. I'LL SHOW‐ AAH! OH!

358
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,756
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, I THINK
HIS FACE MIGHT NEED MORE BLOOD.

359
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:30,924
[NAOTSUGU]
EVERY SINGLE TIME...

360
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,392
AT LEAST LET ME
FINISH SAYING IT.

361
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,529
[SHIROE] YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE HIM CRY, YOU KNOW?

362
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,064
UH, MY LORD, DON'T TELL
ME THAT YOU WERE ALSO

363
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,901
THINKING I WAS JUST A
KID IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

364
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,670
[SHIROE] UH, WELL, NO,
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR,

365
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,607
BUT, UM, UH...

366
00:16:46,707 --> 00:16:48,408
UH...

367
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,012
THAT REMINDS ME...

368
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:58,084
[SHIROE, THINKING]
IT LOOKED LIKE THEY
HAD JOINED SOME GUILD.

369
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,986
I WONDER IF THEY'RE OK.

370
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,156
I DEFINITELY NEED TO
LOOK THEM UP WHEN I
GET BACK TO AKIHABARA.

371
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:05,091
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, ARE YOU
WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING?

372
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,094
[SHIROE] UH... UH,
NOTHING. SORRY.

373
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,596
[AKATSUKI]
THAT ISN'T TRUE.

374
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,866
WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
YOUR FOREHEAD GETS CRINKLY.

375
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,601
[SHIROE] HUH?
[AKATSUKI] RIGHT UP HERE.

376
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,102
YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE AN OLD MAN.

377
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,039
[NAOTSUGU]
OH, BURN! HA HA HA!

378
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,641
[SHIROE]
WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?!

379
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:22,676
[NAOTSUGU] HOW COULD YOU HEAR ME
WITHOUT YOUR HEARING AID?

380
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:23,877
HA HA HA!

381
00:17:23,977 --> 00:17:25,278
[SHIROE] NAOTSUGU!
[NAOTSUGU] HA HA HA!

382
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,313
(SAND AND ROCKS GRATING)

383
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:28,314
[ALL] OH!

384
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,784
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT'S THIS?

385
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,619
SERVER LAG?

386
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,020
[SHIROE]
NO. THAT ISN'T IT.

387
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,856
WE SWITCHED ZONES.

388
00:17:35,956 --> 00:17:37,057
[AKATSUKI]
MY LORD, WATCH OUT.

389
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,258
[SHIROE] UH!

390
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,425
[NAOTSUGU]
WHAT IS THAT THING?

391
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,662
IT'S TOTALLY
BLOCKING THE STAIRS.

392
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:43,429
IS THAT IN THE GAME?

393
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,899
[SHIROE]
A SUBSPECIES OF RAT‐MAN?

394
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,034
THE HUD DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING ON IT.

395
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,570
[AKATSUKI]
WHICH MEANS...

396
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,173
[NAOTSUGU] IT MUST BE ONE OF
THE NEW NOVASPHERE MONSTERS.

397
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,910
[SHIROE] IT'S HUGE,
BUT IT'S LEVEL 68.

398
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,513
IT LOOKS LIKE A GIANT
MASS OF DEBUFFS.

399
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:02,649
[AKATSUKI] IS IT THE REASON
THE DUNGEON'S FALLING APART?

400
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,017
[SHIROE] PROBABLY.

401
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,853
IT'S A LITTLE RISKY,
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

402
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,054
TAKE IT OUT.

403
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:09,255
[NAOTSUGU]
ALL RIGHT!

404
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,324
LET'S MAKE THIS QUICK,
STRATEGY MAN!

405
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,659
[AKATSUKI] HUH!
[SHIROE] UH!

406
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,695
[NAOTSUGU] I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU, RAT FACE!

407
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,229
(SHIMMER)

408
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,699
UH! UH!

409
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,401
[AKATSUKI]
STEALTH BLADE!

410
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,337
[NAOTSUGU]
CROSS SLASH!

411
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,906
[SHIROE] NO MATTER
HOW GOOD YOU ARE,

412
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,674
FIGHTING LIKE THIS
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT!

413
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,811
[NAOTSUGU] NO KIDDING! YOU CAN'T
REPRODUCE THE SIZE OF THIS THING

414
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,848
OR ITS BAD BREATH WITH A
MONITOR AND A SET OF SPEAKERS!

415
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,650
COME ON!

416
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:41,054
[SHIROE]
THORN BIND HOSTAGE!

417
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:43,056
[NAOTSUGU] NICE!

418
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,158
[AKATSUKI] UH!

419
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,963
[NAOTSUGU] LOOKS LIKE IT HAS
A HIGH SHIELD RATING.

420
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,898
BUT WE STILL
HAVE 3 VINES LEFT.

421
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,299
SIC 'EM, STUMPY!

422
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,602
DON'T CALL ME THAT!

423
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,571
[NAOTSUGU] UH!

424
00:18:57,671 --> 00:19:00,473
[SHIROE] LET'S MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T MISS.

425
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,142
MIND SHOCK!

426
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,311
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
ADD A CONFUSION DEBUFF

427
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,548
THAT LOWERS ACCURACY
AND AGILITY.

428
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,884
NEXT, AMPLIFY THE ATTACK POWER
OF YOUR ALLIES' WEAPONS.

429
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,285
(NAOTSUGU SCREAMS)

430
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,925
[SHIROE] KEEN EDGE.

431
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,026
[AKATSUKI]
THANKS FOR THAT.

432
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,294
GOING IN!

433
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:24,865
ONE MORE HIT AND
WE'RE DONE WITH THIS!

434
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,770
ASSASSINATION!

435
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,473
[NAOTSUGU] HUH! HUH.

436
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:58,832
[SHIROE] AWESOME.

437
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,100
[AKATSUKI]
THE WIND IS COLD.

438
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,968
[NAOTSUGU] AH HA HA!
BUT IT FEELS GREAT.

439
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:07,307
I THINK IT'S SAFE
TO SAY THE HARD
PART'S BEHIND US.

440
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,175
[AKATSUKI] IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

441
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,578
[NAOTSUGU] IT'S AMAZING.

442
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,015
[KANAMI] THE BEST PART
ABOUT ADVENTURES

443
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,684
IS ALL THE NEW EXPERIENCES.

444
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,953
HMM.

445
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,888
[SHIROE]
EXPERIENCES, HUH?

446
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,123
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

447
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,125
[SHIROE] WHEN THIS
WAS JUST A GAME,

448
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,028
A LOT OF PLAYERS CAME
TO THIS SPOT AT DAWN

449
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:30,731
AND SAW IT ON A MONITOR.

450
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:37,504
BUT NOW WE'RE THE FIRST
ONES TO MAKE IT HERE.

451
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,974
SERIOUSLY, WE'RE
THE FIRST ADVENTURERS

452
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,544
TO ACTUALLY LIVE THIS.

453
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,979
[NAOTSUGU] HMM.

454
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,081
[SHIROE] HMM.

455
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,616
[NAOTSUGU]
YEAH. GUESS WE ARE.

456
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,452
YOU KNOW, ELDER TALES
HAD GREAT ARTWORK AND ALL,

457
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:54,921
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.

458
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,489
[AKATSUKI] I KNOW.

459
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:59,893
IT'S LIKE THE FIRST THING WE'VE
EARNED BY WINNING A BATTLE.

460
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,063
(FIRE ROARS)

461
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:06,466
(SHIVERING)

462
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:07,734
[THUG 1] DID YOU REALLY THINK

463
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,503
YOU WERE GETTING OUT
OF SUSUKINO THAT EASY?

464
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,938
[THUG 2] YOU'VE GOT TO BE
THE WORLD'S BIGGEST MORON

465
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,674
OR JUST INCREDIBLY STUPID.

466
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:14,575
[TRAVELLER] NO!

467
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,842
(SLAM)
[THUG 3] FOR A BIG WAGON,

468
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,343
I WAS HOPING FOR A
BETTER HAUL THAN THIS.

469
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,279
WHAT ARE YOU
STANDING THERE FOR?

470
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,181
GET BUSY, WILL YOU?

471
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,950
[TOMTOM] I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

472
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,185
[THUG 5] FINE.

473
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,121
THEN YOU'RE HEADED
FOR THE CATHEDRAL.

474
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,990
[TOMTOM] DEMICAS?

475
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,058
UH!

476
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:35,228
[DEMICAS] HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

477
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:37,463
DO WHAT I SAY, OR
YOU GET DEALT WITH.

478
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:39,232
[LONDARK] DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL COME BACK TO LIFE.

479
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,201
IF PEOPLE STILL GET
UPSET OVER PKING,

480
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:43,203
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THEM.

481
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,437
[DEMICAS] HEY, GET ALL HIS GEAR

482
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:47,107
BEFORE HE DISAPPEARS
ON US, GUYS!

483
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:48,775
[MEN] RIGHT!

484
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,043
(METAL RATTLING)

485
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,078
BETTER NOT
DROP THAT.

486
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:53,313
[THUG 1] YOU HEARD HIM, NPC.

487
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,748
[THUG 2] YEAH. TAKE
CARE OF OUR STUFF.

488
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:55,949
HUH?

489
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,651
[THUG 3] FOUND SOME MORE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND, BOSS.

490
00:21:57,751 --> 00:21:59,052
(NPCS CRYING)
YOU THINK THEY MIGHT
KNOW ANYTHING

491
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,754
ABOUT THE GUYS
WE'RE LOOKING FOR?

492
00:22:00,854 --> 00:22:04,390
HUH. NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS
ARE CRYING NOW.

493
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,492
THAT WASN'T PART OF
THE GAME BEFORE.

494
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,428
[LONDARK]
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

495
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:10,797
[THUG] SHOULD WE TAKE
THEM OUT, GUILD MASTER?

496
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,432
(GIRLS SCREAMING)
[DEMICAS] IF YOU WANT.

497
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,001
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND OR NOT.

498
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,770
THEY DON'T INTEREST ME.

499
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:19,472
ALL RIGHT, LONDARK.

500
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:22,375
WHAT ABOUT THE CAT
AND THE HEALER GIRL?

501
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,344
I HAVE MEN
LOOKING FOR THEM.

502
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,646
NOTHING YET.

503
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:26,780
UGH...

504
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,049
[DEMICAS] HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA JACK AROUND?!

505
00:22:29,149 --> 00:22:30,250
YOU NEED TO BE OUT THERE

506
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,018
FINDING THAT GIRL
AND THAT CAT FREAK!

507
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,186
[MEN] YES, SIR!

508
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:34,287
(MEN PANTING)

509
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,389
[DEMICAS]
THIS IS MY WORLD NOW.

510
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,159
AND ANYONE WHO
DEFIES ME WILL PAY.

511
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:40,360
HA HA HA!

512
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,162
I'M COMING TO GET YOU

513
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:44,464
AND YOUR DAMN CAT!

514
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:18,759
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
BRIGANDIA IS A GUILD THAT
RUNS SUSUKINO WITH FORCE.

515
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:22,362
ITS GUILD MASTER DEMICAS
REIGNS WITH FEAR.

516
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:26,667
SHIROE'S PARTY MEETS
WITH SERARA AND TRIES
TO ESCAPE THEM.

517
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,735
WHAT STRATEGY DOES
SHIROE IMPLEMENT,

518
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:32,205
AND WHAT DOES AKATSUKI
SEE DURING THE BATTLE?

519
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,976
[SHIROE]
THIS IS OUR REALITY.
