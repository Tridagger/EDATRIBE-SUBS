1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:08,842
[SHIROE] ALL OF THESE
ALTERCATIONS HAVE HAPPENED
IN THE SPAN OF ONLY 2 DAYS.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,778
IT'S TOO MANY TO JUST
BE A COINCIDENCE.

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,046
[HENRIETTA] BUT WHY?

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,348
WHY WOULD SOMEONE WANT
TO ATTACK AKIHABARA?

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,683
[SHIROE] HM.

6
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,785
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SPREADING
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY

7
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:22,222
TO CAUSE MINOR DISTURBANCES
AND START GROUNDLESS RUMORS.

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,025
I'D SAY THEIR GOAL
SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE...

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:29,362
TO DESTROY THE REPUTATION
OF THE ROUND TABLE.

10
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,392
[KARASHIN] THEN I
GUESS I WAS RIGHT.

11
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,762
[MINORI] YEAH, AND SHIROE
THINKS THE SAME THING, TOO.

12
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,396
AN ATTACK...

13
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:13,634
THE TRANSIENT 15% OF
THE CURRENT POPULATION

14
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,503
HAS CAUSED OVER
60% OF THE PROBLEMS.

15
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,105
SO YOU'RE SAYING THEY ACTUALLY
DELIBERATELY TURNED IN

16
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:21,875
FAULTY PAPERWORK
JUST TO CONFUSE US?

17
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,277
[MINORI] THE GUILDS
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO
BE PROVIDING SECURITY

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,081
ARE SO BUSY DEALING WITH
THIS SUDDEN OUTBREAK OF
BICKERING AND PETTY PROBLEMS,

19
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,550
THEY CAN'T DO
THEIR REAL JOBS.

20
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,517
WELL, GOOD GRIEF!

21
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,687
WHO DO YOU THINK'S
BEHIND THIS?

22
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,790
(ELISSA SIGHS)
[ELISSA] I KNOW THIS MAY NOT
BE A NICE THING TO SAY,

23
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,827
BUT IF THIS WERE
MERELY A BANQUET TO
THANK THE ADVENTURERS,

24
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,429
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT YOU'D HAVE
TO GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

25
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,667
YOU GET FURTHER WITH POLITENESS
THAN WITH PAGEANTRY.

26
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:50,170
[RAYNESHIA] YES, BUT WHY IS LORD
MARVESS CHOOSING TO SHOW UP NOW?

27
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,438
DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

28
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,075
WITH THE REVOLUTION THAT'S
BEEN BREWING UP IN THE WEST?

29
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,877
I DON'T KNOW.

30
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,244
[ELISSA] EITHER WAY,

31
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,113
HE REALLY ISN'T SOMEONE
WE CAN SIMPLY TURN AWAY,

32
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,347
NOW, IS HE?

33
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,884
[RAYNESHIA]
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
I KNOW.

34
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:04,851
IT'S JUST THAT‐

35
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,986
[ELISSA] WHAT IS IT?

36
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:08,121
I'VE GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

37
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,391
WELL, SO LONG AS WE
REMEMBER THAT THE GOAL
OF TONIGHT'S BANQUET

38
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,227
IS TO DEEPEN OUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE ADVENTURERS.

39
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,696
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

40
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:17,664
AND I WILL DO MY BEST TO
BE BOTH CORDIAL AND POLITE

41
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,265
TO LORD MARVESS.

42
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:23,570
BUT THAT'S IT. DON'T EXPECT
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

43
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,680
[ISAAC] AND THAT'S IT.
SOUNDS LIKE A BIG DEAL, HUH?

44
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,415
[SHIROE] THANKS FOR
THE LATEST INFO.

45
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,950
ALL RIGHT KEEP UP
THE GOOD WORK.

46
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,719
I TAKE IT THAT
WAS ISAAC.

47
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,120
YEAH, IT WAS.

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,756
[SHIROE] HE SAID A HIGH RANKING
WESTELANDIAN MERCHANT NOBLEMAN

49
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:47,493
NAMED LORD MARVESS HAS JUST
NOW ARRIVED IN THE CITY.

50
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,395
IS THAT A PROBLEM,
MY LORD?

51
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,165
WELL, LET ME SEE IF
I CAN EXPLAIN IT.

52
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:57,037
[SHIROE] I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND ARE TRYING TO
ATTACK OUR CREDIBILITY.

53
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,238
[AKATSUKI]
"PEOPLE OF THE LAND"?

54
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,640
[HENRIETTA] WHY WOULD
THEY DO THAT?

55
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
[SHIROE] IN THE ORIGINAL
"ELDER TALES,"

56
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,110
THERE WERE NEVER ANY QUESTS
THAT INVOLVED AN ATTEMPT

57
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,212
TO REMOVE SOMEONE
FROM POWER.

58
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,216
AND IT ISN'T SOMETHING
ADVENTURERS WOULD EVER
NEED TO CONSIDER, RIGHT?

59
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,519
BESIDES, IT DOESN'T EVEN
SOUND LIKE IT WOULD BE

60
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,688
A VERY FUN QUEST ANYWAY.

61
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,089
NO, IT DOESN'T.

62
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,824
AND SO YOU BELIEVE THIS
WESTELAND NOBLEMAN

63
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,093
IS ULTIMATELY THE ONE
WHO'S TRYING TO DESTROY

64
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,395
THE ROUND TABLE'S
REPUTATION?

65
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,667
[SHIROE] WELL, GIVEN THE VAST
NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF THE LAND
INVOLVED IN THE DISTURBANCES,

66
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,370
THE ODDS ARE RELATIVELY
HIGH THAT SOMEONE IMPORTANT
IS RUNNING THINGS.

67
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,006
AT LEAST, THAT'S
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

68
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,042
[SHIROE] AND I DON'T SEE
ANYTHING THAT WOULD LEAD
ME TO THINK OTHERWISE.

69
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,945
[HENRIETTA] THEN OUR ADVERSARY
IS COMING FROM THE WEST.

70
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,582
[SHIROE] DON'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE.

71
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,684
[HENRIETTA] BUT I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY ON EARTH HE

72
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,052
WOULD WANT UNDERMINE
THE ROUND TABLE.

73
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,522
[SHIROE] IT'S ONLY
ONE STEP IN A PLAN.

74
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,423
THE END GAME MUST
BE GREATER.

75
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,826
HE PROBABLY WANTS TO TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE CONFUSION

76
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,928
IN ORDER TO INTERFERE WITH
THE TREATY BETWEEN EASTAL

77
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,097
AND THE ROUND TABLE.

78
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:00,466
HE DOESN'T WANT EASTAL TO
MONOPOLIZE ALL THE BENEFITS.

79
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,168
[HENRIETTA] WE NEED
TO ACT QUICKLY, THEN.

80
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,171
SHOULD WE CANCEL THE FESTIVAL
BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND?

81
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,542
[SHIROE] I DON'T THINK
WE NEED TO DO THAT.
[HENRIETTA] AH...

82
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,176
[SHIROE] IF WE SUDDENLY
CANCEL THE FESTIVAL,

83
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,714
THEN IT CALLS INTO QUESTION OUR
ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

84
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,282
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS.

85
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,119
INSTEAD, OUR BEST MOVE'S
PROBABLY TO JUST MINIMIZE

86
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,854
THE DAMAGE AND
WAIT THINGS OUT.

87
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,956
[HENRIETTA] AND HOW DO
WE DO THAT, SHIROE?

88
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,858
[SHIROE] WELL, WE MUST ASSUME
THAT THEY HAVE AT LEAST

89
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,494
ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY
OF A COUNTERATTACK.

90
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,498
LET'S GIVE THEM ONE,
SHALL WE?

91
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,968
[SHIROE] AHH! EASY, AKATSUKI.
PUT THOSE AWAY.

92
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,971
[AKATSUKI] BUT, MY LORD,
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT, RIGHT?

93
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,540
[SHIROE] NO, NO!

94
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,776
I DIDN'T MEAN WE'D GO OUT AND
START CHOPPING PEOPLE UP, OK?

95
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,779
THIS TIME, WE WON'T
BE NEEDING THOSE.

96
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,614
(AKATSUKI GROANS)

97
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,051
[NAOTSUGU] REPORT TO YOU?
[SHIROE, VOICE‐CHAT] YES.

98
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,587
JUST KEEP ME CONSTANTLY INFORMED
ABOUT WHAT SORT OF PROBLEMS

99
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,422
POP UP AND WHERE THEY ARE, OK?

100
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,158
[NAOTSUGU] YOU GOT IT, BOSS MAN.

101
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,028
BUT, WAIT. I THOUGHT
ISAAC AND HIS BUDDIES
WERE ON DISTURBANCE DUTY.

102
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,331
[SHIROE] WE HAVE MORE
GROUND TO COVER THAN
I ORIGINALLY EXPECTED.

103
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,700
IT'S GOTTEN
MORE COMPLICATED.

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,635
SO IN ORDER TO SET UP
NEW CHAINS OF COMMAND

105
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,037
AND BRING IN MORE
PERSONNEL EFFICIENTLY,

106
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,873
I'M GONNA NEED
MORE INFORMATION.

107
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,208
[NAOTSUGU] CAN WE ASK THE
OTHER GUILDS TO HELP US OUT?

108
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,444
[SHIROE] IF THEY KNEW THE
ROUND TABLE WAS CONCERNED
ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION,

109
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,281
IT WOULD GIVE THE ENEMY
EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT.

110
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,383
SO WE NEED TO FIGURE
OUT WHO'S AVAILABLE

111
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,985
AND GET THEM TO HELP
WITHOUT THEM KNOWING

112
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,352
THAT THEY'RE HELPING.

113
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,655
SOUND ABOUT RIGHT,
STRATEGY MAN?

114
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,591
[SHIROE]
YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

115
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,192
[AKATSUKI] AND THAT'S
THE SITUATION.

116
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,294
PLEASE KEEP
US INFORMED.

117
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,196
[TOYA] ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'M ON MY WAY OUT.

118
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,998
[MINORI] OK.

119
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,067
[KARASHIN] SORRY YOUR
BROTHER GOT DRAGGED INTO
HELPING US OUT WITH THIS.

120
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,505
[MINORI] WELL, SHIROE'S
THE ONE WHO GAVE HIM THE ORDERS.
[TOYA] CLAIM CHECKS... CHECKS...

121
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,640
HE DID? TO MAKE
THINGS EASIER FOR US?

122
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,511
NOT EXACTLY.
I DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

123
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:54,247
[SHIROE] YEAH, IT MIGHT BE
BETTER IF YOU MET UP WITH TOYA.

124
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,716
THAT'S ABOUT IT, I THINK.

125
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,819
[MINORI] HUH? SO, UM, IS THAT
ALL YOU NEED FROM ME?

126
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,488
SHIROE, IF IT'S REALLY TRUE
THAT WE'RE UNDER ATTACK,

127
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,891
THEN ISN'T THERE
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO?

128
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,694
[SHIROE] THAT'S ALL.
THANKS, MINORI.

129
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,464
[MINORI, THINKING] I THINK
SHIROE WAS TELLING ME TO DO

130
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,900
WHATEVER I THINK IS
BEST FOR THE SITUATION.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,838
HE'S ENCOURAGING ME TO
MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS ABOUT
HOW TO HELP OUR MISSION.

132
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,306
[TARO] HEY, GUYS, I JUST GOT
ANOTHER BATCH IN FROM THE SOUTH!

133
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:23,076
[MINORI] IF YOU'RE WORKING ON
THE REFUND FOR THE POTATOES,

134
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,210
I'VE GOT A FEW MORE.

135
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,346
[KARASHIN] I'M ON IT.

136
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,381
[MINORI, THINKING]
I MAY BE WRONG ABOUT THIS,

137
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,316
BUT IF THAT'S TRUE...

138
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,252
IF IT'S REALLY TRUE...

139
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,187
IF SHIROE WAS
COUNTING ON ME,

140
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,056
EVEN IF ONLY A
LITTLE BIT...

141
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,058
THEN I'M...
THEN I'LL‐

142
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,560
(THUD)
OH.

143
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,427
[TARO] MINORI, I'M SORRY,
BUT I ALSO HAVE THESE.

144
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,231
[MINORI] WHOA. SO WAIT. ARE
THESE ALL CLAIM CHECKS FOR
LUGGAGE?

145
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,601
[TARO] YEAH, WE JUST KEEP
GETTING MORE AND MORE WORK.

146
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,003
THE REAL DEAL'S
ABOUT TO START.

147
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,237
[MINORI] ALL RIGHT.

148
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,339
THEN I SHALL OUR DEFEND OUR
REAR LINE TO THE DEATH.

149
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,141
[KARASHIN AND TARO] HUH?

150
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,712
[MINORI, THINKING]
SHIROE HAS TAUGHT ME THE
FUNDAMENTALS OF HOW TO FIGHT.

151
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:04,417
FORMATION, OPERATOR,
FIELD MONITOR, PATROL FILE.

152
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,253
WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THE FRONT LINE SHOULD DO?

153
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:11,858
AND WHAT ABOUT THE HEALER?
AND WHAT ABOUT THE REAR LINE?

154
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,762
[MAN 1] I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY...
[TOYA] OVER HERE! HEY, GUYS.
HEY, I'M WITH THE COUNCIL!

155
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,463
I'VE COME TO PICK UP
THE CLAIM CHECKS!

156
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:20,867
BACK HERE! I'M WITH
THE COUNCIL! HEY!

157
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,036
[MAN 2] WE'RE CUSTOMERS,
YOU KNOW!
[TOYA] THIS IS SO BAD!

158
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,171
[TOYA] IT REALLY IS A WAR!
[MAN 2] JEEZ, HOW LONG
DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?

159
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,407
[MINORI] THE PEOPLE WORKING
AT THE WAREHOUSE DESK

160
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,511
FIELDING THE ONSLAUGHT
OF COMPLAINTS...

161
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,979
THEY ARE OUR FRONT LINE.

162
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,114
[KARASHIN] RIGHT.

163
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,849
THE BASEMENT OF
WAREHOUSE 3.

164
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,417
[KARASHIN] ARE YOU
KIDDING ME?

165
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,319
[TARO] UH...
[KARASHIN] OK, THANKS.

166
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,854
I'LL SEND YOU THE VOUCHERS
AS SOON AS I CAN...
[TARO] I AM FREAKING OUT, MAN.

167
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,322
[MINORI, THINKING]
KARASHIN AND HIS FRIENDS

168
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,757
ARE DEALING WITH THE
OVERFLOW OF PROBLEMS

169
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,559
THE OTHERS
CAN'T HANDLE.

170
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,894
THEY ARE OUR HEALERS.

171
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,631
AND AS THEIR REAR LINE, IT'S
MY DUTY TO SUPPORT THEM ALL

172
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,232
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

173
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,067
(BOXES FALLING)
[TARO AND KARASHIN] WOAH!
[CAT MAN] SORRY...

174
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,570
[TARO] YOU FREAKING IDIOT!
THOSE TOOK FOREVER TO ORGANIZE!

175
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,904
[CAT PERSON] WHAT'S WITH YOU?!
[TARO] WHAT'S WITH YOU?!

176
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,773
[KARASHIN] HEY, HEY,
HEY. EASY.

177
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,642
[MINORI] IT'S ALL
RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
[ALL THREE] HUH?

178
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,845
[MINORI] ACCIDENTS HAPPEN,
BUT WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR HEADS.

179
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,547
GETTING ANGRY
STOPS THE FLOW.

180
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,181
AND STOPPING THE
FLOW HURTS US.

181
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,916
[KARASHIN] "THE FLOW"?

182
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:13,419
UH, YEAH, SHIROE TOLD ME
WE NEED IT IN EVERY FIGHT.

183
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,357
[MINORI] AND THE FLOW OF
BATTLE ISN'T SOMETHING
YOU LEARN OR READ.

184
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,560
IT'S SOMETHING YOU BECOME.

185
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,228
[KARASHIN] OK, I FEEL
A BIT BETTER.

186
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,299
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHIROE
HIMSELF IS HERE WITH US.

187
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,502
OH, NOT REALLY.

188
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:31,505
[KARASHIN] ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS. BECOME THE FLOW!

189
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,106
[BOTH] WHOO‐HOO!

190
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,909
[MINORI, THINKING] I'VE LEARNED
SO MANY TACTICS, TECHNIQUES,

191
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,979
AND GAINED SO MUCH
KNOWLEDGE FROM SHIROE.

192
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,915
BUT SOMEDAY, SOMEDAY
SOON, I HOPE...

193
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:45,085
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
SOMETHING BACK TO HIM.

194
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,486
[AKATSUKI] WHAT?

195
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,254
"THIS POT IS A GOOD
POT"? I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

196
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,723
[HENRIETTA] YES, THE WEST
SIDE OF THE CATHEDRAL.

197
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,857
[SHIROE, THINKING] WHAT IS THIS?

198
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,958
THEY'RE REPEATEDLY
ATTACKING AREAS

199
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,627
THAT HAVE NO
STRATEGIC VALUE...

200
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,228
NO REAL WORTH AT ALL.

201
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,830
[SHIROE] WHAT'S GOING ON?

202
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,231
[HENRIETTA] UM, SHIROE, LOOKS
LIKE ANOTHER CARRIAGE HAS THROWN

203
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,867
A WHEEL, AND IT'S
BLOCKING THE ROAD.

204
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:05,305
[SHIROE] OK, I GOT IT.
THE WEST SIDE OF THE CATHEDRAL?

205
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,641
HM. THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE EITHER.

206
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,342
[HENRIETTA] HUH?

207
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,545
EVEN IF THEY CLOSE OFF
THIS PATHWAY,

208
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,479
THERE ARE STILL PLENTY
OF WAYS AROUND.

209
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,415
AND THERE ARE OTHER
WAYS TO STOP TRAFFIC.

210
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:17,751
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE
ANY REAL POINT TO IT.

211
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,786
[SHIROE, THINKING] THERE MUST
BE SOMETHING MORE TO THIS.

212
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:23,023
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
SOMETHING, BUT WHAT?

213
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,026
[CONSTANTAN] YEAH!
THE ROUND TABLE IS
MAKING OUT LIKE THIEVES!

214
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,493
THEY'RE ILLEGALLY TAKING
MOST OF THE PROFITS

215
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,429
RIGHT OUT FROM
UNDER OUR NOSES.

216
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,466
OH? WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE
SAYING ABOUT OUR ROUND TABLE?

217
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,602
[CONSTANTAN STUTTERS]

218
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,604
[ISAAC] HA! THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

219
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:41,374
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE DEFINITELY TRYING
TO SMEAR OUR REPUTATION.

220
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,243
WHAT'S THE PLAN, VILLAIN?

221
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:46,913
[NYANTA] YEAH. THINGS ARE QUITE
CONFUSED OUT HERE AS WELL.

222
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,916
CLEARLY WE DON'T HAVE THE
RIGHT NUMBER OF PERSONNEL

223
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,718
TO HANDLE ALL THE ISSUES.

224
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,588
[SHIROE] REALLY? I EXPECTED
THINGS TO BE A MESS THERE,

225
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,957
SO I THOUGHT I SENT
A PRETTY FAIR NUMBER.

226
00:10:57,057 --> 00:11:00,260
[NYANTA] THE PROBLEM IS, IS THAT
IT'S TAKEN TOO LONG TO RESOLVE

227
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,328
EACH INDIVIDUAL INCIDENT.

228
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,665
IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL
PEOPLE ARE BEING TIED UP

229
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,333
BEHIND A SINGLE MERCHANT
FOR AN ENTIRE HOUR,

230
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,069
SOMETIMES EVEN MORE.

231
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,173
MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST WAITING
IN LINES, GETTING IRRITATED.

232
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,776
AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE
SO PERSONAL OR CONTRIVED

233
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:19,112
THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
A SOLUTION FOR THEM.

234
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,182
[MAN] I APOLOGIZED, DIDN'T I?
[WOMAN] YOU CALL
THAT AN APOLOGY?

235
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,450
[SHIROE] OH, YOU MEAN
DOMESTIC QUARRELS.

236
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:27,954
[NYANTA] WITH ALL OF THESE
COUPLES AROUND, I GUESS I

237
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,523
EXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

238
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,057
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY.

239
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,227
AND TO BE HONEST,
RELATIONSHIPS, WELL,

240
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:38,164
GAMERS AREN'T VERY GOOD
AT DEALING WITH THAT
SORT OF STUFF, YOU DIG?

241
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,668
[SHIROE] TRUE, I GUESS. BUT
WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHIEF?

242
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:44,304
DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S
ALSO PART OF THE ATTACK?

243
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,140
[NYANTA] ARE YOU ASKING ME?
THAT'S RARE, BABY.

244
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,744
DOES THE VILLAIN BEHIND GLASSES
HAVE SOME UNCERTAINTY?

245
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,513
UH, YEAH.

246
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,515
[NYANTA] LOOK, ANYTHING
YOU DON'T KNOW,

247
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:58,151
I PROBABLY AIN'T GONNA
KNOW EITHER, UNLESS
WE'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

248
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,755
BUT IN THE END, I CAN'T SAY
THAT I SEE ANY UNIFIED PURPOSE

249
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,391
TO ANY OF THEIR ACTIONS.

250
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,360
[SHIROE, THINKING] WHY? THE MORE
I THINK ABOUT IT,

251
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,898
THE LESS CLEARLY I CAN VISUALIZE
THE ENEMY'S OBJECTIVES. FIND IT.

252
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:16,069
THERE HAS TO BE SOME METHOD TO
THIS MADNESS. FIND IT, SHIROE!

253
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,139
THERE MUST BE SOME INTENT BEHIND
THIS SEEMINGLY RANDOM PATTERN!

254
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,008
SHUTTING DOWN TRAFFIC,
SPREADING RUMORS,

255
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,544
AND STARTING
MEANINGLESS DISPUTES,

256
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,180
DELIBERATELY SUBMITTING BAD
PAPERWORK, MINOR TAX FRAUD,

257
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,682
TRYING TO BRIBE US,

258
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:31,451
TYING UP STAFF WITH
COMPLAINTS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

259
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:36,823
IS IT A MULTILAYERED ATTACK
OR ARE THEY JUST MAKING IT
ALL UP AS THEY GO ALONG?

260
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,459
NO. BUT WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?

261
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,062
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE, THE MARINE
AGENCY JUST RECEIVED

262
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:44,297
A HUGE NUMBER OF PIZZAS
THEY DIDN'T ORDER!

263
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,099
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD,
THE COCKROACHES SPOTTED

264
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,368
AT EAT‐TIL‐YOU‐DROP ALLEY
WERE MADE OF RUBBER!

265
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,703
THEY'RE FAKE!

266
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,405
PIZZA? COCKROACHES?

267
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,908
[SHIROE] THIS IS DUMB.

268
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,910
[HENRIETTA] SHIROE?

269
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,279
[SHIROE, THINKING] THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

270
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,782
THEY DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING IN MIND AT ALL.

271
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,385
THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT
ANYTHING. IT'S IRRATIONAL!

272
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,854
EACH OF THEIR ATTACKS IS
COMPLETELY IMPROVISED.

273
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,390
EVERYTHING'S INVENTED
ON THE SPOT!

274
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,626
SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE
STRESS OVER FIXING IT,

275
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,028
IT'S UTTERLY POINTLESS.

276
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,597
I HATE ENEMIES LIKE THESE.

277
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,534
I HATE MEANINGLESS, RANDOM,
SMORGASBORD, CLUTTERED INSANITY!

278
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:25,071
(SCREAMS)

279
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,981
[SHIROE, THINKING]
GET IT TOGETHER, SHIROE.

280
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,883
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING
IF YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

281
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,019
BUT IF YOU DON'T REACT
AND DO SOMETHING PRETTY SOON,

282
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,622
PEOPLE WILL NOTICE
THAT SOMETHING'S UP.

283
00:13:41,722 --> 00:13:46,259
HOW CAN I FIGHT AN ENEMY THAT'S
THIS SPORADIC AND UNPREDICTABLE?

284
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:49,262
WELL, NOW IF IT ISN'T
MASTER SHIROE.

285
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,331
[GUILD MEMBERS]
LONG TIME, NO SEE!

286
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,733
HEY, GUYS.

287
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,568
[SOUJIRO] OH, THE FOLKS
AT THE CAKE BUFFET

288
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,169
WERE REALLY NICE TO US!

289
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:58,238
[GUILD MEMBER] YEAH!
[DOLCE] OH, TOTALLY.

290
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,873
[SHIROE] THEY WERE NICE TO YOU?

291
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:03,009
[SOUJIRO] YEAH! THEY GAVE
ME A TON OF WHOLE CAKES.

292
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,578
(KANAKO GROWLS)
[SOUJIRO] AND IT WAS
WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME,

293
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,480
SO I CALLED IN ALL THE
OTHER GUILD MEMBERS.
[KANAKO] AH!

294
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,115
[GIRLS] "SOUJIRO!"

295
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,984
[KANAKO] CHARGE!
[SOUJIRO] AND EVERY TIME
A NEW MEMBER ARRIVED,

296
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,186
THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH
TO BRING US ANOTHER CAKE.

297
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,456
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SO SURE IF
I'D CALL THAT KINDNESS.

298
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,091
(KANAKO GROANS)
[NAZUNA] WE ATE THEM ALL!

299
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,325
[KAWARA]
GIVE US SOME MORE!

300
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,927
[ISAMI]
I WANT STRAWBERRY
TART, TOO.

301
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,129
[DOLCE] YOU WANT SOME
MORE, SWEET CHEEKS?

302
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,567
BY THE TIME WE HAD 30 OR SO,
SHE SAID SHE WAS OUT.

303
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,135
[SHIROE] HUH?!
[SOUJIRO] WHAT?

304
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,604
[SHIROE, THINKING] HE KEPT
BRINGING MORE PEOPLE,

305
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,172
AND THEY KEPT
BRINGING MORE CAKES

306
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,074
UNTIL THEY RAN
OUT OF CAKE?

307
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:37,143
HE FOUGHT THEM OFF BY BRINGING
IN A BUNCH OF... GIRLS?

308
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,680
[SOUJIRO] THE ORANGE MOUSSE
WAS REALLY SOMETHING SPECIAL.

309
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,382
LIKE A LINGERING
SCENT OF SUMMER.

310
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,617
[GROUP] YEAH!

311
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,152
[SHIROE, THINKING] IN REALITY,
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

312
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,189
THE PERFECT COUNTERATTACK TO
THE CAKE GIRL'S SINISTER PLANS.

313
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,957
AND SINCE HE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

314
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,159
HE WAS KIND OF
INVINCIBLE IN A WAY.

315
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:58,632
[SHIROE] WAIT! HEY, YOU GUYS
CAME AT THE PERFECT TIME! HA HA!

316
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,834
[SOUJIRO] ARE YOU OK, SHIROE?

317
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,570
(GIRLS FAWNING)
[SHIROE] I THINK I HAVE
THE PERFECT JOB FOR YOU.

318
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,605
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

319

HUH?

320

(GUILD MEMBERS LAUGHING)

321
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:10,443
[SHIROE, THINKING] I'VE GOT
THE ANSWER. I'VE GOT THE
ANSWER RIGHT HERE.

322
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:13,780
I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF
OBLIVIOUSNESS THAT CAN
BEAT THEIR RANDOMNESS.

323
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,448
[GUILD MEMBERS]
YOU ARE SCARING US.

324
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:17,884
[DOLCE] OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU ARE
SO SCARY, I CAN'T EVEN STAND IT!

325
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,220
(LAUGHTER)

326
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,288
[RAYNESHIA] AND, FURTHERMORE,
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU,

327
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,691
BOTH MAIHAMA AND
EASTAL WERE SAVED.

328
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,528
I CANNOT EXPRESS
MY GRATITUDE ENOUGH.

329
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,663
[ADVENTURER 1] NO, NO.
NO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

330
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,298
AS ADVENTURERS, IT'S OUR
JOB TO DO STUFF LIKE THAT.

331
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,034
[ADVENTURER 2]
WE GOT PAID AFTER ALL.

332
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,169
[ADVENTURER 3] IT WAS
NOTHING, REALLY. HEH HEH.

333
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,805
THEY'RE ALL BLUSHING
LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN.

334
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,375
BUT IT IS RATHER REFRESHING
INSTEAD OF BEING FLATTERED
OR FAWNED OVER

335
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,210
FOR NO REASON OTHER
THAN MY STATUS.

336
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,846
(ASSISTANT WHISPERING)
[RAYNESHIA] OH?

337
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:48,849
[ELISSA] PRINCESS, WE'VE JUST
RECEIVED WORD THAT LORD MARVESS

338
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,384

APPEARANCE VERY SOON.

339
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,452
[RAYNESHIA] OK.

340
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,920
[ELISSA] HE'S ARRIVED
WITH A SHIP CARRYING

341
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,557
AN EXTREMELY LARGE
AMOUNT OF CARGO.

342
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,824
AND, UNFORTUNATELY...

343
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,026
[RAYNESHIA] IS THERE A PROBLEM?

344
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,862
[ELISSA] THIS HAS ALL
DEVELOPED SO SUDDENLY.

345
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,496
AND THERE'S MUCH MORE
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

346
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,331
AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DEALT WITH IN ADVANCE.

347
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,233
(CROWD GASPING)
[RAYNESHIA] AH?

348
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,635
[CAT ADVENTURER]
WHO'S THE FREAKY GUY?

349
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,436
[ADVENTURER WITH GOATEE]
MAYBE HE'S A NOBLEMAN.

350
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,005
[ADVENTURER WITH SPIKY HAIR]
HE HAS ADVENTURERS GUARDING HIM.

351
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,473
WHERE IS HE FROM?

352
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:15,241
[CAT ADVENTURER] IS THIS
LIKE A QUEST OR SOMETHING?

353
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,043
'CAUSE HE SEEMS SORT
OF A BIG SHOT.

354
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,581
[MARVESS] OH, WELL, NOW,
HOW DELIGHTFULLY LOVELY!

355
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:26,119
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
YOU MUST BE THE MUCH
LAUDED COWEN GIRL, YES?

356
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,754
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA, IS IT NOT?

357
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,823
[RAYNESHIA] THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO THE BANQUET

358

[MARVESS CHORTLING]

360
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,929
[MARVESS] I'M ABSOLUTELY TICKLED
TO SEE IT SO SUCCESSFUL!

361
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,964
BUT IT WOULD SEEM
TO BE ENCUMBERED

362
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,601
BY QUITE A LACK OF ORDER.
[RAYNESHIA] AH...

363

[MARVESS] I NOTICE A RABBLE
OF COMMONERS ATTENDING THE
SAME BANQUET AS NOBLES.

UNIQUE TO YOU EASTERN PEOPLE

THE MERCHANT GOD'S BLOOD

[ADVENTURER IN FUR HAT]
EASY THERE, OLD TIMER.

368
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,447
LET'S HAVE A TOAST, OK?

UP YOUR PARTY.

BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.

YOU WITH SOME EASTERN SAKE,

381
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,506

LIKING, OF COURSE.

[EIJIRO] ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT HERE?

YOU DO KNOW WHAT
THAT WOULD MEAN, RIGHT?

I WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO PREPARE

AND CHATTELS AT ONCE.

WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR SEAFOOD
TO LOSE ITS FRESHNESS

391

BEFORE THE FESTIVAL,
NOW, CAN WE?

392
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,098
[RAYNESHIA] ABSOLUTELY. I WILL
SPEAK TO SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY.

393

TO SOMEONE! WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I'VE SENT ALL THE
APPROPRIATE PAPERWORK.

AND I RECEIVED APPROPRIATE
CORRESPONDENCE IN RETURN.

398
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,814
UNBELIEVABLE.

399
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,416
I WAS ASSURED YOU WOULD BE
PREPARED TO RECEIVE ME.

400
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:05,519
I HAVE BROUGHT THE FINEST
QUALITY MERCHANDISE

00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:12,793
THEY MUSTN'T BE TREATED WITH
THOUGHTLESS OR CARELESS HASTE.

403

DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

404

[DOLCE] I'VE GOT 5
MORE LOVELIES FOR YOU.

THEY'RE ALL SPIFFIED UP AND
READY FOR THE FRONT LINES!

414
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,751
[SHIROE] UH, WHERE'S SOUJIRO?

415
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,452
[BLONDE WOMAN] SOUJIRO IS
CURRENTLY IN THE TOWN SQUARE

416

ON A HOT, ROMANTIC DATE
WITH 10 DIFFERENT GIRLS, SIR.

417
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,289

[BRUNETTE] SIR, RIGHT NOW,
PLATOON 4 IS CURRENTLY

419
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,760
WITH HIM, SIR!

420
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,629
[SHIROE] OK, THEN LET'S
MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM.

421
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:52,465
PLATOON 4 IS GOING TO
SWITCH OUT WITH PLATOON 5.

422
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,901
AND THEN THEY WILL CONTINUE
TO PATROL THE AREA.

423
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,236
[DOLCE] ROGER, DODGER.

424
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,772
ALL OF US IN PLATOON 5
ARE MOUNTING UP

425
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,441

426
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:03,910
[NYANTA] OH, YEAH, NOW I GET IT.

427
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,782
A GROUP DATE UNDER THE AUSPICES
OF PATROLLING. STRAIGHT PIMPIN'.

428
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,884
[SHIROE] COULD YOU PLEASE
NOT PUT IT THAT WAY?

429
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:15,889
BUT, YEAH, MORE THAN 20 PLATOONS
OF SOUJIRO'S FANGIRLS ARE

430
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,858
ON PATROL ALL OVER AKIHABARA.

431
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,327
IT'S GREAT. THESE GIRLS ARE TIED
BY THE BONDS OF SISTERHOOD.

432
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,530
AND THEY INHERENTLY USE
THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND

433
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,966
TO ORGANICALLY FORM
TACTICAL GROUPS.

434
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:29,870
EACH DEALING WITH
TROUBLE IN A FLEXIBLE AND
BEAUTIFULLY HONEST MANNER.

435
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,138
THEY'RE STOPPING PROBLEMS
BEFORE THEY EVEN START.

436
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:36,409
ON STRATEGIST SHIROE'S
ORDERS, WE'RE HERE TO
SWAP DUTIES WITH YOU!

437
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,345
[PLATOON 4] AW!
[DOLCE] SORRY, LADIES.

438
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,347
[NAZUNA] AND THEIR
MOTIVATION IS PRETTY SIMPLE.

439
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:42,716
BECAUSE IF
THEY PARTICIPATE,

440
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:45,185
THEN THEY GET A CHANCE
TO BE CLOSER TO SOUJIRO.

441
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,553
[ISAAC] IS THAT
SERIOUSLY ALL IT IS?

442
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:48,021
[NYANTA] MM‐HMM.
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

443
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,091
THE PLAN IS A
HUGE SUCCESS.

444
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,059
[SHIROE] YEAH.
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

445
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,963
I WASN'T SURE A PLAN
LIKE THIS HAD ANY CHANCE
OF WORKING SO WELL.

446
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,933
AND ALL WE CAN DO TO FIGHT
THIS EVIL, DASTARDLY ATTACK

447
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,170
IS SEND OUT AS MANY
AWESOME HOT CHICKS AS WE
POSSIBLY CAN. I LOVE IT!

448
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,139
THEIR CHAIN OF COMMAND
IS INDEED SOLID.

449
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,576
THEY'RE DEALING WITH
PROBLEMS IN AN ORGANIZED
AND EFFICIENT MANNER.

450
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,577
[NAZUNA] UH‐HUH!

451
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,579
[GIRL] OH!
[NYANTA] THAT'S RIGHT.

452
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:14,815
IT AIN'T EASY TO CAUSE TROUBLE
WHEN YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY

453
00:20:14,915 --> 00:20:17,551
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
HONEYS. FOR REAL.
[GIRL] AWW!

454
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,520
[NYANTA] AND SINCE THE LADIES
ARE EXPERTS AT ROMANCE,

455
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,287
THEY'RE A NATURAL
FIT TO HANDLE

456
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,724
ALL THOSE PESKY
RELATIONSHIP ISSUES.

457
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,593
[NAOTSUGU] YEAH, I'M
PRETTY SURE I WOULD HAVE
SCREWED THAT UP BIG‐TIME!

458
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,195
THANKS TO SOUJIRO FOR
MAKING THIS THING POSSIBLE.

459
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,031
[NAZUNA] HE REALLY
IS DREAMY, ISN'T HE?

460
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:33,734
[SHIROE] HA HA.
[AKATSUKI] YOU SEEM TO BE
ACTING RATHER ODDLY, MY LORD?

461
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,001
[SHIROE] WELL...

462
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,570
[AKATSUKI] ARE YOU
JEALOUS OR SOMETHING?
[SHIROE] UH!

463
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,605
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?!

464
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:42,208
[NYANTA] I'M NOT SO SURE IF HE'S
JEALOUS. MAYBE MORE ANNOYED.

465
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,144
OR PERHAPS THE WORD
IS "INADEQUATE"?

466
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:48,048
(SHIROE SIGHS)
[ISAAC] WHATEVER YOU CALL IT,
WISH I HAD AN ARMY LIKE THAT.

467
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,016
(LAUGHTER)
[AKATSUKI] HMM?

468
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,685
[ISAMI] EXCUSE ME,
STRATEGIST.

469
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:54,621
I HAVE A MESSAGE FROM
THE SECURITY TEAM AT
WATERMAPLE MANSION.

470
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,122
[SHIROE] THANKS.

471
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:58,458
[KAWARA] THAT'S WHERE
THE PRINCESS IS HOLDING
THE BANQUET, RIGHT?

472
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,026
[AKATSUKI] DID SOMETHING
ELSE HAPPEN?

473
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,928
[SHIROE] I HAD OUR
GUYS LOOK INTO IT.

474
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:05,431
THE BIG SHOT FROM THE WEST
JUST SHOWING UP IN AKIHABARA.

475
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,000
HE MAY BE BEHIND ALL THIS.

476
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,570
[ISAAC] HE'LL BE AFTER THE
PARTY HE'S NEGOTIATING WITH.

477
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,437
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE.

478
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,406
MAYBE AFTER THE
VERY SAME PRINCESS

479
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,876
WHO HAPPENED TO MOVE
HERE FROM MAIHAMA, HMM?

480
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:17,177
[SHIROE] ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.

481
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,212
I'M LEAVING YOU IN CHARGE
HERE FOR A WHILE.

482
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,480
[NYANTA] ROGER THAT.

483
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,282
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
SITUATION HERE, MY LORD?

484
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,686
I HAVE A LITTLE PLAN
FOR THAT, AKATSUKI.

485
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,789
[SHIROE] IF THEIR GOAL IS TO
TEAR THE AKIHABARA PEOPLE APART,

486
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,824
TO CREATE A RIFT
AMONGST EVERYONE HERE,

487
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:33,627
WE JUST NEED TO MAKE THE
SCALE FESTIVAL MORE FUN,

488
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,496
AND ENSURE THAT ALL THE GUESTS
HAVE AS MUCH FUN AS POSSIBLE.

489
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,198
SO IF WE'RE GONNA
DO IT RIGHT,

490
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,534
LET'S SET OFF A
BUNCH OF FIREWORKS.

491
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,703
UH?

492
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:48,174
[ELISSA] WELL, THE DOCUMENTS
ARE LEGITIMATE, PRINCESS.

493
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,744
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW,

494
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:54,915
BUT ALL I CAN GUESS IS
THAT WE SOMEHOW MESSED
UP AND MISSED THEM.

495
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:56,416
WE COULDN'T HAVE.

496
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,919
[MARVESS] SO AM I TO ASSUME
THAT YOU WERE NOT PREPARED,

497
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:01,722
THOUGH I GAVE YOU AMPLE
WARNING OF MY NEEDS?

498
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,090
WELL, GOODNESS
GRACIOUS ME ALIVE!

499
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,861
IS THIS TRULY THE MANNER IN
WHICH THE COWEN FAMILY OPERATES?

500
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:11,765
HONESTLY, IT'S MAKING
ME QUESTION YOUR
FLAWLESS REPUTATION.

501
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:16,903
I MEAN, HOW EVER DID YOU
ESTABLISH SUCH FAVORABLE
RELATIONS WITH AKIHABARA?

502
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,605
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
I JUST NEED TO APOLOGIZE

503
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,240
AND SETTLE THIS
MATTER PEACEFULLY.

504
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,243
OHH, IF ONLY I COULD
POSTPONE THIS ORDEAL

505
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,846
UNTIL AFTER THE BANQUET.

506
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:27,581
[SHIROE] GOOD EVENING.

507
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,915
[RAYNESHIA] AH?
[MARVESS] HM?

508
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,383
[ADVENTURER 1] HE'S WITH
THE ROUND TABLE.

509
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,518
[ADVENTURER 2] YEAH?

510
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,353
[SHIROE] HI THERE.
HOW'S IT GOING?

511
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:36,389
UH, SHIROE?

512
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:38,491
[SHIROE] I'VE COME TO GET YOU,
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

513
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,826
[RAYNESHIA] AH?

514
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,763
[MARVESS] AND JUST WHO
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

515
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,665
A FRIEND OF HERS.

516
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:17,524
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
IT SEEMED THE END WAS NEAR.

517
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,993
BUT, IN FACT, IT WAS
ONLY THE BEGINNING.

518
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:22,563
THE TRUE THREAT APPEARS
BEFORE SHIROE.

519
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,997
THE COAL BLACK QUEEN.

520
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:26,232
A WHITE FLOWER BLOOMING
IN THE DARKNESS.

521
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:31,104
THEIR ENCOUNTER WILL
CHANGE HISTORY AND OPEN
THE CURTAIN ON A NEW STORY.

522
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,206
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

523
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:36,109
[SHIROE] WE WILL
CHANGE THE WORLD.
