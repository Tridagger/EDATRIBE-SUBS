1
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:06,139
[SHIROE] I'VE COME TO GET YOU,
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,074
WHO ARE YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,710
[SHIROE] OH, YES.
MY APOLOGIES.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,313
I'M THE LEADER OF ONE OF
THE ROUND TABLE'S 11 GUILDS.

5
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,115
I AM SHIROE OF LOG HORIZON.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,050
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,451
[MICHITAKA] HELLO THERE.

8
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:21,955
I'M MICHITAKA OF
THE MARINE AGENCY.

9
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:23,690
[KRUSTY] I'M KRUSTY...

10
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,192
OF D. D. D.

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,029
WHAT'S KRUSTY
DOING HERE?

12
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,525
[MARVESS] WHAT DO
YOU WANT, YOUNG MAN?

13
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,627
I'M HAVING AN IMPORTANT
GROWNUP DISCUSSION

14
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,361
WITH THE PRINCESS HERE,
AND I DON'T NEED‐

15
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,496
[SHIROE] THAT'S WHY
WE'RE ALL HERE, AS WELL.

16
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,966
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE
PRINCESS HAS MADE A MISTAKE.

17
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,601
[RAYNESHIA] UH.
[MARVESS] OHH?

18
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,303
[SHIROE] SHE WAS ASKED TO
PREPARE SOME WAREHOUSES FOR YOU,

19
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,140
BUT HAS LOST YOUR LETTER
OR FORGOT IT OR SOMETHING.

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,075
NEVERTHELESS, DUE TO
THIS OVERSIGHT,

21
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,777
IT APPEARS WE
HAVE SOME TROUBLE.

22
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,446
WE HAVE QUITE A PROBLEM
ON OUR HANDS, NOW, DON'T WE?

23
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,014
U‐UH...

24
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,585
[SHIROE] I'M TOLD THAT THE
CARGO CONSISTS PRIMARILY
OF FOOD AND SPICES?

25
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:35,255
AND THAT, IF LEFT OUTSIDE, THAT
THEY'LL SPOIL RATHER QUICKLY.

26
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:39,292
THIS IS QUITE AN ORDEAL
YOU'VE CREATED, PRINCESS.

27
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,727
(RAYNESHIA SIGHS)

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,063
[ELISSA] SHIROE, YOU DON'T
NEED TO PUT IT ALL ON HER.

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,365
[MARVESS] HO HO!
SO AM I TO UNDERSTAND THAT

30
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,368
THIS ROUND TABLE OF
YOURS REPRESENTS AKIHABARA?

31
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,604
WELL, LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT, THEN.

32
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,540
A MISTAKE MADE BY
THE GRANDDAUGHTER
OF EASTAL'S LEADER,

33
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,475
WHO IS THEIR
ALLY OF COURSE,

34
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,512
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR, YES?

35
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,948
UH... THE ROUND TABLE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!

36
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,017
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
AND MINE ALONE!

37
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,586
(CHUCKLE)

38
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,054
[KRUSTY] ACTUALLY, LORD MARVESS,
YOUR LETTER WAS RECEIVED

39
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,156
BY THE ROUND TABLE
SOME TIME AGO.

40
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,391
[MARVESS AND RAYNESHIA] UH!

41
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,294
LET ME SEE THAT!
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

42
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,395
(MARVESS STAMMERS)

43
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,098
WHAT THE‐?
THIS IS MY SIGNATURE!

44
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,265
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

45
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,667
YOU SEEM SURPRISED,
ALMOST AS THOUGH

46
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,336
YOU NEVER EVEN SENT A
LETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

47
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:24,805
(MARVESS CRINGES)

48
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,273
[RAYNESHIA] THEN THAT LETTER...
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,142
[ELISSA] PERHAPS
SHIROE, MILADY.

50
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,779
OH, PISH POSH!
NEVER MIND THE LETTER.
IT'S NOT THE POINT HERE.

51
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
WHAT OF THE WAREHOUSES?
ARE THEY READY OR NOT?

52
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,750
[ELISSA] OH, NO.

53
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,219
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THE
ROUND TABLE'S TRADE WAREHOUSES

54
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,688
ARE ALREADY FULL,
AND HAVE BEEN FOR DAYS.

55
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,891
[MARVESS] MY SHIP HAS 500
TONS OF PERISHABLE CARGO!

56
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:48,328
DO YOU HAVE ANY
WAY FOR ARRANGING A
TEMPERATURE‐CONTROLLED FACILITY

57
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,632
WITH THAT KIND OF
CAPACITY RIGHT NOW?!

58
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,433
UH‐OH. MICHITAKA?

59
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,169
IT IS TRUE THAT THE
WAREHOUSES ARE AT CAPACITY...

60
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,671
UH‐HUH.

61
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,106
[MICHITAKA] WELL,
THE ROUND TABLE'S
WAREHOUSES ANYWAY.

62
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,742
HOWEVER...
[MARVESS] HMM?

63
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,445
THE MARINE AGENCY'S WAREHOUSES
ARE HUGE AND CAN HOLD 5,000 TONS

64
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,548
JUST AS EASILY AS
IT CAN HOLD 500.

65
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:10,116
IF YOU WANT, I'LL LEND
YOU SOME CARTS, TOO.

66
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,417
(MARVESS CRINGES)

67
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,920
[KRUSTY] GREAT. THEN
LET'S MOVE THAT CARGO.

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,288
(MARVESS GRUMBLES)

69
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,357
[KRUSTY]
WAIT, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

70
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,793
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
THERE ISN'T ANY CARGO,

71
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:24,130
THIS WAS ALL JUST A RUSE
MEANT TO EMBARRASS
THE PRINCESS, ARE YOU?

72
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,298
(MARVESS CRINGES)

73
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,701
[KRUSTY] SORRY.
SO PREPOSTEROUS.

74
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,336
A NOBLEMAN OF THE PROUD
HOLY EMPIRE WESTELANDE

75
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,774
WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING SO CHILDISH.

76

[MARVESS] COME NOW!
WE'RE LEAVING!

80
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,448
THESE PEASANTS HAVE
MADE ME FEEL UNWELL!

81
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,885
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)
[RAYNESHIA] UM, KRUSTY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

82
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,788
[KRUSTY] IF YOU WANT TO
THANK SOMEONE, IT'S SHIROE.

83
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,022
HUH?

84
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,424
[SHIROE] IT WAS NOTHING,
JUST A LITTLE SIDE PROJECT.

85
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,394
SO THEN, SHALL WE GO NOW?

86
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,230
UH, WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

87
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,432
[SHIROE] I TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

88
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,568
THAT I'VE COME TO GET YOU.

89
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,904
HUH?

90

(ROARING)

91
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,618
[HENRIETTA] OK, HERE WE GO!

92
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:23,289
WE WILL NOW BEGIN THE AKIHABARA
AUTUMN COLLECTION FASHION SHOW!

94

96
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,666
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS WONDERFUL!

97
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,736
SO MUCH NICER THAN THE
STAGE INSIDE THE BUILDING.

98
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,705
WHAT A SPLENDID IDEA, SHIROE...

99
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,142
AND VERY CLEVER.

100
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,644
OK, NOW, COME
ON, AKATSUKI.

101
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:46,179
GET ON OUT THERE
AND SMILE.

00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,660
(LIGHT SWITCH)
[PATRONS] HUH?

106
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,629
[MAN 1] HEY, IS THAT
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

107
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,431
[MAN 2] IT'S THE
PRINCESS. IT'S HER!

(UNICORNS WHINNY)

109
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,236
[KRUSTY] THERE IS
NO NEED TO KNEEL.

110
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:14,407
TONIGHT, PRINCESS
RAYNESHIA IS HERE TO ENJOY
THE FESTIVAL WITH ALL OF YOU.

111
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,477
TONIGHT, SHE IS A
CITIZEN OF AKIHABARA.

112
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,915
BUT FOR SECURITY REASONS,
SHE MUST NOT LEAVE THE
COMFORT OF THIS COUCH.

113
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:27,320
THAT SAID, SHE'S EXCITED
TO SPEAK WITH ANYONE OUT
THERE WHO WISHES TO SAY HELLO.

114
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,389
IT'S A ONCE‐IN‐A‐LIFETIME
OPPORTUNITY,

115
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,725
SO I'D ADVISE YOU
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.

116
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,561
[MAN] OH, SERIOUSLY?
OH, MY GOD!

117
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:38,131
OK, THEN FINE. WE'LL BE
THE FIRST ONES UP.

118
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,501
(CHEERING)

119
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,903
[MAN 1] KRUSTY WAS SO COOL
BACK THERE. WHAT A STUNT.

120
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:45,338
[MAN 2] BUT THAT SHIROE
GUY WAS SO CREEPY...

121
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,073
AND HE WAS EVEN MEAN
TO THE PRINCESS.

122
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,975
[MAN 3] WHO DOES THAT GUY
THINK HE IS ANYWAY?

123
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,513
[MAN 4] I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S EVEN DOING THIS.

124
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,420
LOOKS LIKE THE ENEMY'S
ATTEMPTS TO CONFUSE US
HAVE FINALLY STOPPED.

125
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:01,855
DOES THAT MEAN...

126
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,490
DOES THAT MEAN MARVESS
WAS THE MASTERMIND BEHIND IT?

127
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,627
[SHIROE] I DON'T KNOW.
JUDGING BY HIS ACTIONS,

128
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:09,896
HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE
MASTERMIND TYPE, NOW, DID HE?

129

[SHIROE] YOU DID VERY
WELL TODAY. THANK YOU.

132
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,673
[MINORI] UH, SURE!

133
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,943
SO, SHIROE...

134
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:23,877
[SHIROE] HMM?

135
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,612
I KNOW THAT A LOT'S
BEEN GOING ON,

136
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,014
BUT AREN'T YOU GOING TO
SAY HELLO TO THE PRINCESS?

137
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,315
HUH?

138
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,817
[MINORI] I MEAN, ALL THE
OTHER GUILD LEADERS

139
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,186
FROM THE ROUND TABLE
ARE ALREADY THERE, SO...

140
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,090
[SHIROE] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I JUST SAW HER, DIDN'T I?

141
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,561
BESIDES, I'VE ALREADY DONE MY
JOB, SO I DON'T SEE MUCH NEED.

142
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,295
[MINORI]
YOU DID YOUR JOB?

143
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,429
[KRUSTY] AH...
[MARIELLE] OH, MY GOODNESS!

144
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,298
YOU ARE, LIKE,
JUST WAY TOO CUTE!

145
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,767
OH, I JUST COULD
BARELY STAND IT!

146
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,234
LET ME JUST RUB‐
(RAYNESHIA LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

147
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,770
[SHIROE] I'M NOT SURE
WHAT'S GOING ON,

148
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,806
BUT I'M SURE MARIELLE HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

149
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,843
[MINORI] ARE YOU DOING
THIS ON PURPOSE?

150
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,645
[SHIROE] HUH?
[MINORI] COME ON!

151
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:02,248
DID YOU TRY TO MAKE PRINCESS
RAYNESHIA NOT LIKE YOU OR WHAT?!

152
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:06,252
UH... YEAH. MAYBE.

153
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,621
[MINORI] HUH?

154
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:09,255
[SHIROE] IT'S JUST A LITTLE
"GOOD COP, BAD COP."

155
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,325
SOMETIMES YOU NEED A SITUATION
LIKE THAT TO MAKE THINGS WORK.

156
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:16,262
IN THE PRINCESS' CASE, OF COURSE
KRUSTY IS THE GOOD COP.

157
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,803
[MINORI, THINKING] SO HE REALLY
IS DOING IT ALL DELIBERATELY.

158
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,239
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
HAVE SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE
PLAN TO CARRY OUT.

159
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,542
IT'S FOR THE BEST.
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)

160
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:30,076
[MINORI] AND YOU'RE
OK WITH THAT?

161
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,046
HUH? OH, YOU'RE WORRIED
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE

162
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,049
ALL OF LOG HORIZON
INSTEAD OF JUST ME.

163
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,684
[SHIROE] I CAN TALK
TO THE CHIEF TO SEE IF‐

164
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,085
NO, THAT'S NOT IT!

165
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,823
I MEAN, DOESN'T IT HURT
TO HAVE PEOPLE HATE YOU?!

166
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,858
[SHIROE] HUH?

167
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,159
(SNIFFLING)

168
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,962
[SHIROE] I GUESS I'VE
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

169
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:53,366
BUT I CAN SEE I GUESS
IT MIGHT LOOK THAT WAY.

170
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,768
HM.

171
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:59,339
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU REALLY
HELPED ME OUT THIS TIME.

172
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,877
[SHIROE] HONESTLY, YOU DID
MORE THAN 10 OTHER PEOPLE
COULD'VE DONE IN YOUR PLACE.

173
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:05,779
I MEAN THAT.

174
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,314
IT'S KIND OF THE
SAME THING.

175
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,616
WHEN SOMEONE NEEDS
SOMETHING DONE,

176
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,317
AND YOU HAVE THE
ABILITY TO DO IT,

177
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,888
PEOPLE NEED SOMETHING FROM YOU,
AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

178
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,823
HUH?

179
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,594
I WAS AFRAID OF EVEN MAKING
A GUILD IN THE FIRST PLACE,

180
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,996
[SHIROE] BUT I REALIZED...

181
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,567
I REALIZED THAT BEING STRONG
ON YOUR OWN IS MEANINGLESS.

182
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,135
TO USE YOUR POWER,
YOU NEED OTHER PEOPLE.

183
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,273
AND YOU NEED A WORLD WHERE
EVERYONE AROUND YOU IS
ABLE TO BE AT THEIR BEST.

184
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,808
OH...

185
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,511
AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING I
CAN DO TO HELP THAT WORLD GROW,

186
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:39,179
I'LL WORK AT LEAST
AS HARD AS YOU.

187
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,547
I'LL DO ALL I CAN.

188
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,783
MINORI, I DON'T WANT TO
CAUSE YOU ANY PROBLEMS.

189
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,018
I'LL DO MY BEST
TO AVOID THEM.

190
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,922
UH... UM, THANK YOU.

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,199
[MINORI] COME ON! DID YOU TRY
TO MAKE PRINCESS RAYNESHIA
NOT LIKE YOU OR WHAT?!

192
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,335
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I DIDN'T KNOW.

193
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,807
[MINORI] I MEAN, DOESN'T IT
HURT TO HAVE PEOPLE HATE YOU?!

194
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,209
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I DIDN'T REALIZE.

195
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,413
[SHIROE] HONESTLY, YOU DID
MORE THAN 10 OTHER PEOPLE
COULD'VE DONE IN YOUR PLACE.

196
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,481
I MEAN THAT.

197
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:19,853
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM THE
WHOLE TIME, AND I...

198
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,789
(SIGHS)

199
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,158
(SPLASH)

200
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,141
[SHIROE] OSHIMA?
WHERE ARE YOU?

201
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,477
[WOMAN] I'M SORRY.
OSHIMA WILL NOT BE HERE TONIGHT.

202
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,912
[SHIROE] UH...

203
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,082
[WOMAN] YOU ARE SHIROE, CORRECT?
MY NAME IS DARIELLA.

204
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,352
I'M A TRAVELING AUTHOR AND ONE
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

205
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:57,123
OSHIMA IS CURRENTLY TIED UP
WITH SOMETHING AT THE MOMENT
AND SADLY UNABLE TO ATTEND.

206
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:02,028
INSTEAD, I WILL BE HAPPY TO TELL
YOU ABOUT MINAMI IN HIS PLACE.

207
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,765
[SHIROE] I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
THE SPELL YOU'RE USING,

208
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,601
BUT IT CREATES AN
INTERESTING DISGUISE...

209
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:09,235
[SHIROE] NUREHA.

210
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,905
(NUREHA CHUCKLES)

211
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,611
(CHUCKLES)
VERY WELL DONE.

212
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,947
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY, SHIROE, HUH?

213
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,987
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
AWARE OF MY OVERLAY YET.

214
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,356
[NUREHA] IT'S A RATHER COMPLEX
INFORMATION‐CONTROL SPELL.

215
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,058
[SHIROE] INTUITION.

216
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,527
[NUREHA] OH, YEAH?

217
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:34,828
(GIGGLES)

218
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,263
WELL, THEN I WON'T
INQUIRE FURTHER, MY DEAR.

219
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:41,267
ALTHOUGH, I AM PLEASED THAT YOU
ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHO I AM.

220
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,304
[SHIROE] I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
YOU'RE THE RULER OF THE WEST.

221
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,173
OH, COME, NOW.
I WOULDN'T SAY I'M A RULER.

222
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,210
[SHIROE] NO MATTER WHAT
YOU CALL YOURSELF,
YOU ARE THE LEADER,

223
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,913
EVEN IF YOU'VE LEFT THE
COMMAND OF EVERYTHING BACK HOME

224
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,717
IN THE HANDS OF INTICS,
MIZUHA, AND ZELDYS.

225
00:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,220
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
THE GUILD THAT OVERSEAS
THE WESTERN CITY OF MINAMI

226
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,556
IS CALLED PLANT HWYADEN.

227
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:07,528
AND ITS GUILD MASTER
WHO CONTROLS EVERYTHING
TO THE WEST IS NUREHA.

228
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,095
(NUREHA CHUCKLES)

229
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,264
[SHIROE] SOON AFTER
THE APOCALYPSE,
YOU FOUND YOUR PLACE.

230
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,900
YOU WON THE FAVOR OF
NOBILITY IN MINAMI,

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,069
AND YOU MADE ITS
GUARDS YOUR SERVANTS.

232
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,772
YOU EVEN CONTROLLED
THE NOBILITY'S WEALTH,

233
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,974
AND THEN YOU BOUGHT
THE CATHEDRAL...

234
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:26,112
WHERE ALL THE ADVENTURERS WHO
DIE ULTIMATELY GO TO REVIVE.

235
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,314
[SHIROE] YOU GAINED ENORMOUS
POLITICAL AUTHORITY

236
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,318
AS WELL AS INFLUENCE OVER THE
VERY LIVES OF THE ADVENTURERS.

237
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,022
AND THEN YOU FINALLY DECLARED
THAT EVERY ADVENTURER IN MINAMI

238
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,693
WOULD BE FORCED TO
JOIN PLANT HWYADEN.

239
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,428
I'VE BEEN TOLD THERE'S
JUST ONE GUILD IN TOWN,

240
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,830
SO THERE'S NO COMPETITION.

241
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,298
IS THAT RIGHT?

242
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,934
(NUREHA CHUCKLES)
[NUREHA] ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

243
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:51,204
NUREHA, WHAT BRINGS YOU
HERE TO AKIHABARA?

244
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,807
[NUREHA] I HAVE COME
TO INVITE YOU TO JOIN US,

245
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,442
TO JOIN PLANT HWYADEN.

246
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:58,111
TO BE BY MY SIDE.

247
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,681
[NUREHA] TO WALK WITH ME.

248
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,849
AND TO PROTECT ME.

249
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,084
[SHIROE] WHY?

250
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,653
[NUREHA] OH, DON'T
PLAY THE FOOL.

251
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:08,755
YOU MUST KNOW
I WANT YOU.

252
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:13,560
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR
MOVEMENTS AND PROGRESS FOR
A LONG, LONG TIME, SHIROE.

253
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,861
(SHIROE CRINGES)

254
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,163
[NUREHA] IT'S TRUE,
AND I KNOW EVERYTHING...

255
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,433
INCLUDING YOUR CREATION OF
A NEW MAGIC AT ZANTLEAF.

256
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,936
[SHIROE] AND I KNOW QUITE
A BIT ABOUT YOU, AS WELL.

257
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,405
YOU RESTARTED THE TRANSPORT
GATES BETWEEN CITIES,

258
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:28,074
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
STILL HIGHLY UNSTABLE.

259
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:32,178
[NUREHA] WELL, JUST BECAUSE
YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

260
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,982
WAS IT YOUR ORDER TO CUT OFF
ALL INFORMATION FROM THE WEST?

261
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,484
[NUREHA] THAT WAS SOMETHING
MIZUHA DECIDED TO DO.

262
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:42,155
[SHIROE] PERHAPS.
AND WHAT OF DISTURBANCES
AIMED AT THE ROUND TABLE?

263
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,158
ONE OF MARVESS' LITTLE IDEAS
GOT A BIT OUT OF HAND...

264
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,928
(CHUCKLES)
THOUGH YOU DEALT
WITH IT SPLENDIDLY.

265
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,429
VERY WELL DONE.

266
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,599
(SHIROE SNARLS)
YOU KNEW ABOUT IT,
AND YOU DID NOTHING!

267
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,101
OH!

268
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,572
[NUREHA] WHY DON'T YOU BE QUIET
AND COME WITH ME, SHIROE?

269
00:13:58,672 --> 00:13:59,906
[SHIROE] UHH...

270
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,075
[NUREHA] OH, WHY NOT?

271
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,145
BECAUSE NONE OF WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE.

272
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,148
OK. IF I TELL THE TRUTH,
WILL YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

273
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,617
I CAN'T SAY THAT
UNTIL YOU TELL ME.

274
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:15,421
[NUREHA] OF COURSE, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

275
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,459
THOUGH I ASSURE YOU, THE TRUTH
IS NOTHING YOU WANT TO HEAR.

276
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,429
BUT THEN AGAIN, YOU ARE
A SPECIAL BREED, AREN'T YOU?

277
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,331
[SHIROE] HMM.

278
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,669
I WAS SO PLAIN...
REALLY JUST A SIMPLE WOMAN.

279
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,003
[SHIROE] UH...

280
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,572
[NUREHA] I NEVER STOOD
OUT IN THE CROWD.

281
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:35,075
IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE
NOTHING MORE THAN THE AIR.

282
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:38,044
NO ONE KNEW ME NOR
REMEMBERED MY NAME.

283
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,447
NO ONE EVER EVEN NOTICED
IF I WAS THERE OR NOT.

284
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,984
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

285
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,787
THEN I DISCOVERED
"ELDER TALES."

286
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,723
I THOUGHT THAT HERE
IT WOULD CHANGE.

287
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,792
SOMEONE MIGHT SEE ME.

288
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,228
IN HERE, SOMEONE
MIGHT NEED ME.

289
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,199
BUT NO. IT WAS NO DIFFERENT
HERE THAN IN REALITY.

290
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:03,670
NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, THE AIR
IS STILL NOTHING BUT AIR.

291
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,339
HOWEVER...

292
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,677
THERE WAS ONE PERSON OUT THERE
WHO SEEMED TO NOTICE ME.

293
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:15,015
HE KNEW WHO I WAS. HE TOLD
ME THINGS, LIKE THAT
I WAS TALENTED.

294
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:20,587
HE TOLD ME HE RESPECTED
WHO I WAS AND HOW I MANAGED
TO PLAY SO WELL ON MY OWN.

295
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:26,259
AND WE HAD SOMETHING IN COMMON,
HE WAS AN ENCHANTER LIKE ME.
(SHIROE GASPS)

296
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,363
OK. SO WHO IS THIS
ENCHANTER? TELL ME.

297
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,098
(NUREHA GIGGLES)

298
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,901
I'M SORRY. I MADE
THAT PART UP.

299
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,369
[SHIROE] BUT WAIT... WHY?

300
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,305
[NUREHA] OH, SHIROE,
IS IT NOT TRUE

301
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,442
THAT YOU'RE ON THE
VERGE OF FINDING IT?

302
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:46,346
FINDING FRACTION,
FINDING THE WAY HOME?

303
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,748
[SHIROE] UH...

304
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,015
(NUREHA LAUGHS)

305
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,619
YES, YOU REALLY ARE
A SPECIAL ONE, SHIROE!

306
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:57,223
[NUREHA] A MEANS OF GOING
BACK TO OUR OWN WORLD HAS
INDEED BEEN DISCOVERED.

307
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,160
I CAN'T PROVE THAT
IT'S A WAY BACK YET,

308
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,496
[SHIROE] ONLY THAT IT CAN
MAKE SOMEONE DISAPPEAR.

309
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:06,266
[NUREHA] DON'T YOU THINK THAT
IF YOU WORKED WITH ME,

310
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,935
THAT THE TWO OF US COULD
PROVE IT TOGETHER?

311
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,203
[SHIROE] HMM.

312
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,238
IF YOU CAME BACK WITH
ME TO PLANT HWYADEN,

313
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,843
THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ACCESS
TO FAR MORE INFORMATION THAN
YOU'D EVER FIND IN AKIHABARA.

314
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,246
AND YOU COULD USE ALL THE PEOPLE
OF THE LAND'S MONEY AND POWER

315
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,949
IN ANY WAY YOU SEE FIT.

316
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,520
[NUREHA] I THINK IT'S THE
MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR
YOU TO FIND A WAY HOME,

317
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,522
AS WELL AS THE BEST
CHANCE FOR YOU TO HELP

318
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:31,658
ALL THE WORLD'S POOR
LOST ADVENTURERS.

319
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:34,027
(SHIROE GRIMACES)

320
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,362
(CHUCKLES)
BESIDES...

321
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,500
[NUREHA] YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE
ANY REAL REASON AT ALL, DO YOU?

322
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,503
[SHIROE] A REASON?
[NUREHA] THAT'S RIGHT.

YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO HELP AKIHABARA,

NOR ANY REASON TO HELP
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

325
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,378
ALL YOU HAVE IS A WHISPERING,
VAGUE SENSE OF ETHICS.

326
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,816
HONESTLY, IT MUST BE
PAINFUL FOR YOU.

BUT THINK ABOUT
IT, SHIROE.

329
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,722
WHY DON'T YOU ALLOW LITTLE
OLD ME TO BE YOUR REASON?

330
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:06,092

EXCUSE TO DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT IN THIS WORLD...

ME TO DO FOR YOU.

334
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:17,137
AND WHATEVER YOU WANT
ME TO DO FOR YOU.

335
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:20,574
[NUREHA] I WILL GIVE IT
TO YOU, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

336
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,209
BUT WHY?

337
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,779
AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
BECAUSE I WANT YOU.

338
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:30,116

TO ACHIEVE ALL YOUR DESIRES.

339
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:34,120
[NUREHA] MAKE ME
YOUR EXCUSE.

340

[NUREHA] AH!

342
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,096
[NUREHA] SHIROE?

343
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:45,098
IT LOOKS LIKE MY
REASON IS VERY CLEAR,

344
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,668
AND I WON'T LET MYSELF
MAKE IT AN EXCUSE.

345
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:51,738
[SHIROE] IF I WERE TO
DO THAT, EVERYTHING
WILL TURN INTO A LIE...

[SHIROE] EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE
WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD.

347

MAKE ANYONE INTO AN EXCUSE.

OF YOU FROM BEFORE.

AND EVEN IF I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU HAD TALENT,

354
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:18,131
I CAN'T USE YOU...
AS SOME EXCUSE...

355

[SHIROE] AND I
CANNOT GO WITH YOU.

356
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:23,136
BUT PLEASE, SHIROE!

357
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:28,575
[SHIROE] I CAN GIVE YOU WHAT
YOU WANT MORE EFFECTIVELY AS
A FOE THAN I CAN AS A FRIEND.
