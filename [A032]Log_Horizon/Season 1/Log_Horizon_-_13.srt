[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER]
IN OUR NEW WORLD,

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:07,107
IN ADDITION TO ADVENTURERS
AND PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,943
THERE ARE ALSO GROUPS
CALLED DEMI‐HUMANS.

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,545
FOR EXAMPLE, THE GOBLINS.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:15,481
THEY HAVE LIMITED INTELLIGENCE
BUT ARE HARDY AND BREED QUICKLY.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,684
AND ABOVE ALL,
THEY'RE CRUEL AND WICKED.

7
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,620
(GOBLIN HISSES)

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,525
AN INDIVIDUAL GOBLIN IS NO MATCH
FOR AN ADVENTURER OF EVEN
INTERMEDIATE STRENGTH.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,829
HOWEVER, THEIR NUMBERS
AND VARIETY SHOULD NOT
BE UNDERESTIMATED.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,667
YOU CAN FIND MOST GOBLINS
IN THE NORTHEAST PART
OF THE ISLAND CHAIN.

11
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,266
[SHIROE] OBVIOUSLY,
SOME OF THESE CONFLICT.

12
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,301
AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
REALLY BAD FORM ON OUR PART

13
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,604
IF WE SHOW UP AT
ONLY ONE OF THESE.

14
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,706
[KRUSTY] THERE'S THE
BANQUET WITH LORD DALTE,

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,709
THE EVENING PARTY WITH MOSTLY
YOUNG KNIGHTS ATTENDING,

16
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,679
AND A DINNER MEETING WITH
COUNT KIRINO OF TSUKUBA

17
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,581
AND THE ACADEMICS GUILD.

18
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,984
YEAH, I'D BE OUT OF MY LEAGUE
WITH THAT ACADEMICS GUILD.

19
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,318
[KRUSTY] SAME HERE.

20
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,721
ACADEMICS. MY KIND OF PEOPLE.

21
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,659
AND SO, WHY DON'T YOU
GO SEE THE KNIGHTS, KRUSTY?

22
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,395
I'M SURE THE DANCE
WILL AGREE WITH YOU.

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,567
[KRUSTY] THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA, ACTUALLY.

24
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,770
RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE I'LL TAKE
THE BANQUET WITH LORD DALTE.

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,606
(AKATSUKI GROWLING)
[HENRIETTA] YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK, KRUSTY?

26
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:55,141
YOU DO REALIZE THAT YOU'LL BE
SPENDING MOST OF YOUR TIME

27
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,078
FLATTERING LORDS
AND NOBLE LADIES?

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,315
[KRUSTY] LATELY, I FOUND A
SHIELD FOR ALL MY SHORTCOMINGS
THAT'S SO EFFECTIVE,

29
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,084
IT'S NEARLY UNBREAKABLE.

30
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,554
I'LL BE BETTER
THAN OK, THANK YOU.

31
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,756
[ALL] A SHIELD?

32
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,898
(YAWNING)

33
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:19,499
(DOOR OPENS)

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,136
[ELISSA] IT'S ALMOST BEDTIME,
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,337
(RAYNESHIA SIGHS)

36
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,507
UH, NO, ELISSA.

37
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,409
I'M NOT WEARING
THOSE SILK PAJAMAS.

38
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,311
THOSE PAJAMAS ARE EVIL.

39
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,514
ARE YOU REALLY GOING
TO DO THIS AGAIN?

40
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,181
[ELISSA] YOUR FLANNELS, MILADY.

41
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,783
(RAYNESHIA SQUEALS)

42
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,020
THESE ARE PERFECT, AND I KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA BRING THEM!

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,555
THANK YOU!

44
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,524
[ELISSA] YOU NEED TO WEAR THE
SILK EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

45
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,325
I'M THE ONE WHO'S
GETTING YELLED AT.

46
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,227
[RAYNESHIA] SURE,
EVENTUALLY.

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,529
(ELISSA SIGHS)

48
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,430
YOU DO KNOW THAT ALL THE
GENTLEMEN IN MAIHAMA

49
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,800
REFER TO YOU AS THE MELANCHOLY
TWILIGHT PRINCESS?

50
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,270
WELL, A REAL GENTLEMAN WOULDN'T
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

51
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,706
AND I AM, BY MY OWN
ADMISSION, UNMOTIVATED.

52
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,275
[ELISSA] WELL, I DOUBT ANY OF
THEM WOULD APPRECIATE YOU

SLEEPWEAR ALL DAY.

54
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,082
YEAH. WHATEVER.

55
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,419
[KRUSTY] I'M SORRY, LORD KILIVA,
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE OTHER
PLANS FOR TONIGHT.

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,022
[KILIVA] HUH? DO YOU
HAVE ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT?

57
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,058
OH. PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

58
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,526
UH...

59
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,665
IT IS A PLEASURE TO
MEET YOU, MILADY.

YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

62
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,706
[RAYNESHIA] OK. SO WHAT DID
YOU MEAN BY "YOUR PLANS"?

63
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:34,808
[KRUSTY] THAT WAS TO
GET RID OF MY SHADOW.

64
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,211
I'M SORRY IF IT CAUSED YOU
ANY DISTRESS, OF COURSE.

65
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,080
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,585
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
HE'S NOT A BAD GUY, PER SE,
BUT HE IS ANNOYING.

67
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,420
YOU WERE JUST THINKING ABOUT
HOW ANNOYING I AM, RIGHT?

68
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,890
[RAYNESHIA] UH! UH...

69
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,593
[KRUSTY] AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN
OUR EYES FIRST MET, YOU THOUGHT,

70
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,427
"HE'S GONNA BOTHER ME,
ISN'T HE?"

71
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,197

H‐H‐HOW DID YOU...?

72

A LITTLE GIFT I HAVE.

HE CAN READ MY MIND.

75
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,741

78
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,716
[KRUSTY] I REALIZE THE
PROSPECT DOESN'T PLEASE YOU,
BUT RIGHT NOW,

79
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,952
ME AND MY FRIENDS ARE REALLY
UNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS.

80
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,386
OH.

81
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,855
[KRUSTY] IF THE TWO OF US
WERE TO TAKE TEA TOGETHER,

82
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,490
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY PROVIDE
BOTH OF US AN EXCUSE

83
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:27,761
TO SKIP SOME OF THE EVENTS
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PLANNED.

[ELISSA] PLEASE BE CAREFUL
AROUND HIM, PRINCESS.

87

OH, YES, HE'S A BAD MAN WHO CAN
TELL EXACTLY WHAT I'M THINKING.

NAUGHTY BOY.

89
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,042
[ELISSA] THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,810
HUH?

91
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,480

AND REALLY WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

[RAYNESHIA] HMM... YEAH.

93
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,518
[ELISSA] YOU KNOW I DON'T
WANT TO REMIND YOU OF THIS,

94
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,654
SINCE IT'S SUCH
A BOTHER FOR YOU,

95
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:57,891
BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
YOUR POSITION AS A MEMBER OF
THE DUKE'S FAMILY, AFTER ALL.

96
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,459
RIGHT...

97
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,831
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
A DUCAL FAMILY MEMBER?

98
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,633

00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,113
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
TAKE IT EASY, GENTLEMEN.

ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO DRESS YOURSELF.

00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,199

00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,573

00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,309
[KNIGHT] YAA! YA!

114
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,177
YAA!

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,548
OHH.

117
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,216
[KNIGHT] TH‐THE MATCH IS YOURS.

118
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,985
I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE BEEN
HIT THAT HARD BEFORE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

119
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,354
I'D BE HONORED TO BE YOUR
APPRENTICE, IF YOU'D HAVE ME.

120
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,489
(NERVOUS LAUGH)

121
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,026
[RAYNESHIA] A GOODWILL MATCH?

122
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,428
[KRUSTY] YES. THEY INVITED ME.

123
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,263
THAT'S KIND OF
SURPRISING.

124
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,965
WHAT IS, MILADY?

125
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,568
WOULDN'T AN ADVENTURER
LIKE YOU FIND SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TEDIOUS?

126
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,302
[KRUSTY] NOT AT ALL.
[RAYNESHIA] UH...

127
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,872
[KRUSTY] I'D REALLY LIKE
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND,

128
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,474
AND THIS IS A
GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

(CHEERING)

130
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,712
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
THAT'S A LIE.

131
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,049
HE'S LOOKING TO SEE HOW
SKILLED OUR FIGHTERS ARE.

132
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,551
HUH?

133
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,952
[SHIROE] KRUSTY?

134
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,688
[SCHOLAR] OOH, THAT'S
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

135
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,723
(KNIGHT LAUGHS)
[RAYNESHIA] SO, AS AN
ADVENTURER,

136
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,759
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
YOUR SPARRING MATCHES?

137
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,427
IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM
COULD BE STRONGER THAN YOU.

138
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:44,565
[KRUSTY] NO, THEY WERE
ALL VERY TALENTED.

139
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,233
THAT LAST FIGHT
WAS RATHER CLOSE.

140
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,135
I SEE.

141
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:54,340
[KRUSTY] SO IT WOULDN'T BE
EASY TO FIGHT YOUR WAY UP
AND EARN FIRST RANK HERE.

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,276
HMM.

143
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:57,544
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

144
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,679
[KNIGHTS] HUH?

145
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,113
[RAYNESHIA] HUH? UH, YES?

146
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,315
[KRUSTY] IF IT PLEASES YOU,
WOULD YOU OFFER A REWARD

147
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:07,153
TO THE STRONGEST OF THESE
BRAVE KNIGHTS WHO ARE FIGHTING
FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT TODAY?

148
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,555
[RAYNESHIA] A REWARD?

149
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,591
A SIMPLE REWARD...

150
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:14,294
THE RIGHT TO ACCOMPANY
YOU TO TONIGHT'S PARTY.

151
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:16,697

(CHEERING CONTINUES)

154
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:30,343
WELL, I'LL BE. THAT'S A
PRETTY GOOD SHIELD, KRUSTY.

155
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,979
[LORD 1] SO WHAT DOES THE
DUKE INTEND TO DO WITH
THE ADVENTURERS

156
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,715
NOW THAT THEY'RE HERE?

157
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,051
[LORD 2] HE'S GOT THEM
AT THE TABLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN TALK TO THEM.

158
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:41,321
[LORD 1] BY THE WAY,
HAVE ANY OF YOUR PEOPLE HEARD
WHERE THE IZUMO KNIGHTS ARE?

159
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,157
[LORD 2] WE CAN JUST HIRE
ADVENTURERS TO FIND THAT OUT.

160
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,626
HMM.

161
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,460
[LORD 2] IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU CAN KILL ANY OF THEM.

162
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,962
OHH.

163
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:52,232
GOOD AFTERNOON, GENTLEMEN.
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

164
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,668

00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,075
[KRUSTY] OH...HUH.

329
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,211
[GIRL 1] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

330
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,946
I'M SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

331
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,415
IT MUST SEEM AWFULLY
FORWARD OF US.

332
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,218
[GIRL 2] MAY WE JOIN YOU?
WE'D LOVE TO CHAT.

333
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,722
[GIRL 1] WE BROUGHT COOKIES!

334
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:05,659
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
THESE GIRLS ARE NICE ENOUGH
AND ALL, BUT... UGH.

335
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,327
WE SAW YOU
FIGHT OUT THERE.

336
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,930
WHAT YOU DID WITH YOUR
SWORD WAS REALLY AMAZING.

337
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,632
YOU'RE REALLY STRONG,
AREN'T YOU?

338
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:14,000
[KRUSTY] NO. I STILL
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

339
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,468
OH, DON'T
BE SO MODEST.

340
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,538
YOU WERE SO GOOD,
YOU TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

341
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:21,542
[KRUSTY] I'M UNWORTHY OF PRAISE
FROM LADIES AS LOVELY AS YOU.

342
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,176
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

343
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,811
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] GREAT.

344
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:28,949
WHY IS HE SO POLITE AND FUN WITH
THEM AND A COMPLETE SNOT TO ME?

345
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,684
KRUSTY, YOU'RE
JUST SO AWESOME!

346
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:34,755
OF ALL THE ADVENTURERS,
YOU'RE THE MOST COOL,
NOBLE, AND HANDSOME!

347
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:39,225
YEAH. EVERYBODY'S
BEEN TALKING
ABOUT YOU, KRUSTY.

348
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,862
EMBARRASSED AND FLATTERED
AT THE SAME TIME.

349
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:43,329
[GIRL 1] NO, NO.

350
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,232
IT'S SO OBVIOUS THAT YOUR
HANDSOME, DIGNIFIED ELEGANCE

351
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,369
IS WHY THE PRINCESS HAS LETTING
YOU BE AROUND HER TONIGHT.

352
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,471
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
PRINCESS RAYNESHIA?

353
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,374
[RAYNESHIA] UH, YES, ABSOLUTELY!

354
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,243
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
AND WHAT DID I JUST AGREE TO?

355
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,546
[GIRL 1] PRINCESS RAYNESHIA
IS SO BEAUTIFUL,

356
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,315
IT'S A PRIVILEGE
JUST BEING WITH HER.

357
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,751
[KRUSTY] SHE'S VERY KIND
AND COMPASSIONATE.

358
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:09,790
SHE'D HAVE TO BE TO LET A
BARBARIAN LIKE ME STAY IN
HER COMPANY FOR VERY LONG.

359
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,625
UHH... UHH...

360
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:14,294
[KRUSTY] ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH
THE MANNERS OF THE COURT.

361
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:20,066
HER KIND SOLICITATIONS ALLOW ME
TO AVOID BEING LOOKED UPON
AS A COMPLETE PHILISTINE.

362
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,369
IT IS AN HONOR OF
WHICH I AM UNWORTHY.

363
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,972
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] AH...

364
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,810
OH, MR. BAD PERSON,
YOU ARE BAD...
THE WORST BAD PERSON EVER!

365
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:33,780
OH, COME ON! WE'VE
GOT TO INTRODUCE YOU
AROUND TO EVERYBODY!

366
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,482
AND ONCE EVERYONE IN THE
COURT GETS TO KNOW YOU,

367
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,553
I'M SURE THEY WON'T THINK YOU'RE
A PHILA‐WHATCHAMACALLIT.

368
00:18:39,653 --> 00:18:43,557
[KRUSTY] NO. I'M A BARBARIAN
WHO KNOWS ONLY WAR.

369
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:47,961
AND UNTIL I CAN REPAY
THE PRINCESS FOR THE
KINDNESS SHE'S SHOWN ME,

370
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,531
I SIMPLY CANNOT LEAVE HER SIDE.

371
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,398
[GIRLS] OHH!

372
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,201
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOUR EVIL KNOWS
NO BOUNDS, DOES IT?

373
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,704
[GIRL 1] OH, A KNIGHT
SERVING HIS LADY!

374
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,173
[GIRL 2] IT'S SO SWEET!

375
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:03,409
[RAYNESHIA] LEAVE IF YOU WANT.

376
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,512
IF THE PRETTY PALACE FLOWERS
HAVE YOUR ATTENTION,

377
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,048
DON'T LET ME STOP YOU
FROM TAKING OFF.

378
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,750
TA.

379
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,285
[KRUSTY] I'M AFRAID I
ALREADY HAVE MY HANDS
FULL WITH ONE FLOWER.

380
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,887
STUFFING HER FACE.

381
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:18,491
OH, RIGHT. I GUESS I DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU ABOUT GIRLS, DO I?

382
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,360
[KRUSTY] DEPENDS
ON THE GIRL.

383
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,495
[RAYNESHIA] OH... HUH?

384
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,898
[KRUSTY] I HAVE A LITTLE SISTER
BACK WHERE I COME FROM.

385
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,934
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF PRINCESS
IN HER, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

386
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:33,106
[RAYNESHIA] UH, SO YOU'RE
SAYING THAT I'M KIND OF
LIKE YOUR SISTER?

387
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,608
YEAH.

388
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,344
YOU CAN'T SEE HER RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET HOME?

389
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,414
BOTH WOULD DEFINITELY BE
A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

390
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,417
YOU REALLY MISS HER,
THEN, DON'T YOU?

391
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,387
[KRUSTY] I COULDN'T SAY.

392
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:51,291
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOU'RE LYING AGAIN.

393
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,494
[KRUSTY] YOU REMIND ME
OF HER QUITE A BIT...

394
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,631
YOU CATCHING A NAP ON A TABLE,
EVEN THOUGH IT ISN'T LADY‐LIKE.

395
00:19:57,731 --> 00:19:59,165
UHH...

396
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,135
[KRUSTY] SHE'D LAY AROUND
THE HOUSE ALL DAY IF YOU
DIDN'T GET HER UP,

397
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,904
AND FORGET ANY OF
THOSE FANCY TALKS.

398
00:20:04,004 --> 00:20:06,272
[RAYNESHIA] HEY, YOU DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME!

399
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,908
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SAY THAT?

400
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,310
[KRUSTY] BECAUSE YOU'RE
EXACTLY LIKE SHE IS.
[RAYNESHIA] UHH...

401
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,078
[KRUSTY] IT'S AMAZING, REALLY.

402
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:16,216
BEING AROUND YOU HAS
SOMEHOW MADE THIS WHOLE
AFFAIR A LOT EASIER ON ME.

403
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:17,718
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

404
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:21,154
GIVE ME A CHANCE TO PAY YOU
BACK DURING THE CONFERENCE?

405
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:24,057
ONE HAND WASHES THE OTHER, HUH?

406
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:27,460
[KRUSTY] TIT FOR TAT.

407
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:30,664
[RAYNESHIA]
ALL RIGHT. IT'S A DEAL.

408
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,180
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
KISS MY HAND, DUMMY!

409
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,249
HMM.

410
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:02,328
(WALTZ MUSIC PLAYING)

411
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:08,168
UH...

412
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:12,573
[AKATSUKI]
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...

413
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,275
AKATSUKI. YOU'RE AWAKE?

414
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,442
(AKATSUKI GASPS)

415
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:19,179
MY LORD... HOW LONG
WERE YOU THERE?!

416
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,082
NOT LONG. YOU THIRSTY?

417
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,417
(AKATSUKI CRINGES)

418
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:26,687
[SHIROE] HERE YOU GO.

419
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:29,623
THE GUYS FROM THE ACADEMIC
GUILD FINALLY LET ME GO.

420
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:33,359
THEY KEPT PESTERING
ME TO LET THEM DO
RESEARCH ON ADVENTURERS.

421
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,061
[AKATSUKI] OK...

422
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,663
HMM.

423
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,266
AKATSUKI, THINKING:
HIS HAIR SWIRLS TO
THE RIGHT. IT'S CUTE.

424
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,035
[SHIROE] SO, DID YOU
LEARN ANYTHING NEW?

425
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,005
[AKATSUKI] WELL...
THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND SEE
US AS POTENTIAL ENEMIES,

426
00:21:45,105 --> 00:21:47,508
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE
PLANNING ANYTHING TO HURT US.

427
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,510
THEY JUST HAVE THEIR WORRIES.

428
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,111
[SHIROE] I GUESS
THAT'S GOOD.

429
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,915
I THINK WHAT FRIGHTENS THEM
THE MOST IS OUR POWER, MY LORD.

430
00:21:55,015 --> 00:21:59,786
NEITHER OF US HAS A REAL
GOOD IDEA AS TO WHAT THE
OTHER IS TRULY CAPABLE OF.

431
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:04,558
SO THEY EITHER REALLY LIKE US
OR THEY'RE GONNA KILL US ALL.

432
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:07,160
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?

433
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,729
LET ME THINK...

434
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,465
I OVERHEARD SOMETHING ABOUT
THE IZUMO KNIGHTS BEING MISSING.

435
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:14,267
[SHIROE] "IZUMO KNIGHTS"?

436
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:16,002
(GASPS)

437
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,539
(RUMBLING)

438
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,444
(RUMBLING STOPS)

439
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,781
[MAN] HELLO. YOU MUST BE
SHIROE OF LOG HORIZON.

440
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,383
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY RATHER
DRAMATIC ENTRANCE,

441
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,319
BUT I HAVE COME TO SPEAK
WITH YOU THIS EVENING.

442
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,255
AND YOU ARE...?

443
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,290
I'M THE MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE.

444
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,425
REGAN IS MY NAME.

445
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,895
WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS.

446
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,791
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THAT DAY, EVERYTHING CHANGED.

447
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,126
THAT DAY, I SUDDENLY
FOUND MYSELF HERE.

448
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:24,297
THAT DAY, THE APOCALYPSE
DESCENDED ON TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

449
00:24:24,397 --> 00:24:28,802
THE MAGE OF ETERNAL EYES, REGAN,
SPEAKS REGARDING ITS SECRETS.

450
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:32,506
SHIROE LEARNS THE RULES THAT
GOVERN THE LIVES OF ADVENTURERS.

451
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,175
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
