1
00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:04,905
[REGAN] NOW, THAT'S STRANGE...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,441
[AKATSUKI] THIS IS EVEN
MORE AMAZING THAN
YOUR STUDY, MY LORD.

3
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,576
SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

4
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,845
I COULD HAVE SWORN I
HAD A COUPLE OF VIALS

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,947
FOR US TO DRINK FROM
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

6
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,516
[SHIROE] IT'S ALL RIGHT.

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,251
[REGAN] HUH? HMM.

8
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,622
[SHIROE] TRY THIS.

9
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,692
(REGAN SLURPS) HMM.

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:31,031
BY THE WAY, ISN'T THAT
DAZANEGG'S MAGIC BAG?

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,033
I BELIEVE YOU NEED
A PURPLE FLAME CRYSTAL

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,402
AND THE SKIN OF A WINGED
DRAGON TO MAKE ONE.

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,138
RIGHT.

14
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:39,339
I QUESTED FOR THE ITEMS,

15
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,976
AND THEN I HAD SOMEONE
MAKE IT FOR ME.

16
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,511
[SHIROE, THINKING] HE KNOWS
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS

17
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,682
FOR THE LEVEL 45 QUEST,
"GET THE MAGIC BAG."

18
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,117
EVERYONE DOES IT EVENTUALLY.

19
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,219
WHO IS THIS GUY?

20
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,215
[TOYA] TOMORROW, WE'LL GO
IN THE AFTERNOON.

21
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,584
[ALL] RIGHT.

22
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,519
[TOYA] AS LONG AS WE GET
AT LEAST AN HOUR'S REST,

23
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,454
WE SHOULD COMPLETELY
RESTORE OUR POINTS.

24
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,388
[RUDY] YUP.

25
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,090
[SERARA] OK. BUT
THEY'RE ONLY GONNA

26
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,893
LET US INTO THE DUNGEON
ONCE A DAY ANYWAY.

27
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,663
[NAOTSUGU] THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

28
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,097
[TOYA] MASTER NAOTSUGU!

29
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,668
AND IF YOU TRY GOING
BACK IN, WE'LL SEND
YOU BACK TO AKIHABARA.

30
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:48,802
[RUDY] BUT MASTER!

31
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,470
[NAOTSUGU] ADVENTURERS
SHOULD FOLLOW THE RULES

32
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,606
SET DOWN FOR THEM ALL THE TIME.

33
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,209
PART OF YOUR JOB IS ENSURING
YOU GET ENOUGH REST.

34
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,078
(TOYA GRUMBLES)

35
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,446
(MINORI WHIMPERS SOFTLY)

36
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,522
[REGAN] I'M SORRY.
BACK AT THE PALACE,

37
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,290
I REFERRED TO
MYSELF AS A MAGE.

38
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,192
HOWEVER, IT MIGHT BE
MORE PRECISE TO SAY

39
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,761
I AM A PRACTITIONER
OF MAGICAL SCIENCES.

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,996
[SHIROE] HMM.

41
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,298
THE MAGICIAN OF MIRROR LAKE,

42
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,634
AT YOUR SERVICE, SIR.

43
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,969
REGAN.

44
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,838
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

45
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,208
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE
THE MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE?

46
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,143
[AKATSUKI] DO YOU KNOW
OF HIM, MY LORD?

47
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,012
WHEN I WAS PLAYING,
HIS NAME CAME UP A LOT

48
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:36,517
IN TOWN RUMORS AND IN
THE DESCRIPTIONS OF
A FEW OF THE QUESTS.

49
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,951
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MAIN ITEM

50
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,920
FOR THE 9 DUNGEONS
OF THE HALOS RAID,

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,287
THE KEY OF ETERNAL DARKNESS,

52
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,790
WAS SAID TO HAVE BEEN
MADE BY SOMEONE CALLED

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,726
THE MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE.

54
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:46,993
HMM.

55
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,229
[SHIROE] YOU KNOW AS WELL AS
I DO THAT GAME DEVELOPERS

56
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,632
WILL CREATE A NAME FOR A
PERSON THAT YOU NEVER SEE

57
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,834
TO MAKE A QUEST
MORE INTERESTING.

58
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,569
I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS REAL.

59
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,905
I GAINED THE TITLE MYSELF
FROM MY OLD MASTER,

60
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,108
BUT I REALLY HADN'T BEEN
USING IT MUCH SINCE THEN.

61
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,944
[SHIROE] SO THEN,
YOU INHERITED THE NAME

62
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,679
"THE MAGE OF MIRROR LAKE"?

63
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:06,847
[REGAN] CORRECT.

64
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,849
[SHIROE, THINKING]
WOW. I CAN'T BEGIN TO DESCRIBE

65
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,450
HOW IMPORTANT THIS GUY IS.

66
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:14,688
THIS IS AN AMAZING CHANCE
TO LEARN HOW THIS WORLD WORKS.

67
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,223
[REGAN] MAGIC IS A
CURIOUS THING, MY FRIEND.

68
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,760
WIDELY VARIED WITH MANY TYPES.

69
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,895
MY OWN SPECIALTY IS
A LITTLE SOMETHING

70
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,832
THAT I LIKE TO REFER TO
AS "WORLD CLASS" MAGIC
AND ENCHANTMENTS.

71
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,002
[SHIROE] "WORLD CLASS"?
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.

72
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,571
[REGAN] LET'S FIRST
CLASSIFY MAGIC

73
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,606
BY THE SPELL'S
AREA OF EFFECT.

74
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:35,041
ACTION CLASS, COMBAT CLASS,

75
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,477
OPERATION CLASS,
TACTICAL CLASS,

76
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:41,114
STRATEGY, NATIONAL DEFENSE
CLASS, CONTINENT CLASS,

77
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:44,317
AND FINALLY,
THERE'S WORLD CLASS.

78
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,553
[SHIROE] ISN'T MAGIC
USUALLY DIVIDED BY TYPE?

79
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,289
[REGAN] TRUE, BUT WHEN YOU
CONSIDER THE SCALE OF A SPELL,

80
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,957
YOU START ALLOWING
YOURSELF TO UNDERSTAND

81
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,294
HOW IT WORKS FROM A PERSPECTIVE
OF NUMBERS OF PERSONS AFFECTED,

82
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,297
OR SPECIFICALLY, THE
PHENOMENOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

83
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,432
ACTION CLASS MAGIC
REFERS TO THOSE SPELLS

84
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:02,235
THAT REPLICATE OR REPLACE
A SINGLE PHYSICAL ACTION

85
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,704
WITH AN ENERGETIC RESPONSE.

86
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,472
FOR EXAMPLE, SWINGING A SWORD
AND FIGHTING A MONSTER.

87
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,475
THE ACTION CLASS EQUIVALENT
IS A LIGHTNING BOLT.

88
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,845
COMBAT CLASS MAGIC IS
CAPABLE OF ALTERING

89
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,881
THE OVERALL OUTCOME
OF A SINGLE BATTLE.

90
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,350
ANY SPELL THAT CAN
ATTACK OR STRIKE DOWN

91
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,687
LARGE MOBS OR ENTIRE
COMBAT TEAMS OF ENEMIES

92
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,122
IS COMBAT CLASS.

93
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,190
AND THEN THERE'S
OPERATION CLASS MAGIC,

94
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,328
WHICH CAN ALTER THE COURSE OF
TWO OR 3 BATTLES AT A TIME.

95
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,064
TACTICAL GOES ONE STEP FURTHER.

96
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,666
A CASTER OF A
TACTICAL CLASS SPELL

97
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,870
COULD CONCEIVABLY CONQUER A
STRUCTURE AS LARGE AS A CASTLE.

98
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,141
DOES THAT MEAN HE COULD ALSO
DESTROY AN ENTIRE DUNGEON?

99
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,977
[SHIROE, THINKING] THE GAME
DOESN'T HAVE SPELLS LIKE THAT.

100
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,879
AND I DON'T, EITHER.

101
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,214
STRATEGIC CLASS WOULD
BE A SINGLE SPELL

102
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,383
THAT COULD DECIDE
THE OUTCOME OF A WAR.

103
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,953
AND NATIONAL DEFENSE,
AN ENTIRE NATION.

104
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,856
AND OF COURSE,
CONTINENT CLASS, A CONTINENT.

105
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,859
AND THUS, WORLD CLASS.

106
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,828
[SHIROE] OK. A SPELL CAPABLE
OF CONTROLLING THE LAWS,

107
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:05,498
OR THE FATES, OR THE VERY
EXISTENCE OF AN ENTIRE WORLD.

108
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,734
[REGAN] EXACTLY,
MY FRIEND.

109
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,302
[AKATSUKI] UHH.

110
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,937
[SHIROE] MM...

111
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,473
[SHIROE] I UNDERSTAND
THE CONCEPT BEHIND
SPELLS THAT POWERFUL,

112
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,509
BUT HAS ANYONE EVER
ACTUALLY CAST ONE?

113
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:19,646
[REGAN] HMM. TO THE BEST OF MY
KNOWLEDGE, THERE IS ONE SPELL.

114
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,048
IT'S BEEN CAST 3 TIMES.

115
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:28,822
IT'S CALLED "THE WORLD
FRACTION GLOBAL ENCHANTMENT."

116
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,924
[SHIROE] OH.

117
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:32,526
THE APOCALYPSE.

118
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,094
[AKATSUKI] UHH.

119
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,330
[REGAN] HMM. I INVITED YOU HERE
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOU,

120
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,566
OF ALL THE ADVENTURERS
WHO HAVE BEEN STUCK HERE,

121
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,168
MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE
INSIGHT INTO THE MATTER.

122
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,906
[SHIROE] OF COURSE. BUT I
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU, TOO.

123
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:50,811
TO PUT IT MILDLY, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT LED TO US BEING HERE.

124
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,213
AND WE WOULD REALLY
LIKE TO FIND OUT.

125
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,482
[REGAN] I'D BE HAPPY TO TELL YOU
ANYTHING I KNOW, OF COURSE.

126
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,318
[SHIROE] THEN I'LL
START WITH THIS.

127
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,686
THE FRACTION SPELL.

128
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:02,222
I GUESS THE BEST THING TO KNOW
ABOUT IT WOULD BE,

129
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,324
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
THE OTHER TWO USES?

130
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,226
THAT IS QUITE A LONG STORY.

131
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,061
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

132
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,229
[SHIROE] DEFINITELY.

133
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,064
[REGAN] WELL, THEN, AS THEY SAY,

134
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,866
FIRST THINGS FIRST.

135
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:24,945
[MINORI, THINKING]
FORMATION, OPERATOR,
FIELD MONITOR, PATROL TEAMS.

136
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:31,685
OK. I REMEMBER EVERYTHING
SHIROE TAUGHT ME ABOUT
FIGHTING IN A PARTY.

137
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,356
BUT WHY AM I SO NERVOUS?

138
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,727
I FEEL LIKE I MUST BE
MISSING SOMETHING.

139
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,196
[REGAN] APPROXIMATELY
350 YEARS AGO,

140
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,868
THE WORLD IS SAID TO HAVE
BEEN A FAR MORE PROSPEROUS
PLACE THAN TODAY.

141
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,935
(PLANES SOARING)

142
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,471
IT'S A PALE SHADOW
OF THE AGE OF GODS,

143
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,975
WHICH HAS PASSED INTO LEGEND.

144
00:07:55,075 --> 00:08:00,647
BUT DURING THAT TIME, HUMANS,
ELVES, DWARVES, AND ALVS...

145
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:03,684
THESE 4 RACES LIVED TOGETHER.

146
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,053
THE ALVS IN PARTICULAR
WERE MAGICAL INVENTORS

147
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,724
AND THE VANGUARD OF A
VAST MAGICAL CIVILIZATION.

148
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,795
SADLY, HOWEVER, THAT POWER
BECAME THEIR UNDOING.

149
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,262
[AKATSUKI] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

150
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,600
AS A RACE, THEIR REPRODUCTIVE
CAPACITY WAS QUITE SLIM,

151
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,102
AND THEIR NATION WAS SMALL.

152
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,506
THEY WERE DESPISED FOR
THEIR MONOPOLY OVER
MAGICAL TECHNOLOGY,

153
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:30,110
SO THE OTHER RACES USED
THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS
TO ERADICATE THEM.

154
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:32,245
THEN WHAT ABOUT ME?

155
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,548
MY RACE IS
TECHNICALLY HALF‐ALV.

156
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,982
[REGAN] IN THE PERIOD
THAT FOLLOWED,

157
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,419
THE FEW SURVIVING ALVS
WERE KEPT AS SLAVES.

158
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,524
THEIR DESCENDANTS
ARE THE HALF‐ALVS.

159
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:47,661
IN ANY EVENT, THE ALV
KINGDOM WAS DESTROYED.

160
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:53,900
AND THEN THE 6 BENT PRINCESSES,
THE LUQUENJE, WERE BORN.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,669
[AKATSUKI] "6 BENT PRINCESSES"?

162
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,070
[SHIROE] "LUQUENJE"?

163
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,873
[REGAN] EACH OF THE 6 WERE
UNAWARE OF THE OTHER 5,

164
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,242
SO THEY WERE NOT ACTING
TOGETHER AT ALL.

165
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:07,548
HOWEVER, DRIVEN BY ANGER
OVER THE DESTRUCTION OF
THEIR RACE AND THEIR CULTURE,

166
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,551
ALL OF THESE ALV
WOMEN SOUGHT REVENGE,

167
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,119
UNINTENTIONALLY
AT THE SAME TIME.

168
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,122
SOME OF THEM SEDUCED
MEN OF GREAT POWER.

169
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:20,093
SOME LED THE REMAINING ALVS
IN IMPROVISED ARMIES.

170
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,928
(EXPLOSION)

171
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:26,066
AND THE WORLD WAS PLUNGED
INTO A BUBBLING CAULDRON
OF CHAOS ONCE MORE.

172
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,569
BUT IN THE END,
ALL 6 OF THE PRINCESSES

173
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,004
WERE LEFT ON THE
VERGE OF DEFEAT,

174
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,906
AND ALL SEEMED LOST.

175
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,474
AND THAT WAS WHEN
THEY DECIDED TO CAST

176
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,610
THE FIRST WORLD FRACTION SPELL.

177
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,046
AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO
DECIDED TO CAST IT WERE ALVS?

178
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,115
[REGAN] PRECISELY.
BUT THE TECHNOLOGIES

179
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:46,119
AND PRINCIPLES USED REMAIN
DEEPLY SHROUDED IN MYSTERY.

180
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,723
AND THE SPELL BROUGHT
ABOUT THE GENESIS

181
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,258
OF THE DEMI‐HUMANS.

182
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,359
(SHIROE GASPS)

183
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,861
[REGAN] UNTIL 300 YEARS AGO,

184
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,931
THERE WERE NO DEMI‐HUMANS.

185
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,833
AS TO HOW THEY WERE CREATED,

186
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,004
REPEATED WAR HAD DECREASED
THE POPULATION...

187
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,140
LEAVING THE PLANET
OVERRUN WITH SOULS.

188
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,647
IT IS MY BELIEF THAT
THOSE SURPLUS SOULS

189
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:18,151
WERE UTILIZED IN THE
CREATION OF THE DEMI‐HUMANS.

190
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,387
THE WARS WITH THE DEMI‐HUMANS
PUSHED HUMANITY TO THE BRINK,

191
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,891
AND THE WORLD SANK
INTO A DARK AGE.

192
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,794
HUMANITY DEFEATED
THE LUQUENJE, OF COURSE,

193
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,930
BUT THE PRINCESSES'
PLANS FOR REVENGE

194
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,398
HAD ULTIMATELY BEEN
PROVEN SUCCESSFUL.

195
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,834
[SHIROE] HMM.

196
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,837
HUMANITY, FACED WITH AN
OVERRUN OF DEMI‐HUMAN RACES,

197
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,974
USED ALV MAGICAL SECRETS TO
ADD ALLIES TO THEIR NUMBERS.

198
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:44,511
AND SO THE CAT
PEOPLE, WOLF FANGS,

199
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,279
FOX TAILS, AND ROBED ONES

200
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,750
JOINED THE RANKS OF HUMANITY
TO FIGHT DEMI‐HUMANS.

201
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,654
THIS ALSO COINCIDED WITH THE
CREATION OF THE PRECURSORS.

202
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,522
[SHIROE] THE PRECURSORS
ARE AMONG THE MOST

203
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,157
POWERFUL NON‐PLAYER CHARACTERS,

204
00:10:57,257 --> 00:11:00,761
WITH STRENGTH RIVALING
THAT OF ADVENTURERS.

205
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,163
AS YOU KNOW FROM
THE STORY OF THE GAME,

206
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:06,499
PRECURSORS ARE CONSIDERED
TO BE LEGENDARY HEROES.

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,671
[REGAN] WE CAN DISCUSS
THE PRECURSORS AT ANOTHER
TIME, OF COURSE.

208
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,373
THE ISSUE NOW AT HAND
SEEMS TO BE SOULS.

209
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:17,844
IN MAGICAL SCIENCE TERMS,
WE REFER TO THIS AS
SPIRITUAL THEORY.

210
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,112
[SHIROE] "SPIRITUAL THEORY"?

211
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,914
[REGAN] AND IN SPITE OF
USING THE PROCESS

212
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,549
TO CREATE ALLIES
OF THEIR OWN,

213
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,151
HUMANITY COULDN'T
STOP THE ONSLAUGHT.

214
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,954
SO, NO MATTER HOW MANY
DEMI‐HUMANS ONE DEFEATED,

215
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,190
THEY WERE ALWAYS
REINCARNATING.

216
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,226
WHICH MEANS THEY CAN
NEVER REALLY BE DEFEATED.

217
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,962
[SHIROE, THINKING]
IS HE TALKING ABOUT RESPAWNS?

218
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,999
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
PART OF THE GAME.

219
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,034
[SHIROE, VOICE‐OVER] SAY YOU
KILL EVERY MONSTER IN A ZONE,

220
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,304
THERE'D BE NOTHING LEFT FOR
OTHER PLAYERS WITHOUT RESPAWNS.

221
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,373
NO FIGHTS, NO EXPERIENCE POINTS,
NO LEVELING UP.

222
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,710
HOWEVER, A TIMER IN THE
GAME ALWAYS MAKES SURE

223
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,212
THE ZONE IS REPOPULATED
FOR A FIGHT,

224
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,580
AND THAT'S RESPAWNING.

225
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,783
[REGAN] THE CONSTANT BATTLES
WITH THE DEMI‐HUMANS RAGED ON.

226
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,753
BUT 60 YEARS AFTER THE
FIRST WORLD FRACTION,

227
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,623
HUMANITY WAS NEARLY ANNIHILATED.

228
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,458
AND THEN, A DIVINE
SUMMONING SPELL WAS USED,

229
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,929
AND MESSENGERS OF GOD MADE
THEIR WAY TO THIS WORLD.

230
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,135
THIS WAS 240 YEARS AGO.

231
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,805
THE SECOND WORLD FRACTION.

232
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,476
WHICH HERALDED THE APPEARANCE
OF THE ADVENTURERS.

233
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,148
[SHIROE] 240 YEARS AGO.

234
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,551
SO TELL ME, WHY DID YOU
WANT TO TALK TO ME

235
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,385
ABOUT ALL THIS
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

236
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,820
[REGAN] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

237
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,256
[SHIROE] THERE ARE OTHER
ROUND TABLE REPRESENTATIVES.

238
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,259
THERE ARE OTHER REPRESENTATIVES,
BUT YOU'RE A MASTER MAGE.

239
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,462
YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING OF THIS
THAN THEY DO.

240
00:12:42,563 --> 00:12:44,731
UHH! WAIT, AN ARCH‐MAGE?

241
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,667
IS THAT REALLY TRUE, MY LORD?

242
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:48,201
[SHIROE] I DON'T KNOW.

243
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,870
OUR HISTORY BOOKS
STARTED DETAILING

244
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,840
THE DEEDS OF THE MASTER
MAGE SHIROE 98 YEARS AGO.

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,042
IN FACT, THE TIME
YOU'VE BEEN ACTIVE ALONE

246
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,345
IS PROOF THAT YOU'RE A
MASTER MAGE IN THIS WORLD.

247
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,314
98 YEARS AGO?

248
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,784
I KNOW YOU CAN'T BE
THAT OLD, MY LORD.

249
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,318
[SHIROE]
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

250
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,987
[SHIROE, THINKING] WAIT!

251
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,322
I JUST REMEMBERED...
5 MINUTES OF PLAYING TIME

252
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:12,292
IS EQUAL TO AN HOUR
ON THE GAME TIMER.

253
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:17,030
IN OTHER WORDS,
ONE DAY IN THE GAME
EQUALS TWO REAL‐WORLD HOURS.

254
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,399
SO 98 OF THEIR YEARS

255
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,968
IS A LITTLE MORE THAN
8 YEARS FOR US.

256
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,338
SO WHAT WAS I DOING
8 YEARS AND 3 MONTHS AGO?

257
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,675
OF COURSE. THAT'S WHEN
I STARTED PLAYING ELDER TALES.

258
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,176
(GASP)

259
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,947
ADVENTURERS FIRST APPEARED IN
THEIR WORLD 240 YEARS AGO,

260
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,982
OR 20 YEARS AGO FOR US.

261
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:37,751
THAT MAKES SENSE, TOO.

262
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:42,455
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY
STARTED THE OPEN BETA TEST
FOR THE GAME ONLINE.

263
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,398
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

264
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,902
[TAKAYAMA] HONESTLY,
I WAS EXPECTING MORE NOBLES
TO ASK US FOR TROOPS.

265
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:00,941
[KRUSTY] YES. MOST OF THEM
WANT TECHNOLOGY SHARING
OR TRADE AGREEMENTS.

266
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,544
[MICHITAKA] THEY KNEW ALL
ABOUT THE STEAM ENGINE.

267
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:07,714
[TAKAYAMA] AND WE KNOW
THEY HAD SPIES CRAWLING ALL
OVER THE PLACE IN AKIHABARA.

268
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:12,385
[SHIROE] KNOWING ABOUT IT
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'D BE ABLE
TO MAKE ONE THAT EASILY.

269
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,687
[KRUSTY] SHIROE'S RIGHT.

270
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:15,756
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT NOW.

271
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,458
[MICHITAKA] WHAT ABOUT
A FEW YEARS FROM NOW?

272
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:22,863
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD.

273
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,565
[SHIROE] HM?

274
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,067
THINKING ABOUT
YESTERDAY?

275
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,268
I AM.

276
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,405
[SHIROE] WHAT IS THIS SPIRITUAL
THEORY YOU MENTIONED?

277
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:37,010
THE ENERGY THAT ANIMATES
ALL LIVING THINGS IS COMMONLY
REFERRED TO AS THE SPIRIT.

278
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,146
AND SPIRIT ITSELF CAN BE
DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPONENTS...

279
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,382
THE PSYCHE AND THE ANIMA.

280
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,251
PSYCHE IS THE ENERGY
THAT ANIMATES THE MIND,

281
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,188
AND IT AFFECTS THINGS
SUCH AS MAGIC AS WELL.

282
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,825
YOU CALL IT MP,
OR MAGIC POINTS.

283
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:55,328
ANIMA IS THE ENERGY
THAT ANIMATES THE BODY.

284
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,764
YOU CALL THEM
HIT POINTS, OR HEALTH.

285
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,201
IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS KI, OR CHI.

286
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,036
WHEN SOMEONE IS
DEFEATED IN BATTLE,

287
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,170
THEY CAN NO LONGER MOVE,

288
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,406
BUT THE MIND STILL
REMAINS HEALTHY.

289
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:07,908
[SMASH] UHH.

290
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,644
[REGAN] HOWEVER, THE ANIMA
AND PSYCHE ARE SPLIT,

291
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,915
AND THE PSYCHE BECOMES
TRAPPED IN DARKNESS AS
THE BODY ITSELF FAILS.

292
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:18,351
THIS IS BECAUSE THE
INFORMATION THAT FLOWS
TO THE MIND FROM THE BODY,

293
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:21,087
WHICH SENSES LIGHT,
HAS BEEN CUT OFF.

294
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:25,325
THEN THE DISPERSAL OF
THE BODY, THE ANIMA, BEGINS.

295
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,729
THIS PROCESS IS CALLED
ANIMA‐DISPERSAL.

296
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,432
RESURRECTION MAGIC CAN BE USED
ON CORPSES IN THIS STATE.

297
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,668
THE PROCESS GATHERS
AND RECONSTRUCTS THE ANIMA

298
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:38,071
THAT HAS OTHERWISE DISPERSED
AFTER A PHYSICAL DEATH.

299
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,306
THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR THE
RECONSTRUCTION IS DERIVED BY

300
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:45,445
CALCULATING BACKWARDS FROM THE
INFORMATION LEFT IN THE CORPSE.

301
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,413
WITH THE CORPSE CONTAINING
ITS OWN BLUEPRINT,

302
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,317
THE HEALER SIMPLY PROVIDES
THE ENERGY TO EFFECT
THE RESURRECTION.

303
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,419
[SHIROE] HOWEVER,
PIECES ARE ALWAYS MISSING,

304
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,090
SO ANY RESTORATION IS
AN IMPERFECT TASK AT BEST.

305
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,493
AND THAT'S WHY YOU LOSE
EXPERIENCE AFTER RESURRECTION.

306
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,696
[REGAN] BECAUSE DECAY
STARTS IMMEDIATELY,

307
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,464
YOU'LL ALWAYS LOSE SOMETHING.

308
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:07,968
NATURALLY, IF THE BODY,
THE ANIMA, DISPERSES COMPLETELY,

309
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,770
RESURRECTION BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE.

310
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,339
AND OF COURSE, PEOPLE OF THE
LAND PERISH AT THIS POINT.

311
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,342
OK, BUT WHAT
ABOUT BEFORE THEN?

312
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:20,013
[REGAN] RESURRECTION MAGIC WILL
WORK ON PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

313
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:23,249
FOR AN ADVENTURER, THOUGH,
ONCE HIS ANIMA IS DISPERSED,

314
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,587
HIS BODY DECOMPOSES
INTO PARTICLES AND
THE PSYCHE, THE MIND,

315
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:30,757
USES ITS POWER TO
TRANSPORT THE ADVENTURER
TO THE CATHEDRAL.

316
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,626
YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS, I'M SURE.

317
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:36,997
THIS SYSTEM IS QUITE SIMILAR
TO THAT OF THE DEMI‐HUMANS
AND THEIR RESPAWNS.

318
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,332
OF COURSE, THIS IS NOTHING
MORE THAN A HYPOTHESIS

319
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,836
THAT MY MASTER AND I WERE
RESEARCHING QUITE A WHILE AGO.

320
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:44,204
[SHIROE] DID YOU CONSIDER
THE POSSIBILITY

321
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,173
THAT DEMI‐HUMANS HAD
MEMORIES BEFORE THEY DIED?

322
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:48,909
[REGAN] ACTUALLY, NO.

323
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,877
AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONALITY
AND CONSCIOUSNESS

324
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,747
ARE STORED INSIDE THE
PSYCHE AS INFORMATION.

325
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:59,252
MEMORIES, HOWEVER, ARE ALSO
STORED WITHIN THE BRAIN.

326
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,855
THE BODY, OF COURSE,
BEING ANIMA.

327
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,423
[SHIROE] SO YOU'RE
SAYING MEMORIES EXIST

328
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:06,627
BOTH WITHIN THE ANIMA
AND THE PSYCHE.

329
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:11,264
WOULDN'T THAT MEAN THAT
MEMORIES COULD BE LOST EVERY
TIME SOMEONE REINCARNATES?

330
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,634
[REGAN] OH. NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT.

331
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:15,536
I DON'T SEE HOW SOMEONE
COULD GO THROUGH

332
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:18,639
SOMETHING THAT TRAUMATIC AND
NOT LOSE A MEMORY OR TWO.

333
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:20,073
(SHIROE SIGHS)

334
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,908
[REGAN] THE FIRST
WORLD FRACTION CURSE

335
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:27,013
USED EXISTING SOULS TO
MAKE UNREASONING FIGHTING
MONSTERS OUT OF THEM.

336
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,782
THEIR OLD MEMORIES MAY BE THERE,

337
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:33,186
BUT THE MONSTERS THEY'VE
BECOME WOULD HAVE NO WAY
TO RECOGNIZE THEM.

338
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:37,891
[REGAN] THE MEMORIES OF WHAT
THEY ONCE WERE MIGHT BE LIKE
A DREAM OR A STORY.

339
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:42,062
[SHIROE, THINKING] DOES THAT
MEAN WE COULD WIND UP LOSING
OUR MEMORIES AS WELL?

340
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,464
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD.
[SHIROE] UHH.

341
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,668
[AKATSUKI] MM.
[SHIROE] UH, HEH, HEH.

342
00:17:47,768 --> 00:17:50,771
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

343
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:51,905
[SHIROE] HUH.

344
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,173
[AKATSUKI] IF WE DIE
IN THIS WORLD,

345
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,076
DON'T WE SIMPLY REVIVE
AT THE CATHEDRAL?

346
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:03,216
THE PERSON SITTING AT
THE COMPUTER PLAYING THE
ELDER TALES GAME IS THE MIND.

347
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,851
IN OTHER WORDS, THE PSYCHE.

348
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:10,056
THE CHARACTER INSIDE THE SCREEN
IS THE BODY, THE ANIMA.

349
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:14,595
NATURALLY, THE PLAYER IS THE
ONE WITH THE MEMORIES OF WHAT
HAPPENED DURING THE GAME,

350
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:18,699
BUT THE PLAYER'S CHARACTER IS
THE ONE WITH THE EXPERIENCE,
THE ITEMS, THE LEVELS,

351
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,267
AND OTHER TYPES OF POINTS.

352
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,969
UNTIL NOW, IF A CHARACTER DIED,

353
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:25,772
IT ONLY MEANT LOSING
EXPERIENCE IN THE GAME.

354
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:26,907
[IN‐GAME SHIROE] UHH.

355
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:27,874
[SHIROE] THE REAL‐WORLD
DISCONNECT

356
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:29,776
MEANT IT DIDN'T HURT US.

357
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:34,180
HOWEVER, NOW OUR PSYCHE
AND ANIMA, THEY'RE
IN THE SAME PLACE,

358
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,650
SO WE DON'T GET THAT SAME
PROTECTION WE USED TO HAVE.

359
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,719
[AKATSUKI] SO WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING IS...

360
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,122
[SHIROE] IT MEANS OUR MEMORIES
AND OUR EXPERIENCE POINTS
ARE NOW THE SAME,

361
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,124
BUT IRREPLACEABLE.

362
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,828
IF WE DIE, WE'LL LOSE
OUR MEMORIES...

363
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:49,863
LIKE OUR EXPERIENCE.

364
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,632
UHH!

365
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:55,235
[SHIROE] BUT I HAVE NO
IDEA HOW MUCH WE'D LOSE.

366
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,938
SINCE WE CAME TO THIS WORLD,
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED,

367
00:18:58,038 --> 00:18:59,640
BUT NONE OF THEM
HAVE COMPLAINED,

368
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,908
SO IT MAY BE NOTHING.

369
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,313
IT MAY BE NO MORE THAN
JUST A LITTLE FORGETFULNESS.

370
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:09,783
[AKATSUKI] YEAH, BUT EVEN SO...

371
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,253
[SHIROE] OR MAYBE YOU FORGET
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE YOU DID.

372
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:17,390
JUST THINK IF YOU FORGOT
ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.

373
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,162
ANYWAY, IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF
WE SIT ON THIS FOR A WHILE.

374
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,764
[SHIROE] OK?

375
00:19:23,864 --> 00:19:25,566
YES.

376
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,637
(ISUZU YAWNS)
GOOD MORNING.

377
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,105
MORNING, ISUZU.

378
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,507
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

379
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:36,677
I KNOW.
I REALLY COULDN'T
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

380
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,078
ME, TOO, I GUESS.

381
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,147
I WONDER IF IT'LL
GO WELL TODAY...

382
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,683

383
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,751
[ISUZU] UHH. MMM‐WAH.

384
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,987
I THINK I'LL GET A BATH
IN WHILE IT'S EARLY!

385
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:49,189
[MINORI] OH? OK. SEE YA.

386
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,424

387
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,425
HUH?

388
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,027
(TOYA GRUNTING SOFTLY)

389
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,529
[MINORI] TOYA. GOOD MORNING.

390
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,763

391
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,735
[MINORI] HMM.

393
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,010

AHH‐AHH!

(PANTING)

396
00:20:17,851 --> 00:20:18,952
HUH?

397
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,555
HOLD ON A SECOND.

398
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,089
[ISUZU, THINKING] THOSE
ARE DUNGEON CORRIDORS.

399
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,324
(RUDY BREATHING HEAVILY)

400
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,326
[ISUZU, THINKING]
HE'S PRACTICING.

401
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,361
HUH?

402
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,131
[ISUZU] OH! UH, SORRY!

403
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,133
WELL, HELLO, MISS ISUZU!

404
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,801
SPLENDID MORNING, MADAME?!

405
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,704
[ISUZU] THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
MUCH, DON'T YOU THINK?

406
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:39,740
[RUDY] AND WHAT
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

407
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,075
I WAS JUST TAKING MY
MORNING CONSTITUTIONAL,

408
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,777
INVITED BY THE FOREST
NYMPHS THEMSELVES

409
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,179
TO LISTEN TO THE BIRDS
AND THEIR SYMPHONY.

410
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,480
HEE HEE. UH...

411
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,015
WELL, IF YOU
SAY SO.

412
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,316
I DO.

413
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,252
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT
HERE ON THIS FINE DAY?

414
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,887
THOUGHT I'D GET
A BATH IN.

415
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,390
HEY, I KNOW!
WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN
TO THE STREAM WITH ME?

416
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,192
[RUDY] TO THE‐
TO THE BATH!

417
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,094
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN
BEING A PEEPING TOM

418
00:21:01,194 --> 00:21:02,829
WHO STARES AT WOMEN
WHO ARE BATHING!

419
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,430
DON'T INSULT ME
LIKE THAT.

420
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:07,100
[ISUZU] I WASN'T TELLING YOU
TO COME STARE AT ME, YOU DUMMY!

421
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,603
I MEANT YOU WOULDN'T WANT A LADY
TO WALK THROUGH THE FOREST

422
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,938
BY HERSELF AND
GET HURT, WOULD YOU?

423
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,339
OH. I SEE...

424
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,576
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I GUESS I COULD‐

425
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,944
YES! I'LL GLADLY
ESCORT YOU!

426
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,713
IT WOULD BE MY HONOR, MA'AM.

427
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:22,649
SO, WHICH WAY IS
THIS SPRING OF YOURS?

428
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:24,551
(ISUZU GIGGLES)

429
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,587
[ISUZU] THAT WAY, RUNDELLHAUS.

430
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:30,423
[RUDY] MISS ISUZU, PLEASE.
MY PARENTS CALL ME RUNDELLHAUS.

431
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,292
JUST CALL ME RUDY.

432
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,161
(RAIN FALLING)

433
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,198
MM! DELICIOSO!

434
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,033
ANOTHER WONDERFUL
BREAKFAST TODAY.

435
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,234
DON'T YOU ALL THINK SO?

436
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,269
MY MOUTH IS IN FOOD HEAVEN.

437
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,672
IT'S NYANTA'S
SPECIAL RECIPE!

438
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,774
RUDY, YOU OUGHT
TO GIVE THIS A TRY!

439
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,442
[MINORI] HMM?
WHAT'D YOU CALL HIM?

440
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:52,045
[RUDY] MM‐MMM!
MASHED PUMPKIN SALAD.

441
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,014
THIS IS TRULY
AN EXQUISITE TASTE.

442
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,883
SO REFINED, SO YUMMY
IN MY TUMMY.

443
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:57,951
[MINORI] OH.

444
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,152
HEY, YOU GUYS.

445
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:00,921
G‐G‐G‐G‐I'M SO SORRY!

446
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,255
THERE'S NO MORE SOUP!

447
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,724
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING MORE FOR US!

448
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,725
I'M SORRY!

449
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,628
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT THAT. HMM.

450
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:09,029
[MINORI] UH?

451
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:12,833
[MINORI, THINKING] TOYA'S GOT
THE SAME THING ON HIS MIND I DO.

452
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:16,469
[TOYA] SO GUYS, I WAS
THINKING, YOU KNOW...

453
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,704
[MINORI, THINKING] WAIT...

454
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:20,306
I DON'T WANT IT TO END
UP LIKE LAST TIME.

455
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:24,444
IF I'M TOO SCARED TO SAY IT,
NOTHING WILL CHANGE.

456
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,280
I'VE GOTTA SAY SOMETHING.

457
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,082
[RUDY] ALL RIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DONE HERE.

458
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,517
LET'S GET OUR GEAR TOGETHER

459
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:32,719
AND HEAD OUT TO THE DUNGEON
AND PRACTICE, YOU GUYS.

460
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:35,488
TODAY I'LL FINALLY‐
[MINORI] OH, COME ON!

461
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:37,457
[ALL BUT MINORI] HUH?

462
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:38,725
[MINORI] LOOK, YOU GUYS.

463
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,027
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO,

464
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,063
OR WE WON'T BE
ABLE TO WIN THIS.

465
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,791
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THE REAL ANSWER ISN'T
WRITTEN DOWN ANYWHERE.

466
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:20,293
NOT IN A TEXTBOOK,
NOT ON THE INTERNET,

467
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:22,295
AND NOT IN YOUR NOTEBOOK.

468
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:24,865
AND NO ONE CAN TEACH
IT TO YOU, EITHER.

469
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,901
BUT WHEN YOU FINALLY
UNDERSTAND IT ON YOUR OWN,

470
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:32,338
WHAT WAS ONCE MERELY A PARTY
BECOMES A GROUP OF TRUE FRIENDS.

471
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,274
NEXT TIME ON "LOG HORIZON."

472
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:37,110
[SHIROE] ALWAYS LOOK
30 SECONDS AHEAD.
