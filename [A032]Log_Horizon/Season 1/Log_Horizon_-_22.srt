(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

2
00:00:06,712 --> 00:00:10,379
[NAOTSUGU, MUFFLED]
SO THE BIG‐SCALE FESTIVAL
STARTS TOMORROW, HUH?

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,212
EVERYBODY'S PRETTY FREAKING
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,379
[NYANTA] WELL, IT'S OUR FIRST
FESTIVAL IN AKIHABARA, HUH?

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:18,612
SINCE WE ALL DECIDED TO
MAKE THIS HAPPEN, HMM.

6
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:21,779
MANY OF THE GUILDS DECIDED TO
PITCH IN AND MAKE IT GREAT.

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,345
YOU AIN'T LYING.

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:24,945
(SMASH LAUGHING)
[NAOTSUGU] JUST HEARING
THERE'S A FESTIVAL

9
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,545
MAKES A LOT OF PEOPLE
WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING.

10
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:28,779
[MARIELLE] AH.

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,145
[NAOTSUGU]
DECORATIONS?

12
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,045
[NYANTA] YOU GOT YOURSELF
QUITE A HAUL THERE.

13
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:35,012
[MARIELLE] I, LIKE, CAN'T EVEN
FIT THEM INTO MY MAGIC BAG!

14
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,845
[NAOTSUGU] I HEARD THAT THE
CRESCENT MOON ALLIANCE IS

15
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:39,279
GONNA BE SELLING WINTER
CLOTHES OR SOMETHING.

16
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,079
[MARIELLE] WE'RE ALSO
DOING A FASHION SHOW.

17
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,012
[NAOTSUGU] SWEET!
[NYANTA] OH, I LIKE THAT.

18
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:46,045
[MARIELLE] WE'RE DOING IT
ALL TOMORROW, SO, LIKE,

19
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,112
WE'VE GOT TO GET
EVERYTHING READY TODAY.

20
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:49,879
DON'T WORK TOO
HARD, MARIELLE.

21
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,645
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BRINGING
BACK THE CRESCENT BURGER, HMM?

22
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,179
[MARIELLE] YOU'VE GOT IT!

23
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,245
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO
WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON?

24
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,779
[NYANTA] I'LL BE CONTENT
JUST ROAMING AROUND,

25
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,445
BROWSING THE SHOPS. MYEAH.

26
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:04,145
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, I'M
GONNA EAT. AND THEN I'M
GONNA EAT SOME MORE!

27
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:05,912
AND AKATSUKI
AND THE OTHERS?

28
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,379
[NYANTA] I DON'T THINK THEY'VE
MENTIONED ANY PLANS, HMM?

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,879
[NAOTSUGU] WELL, I'M SURE
THEY'LL FIND SOMETHING TO DO.

30
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,145
[KANAKO] HERE YOU GO.
TAKE ONE. HERE YOU GO.

31
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:19,445
BRING A FRIEND AND
COME AS A COUPLE.

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,579
HM!

33
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,945
ALL RIGHT! I'VE GOT
TO INVITE SHIROE!

34
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,286
[SHIROE] YOU ARE AS BIG A PART
OF THIS AS ANY ONE OF US.

35
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,686
I MEAN IT.

36
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,853
HM...

37
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,019
(SHIROE YAWNS)

38
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,253
(WIND BLOWS)

39
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,253
[SHIROE] AHH!

40
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:29,753
(GROWLS)

41
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:34,186
COME ON! ARE YOU
FREAKING KIDDING ME?! AAH!

42
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,553
HELLO, SHIROE.

43
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,019
[SHIROE] UH!

44
00:03:43,119 --> 00:03:45,553
[HENRIETTA] ARE YOU SHUTTING
YOURSELF UP IN HERE AGAIN?

45
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:49,986
[SHIROE] BETWEEN HANDLING
OUR PAPERWORK AND TRYING
TO LEARN MORE,

46
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:53,586
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER BEEN SO BUSY.

47
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:56,753
[SHIROE] HMM...
[HENRIETTA] OK, WELL, ARE YOU
EATING ENOUGH, SLEEPING ENOUGH?

48
00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,986
[SHIROE] YEAH, I'M
DOING WHAT I CAN.

49
00:03:59,086 --> 00:04:03,653
I TOOK A 15‐MINUTE NAP,
AND I ATE ALMOST 2 HOURS AGO.

50
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:05,753
[HENRIETTA] UH, OKEY‐DOKEY!
THAT'S FINE, THEN!

51
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:08,219
HERE IS THE INFORMATION
YOU REQUESTED. AHEM.

52
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,519
[SHIROE] THANKS FOR THAT.

53
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,119
I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO
PUT YOU OUT, THOUGH.

54
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:13,419
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE ME
A CALL, AND I WOULD HAVE COME.

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,719
[HENRIETTA] SO YOU SAY,
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE REALLY
ACTUALLY DONE IT?

56
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,386
YOU SEE, I'VE HEARD YOU'VE
BEEN LOCKED IN THIS ROOM
HERE FOR AGES UPON AGES.

57
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,019
SO I WANTED TO CHECK AND MAKE
SURE YOU WERE STILL ALIVE.

58
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:26,986
OK, YOU GOT ME. HOW'S THAT
SCALE FESTIVAL LOOKING?

59
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:28,819
[HENRIETTA] KARASHIN
IS DOING GREAT.

60
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,619
I MEAN, HE'S REALLY
TAKEN CHARGE OF THE EVENT.

61
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:32,986
[SHIROE] THE GUY
DOES GOOD WORK.

62
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,753
[HENRIETTA] YOU SHOULD
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR

63
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,486
AND TRY TO TAKE A BREAK
DURING THESE NEXT 3 DAYS.

64
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:39,919
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
I REALLY SHOULD.

65
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,486
THE FESTIVAL IS BOUND
TO BE PRETTY LOUD.

66
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,353
I CAN'T WORK
LIKE THAT.

67
00:04:44,453 --> 00:04:46,686
[HENRIETTA] OH, THAT
IS JUST NONSENSE!
[SHIROE] HUH?

68
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:51,319
[HENRIETTA] THIS IS A WONDERFUL
OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO BECOME
CLOSER TO YOUR GUILDMATES.

69
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,086
AND SINCE LOG HORIZON
IS OFFICIALLY ONE OF THE
GUILDS OF THE ROUND TABLE,

70
00:04:56,186 --> 00:05:00,319
YOU WILL BE OUT THERE MAKING
THE EVENT FUN AND DELIGHTFUL
AND SUPER!

71
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:01,686
UH, I GUESS
I'LL TRY.

72
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,519
THAT'S IT.
BE A GOOD BOY.

73
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:04,986
AGH, SURE!

74
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,819
[HENRIETTA] AKATSUKI AND
MINORI ARE SO FREAKING CUTE,

75
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,886
I'M LOSING MY MIND!

76
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,186
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE
ABLE TO CONTROL MYSELF!

77
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:13,053
WHAT'S THAT?

78
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:14,619
IT'S AN ADORABLE
AKATSUKI DOLL

79
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,153
ADORABLE AKATSUKI
GAVE ME!

80
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:18,719
(AKATSUKI SHUDDERS)
[SHIROE] IT'S SO CREEPY.

81
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,753
AS LONG AS I HAVE BOTH
OF MY AKATSUKIS,

82
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,453
I DON'T THINK I'LL
EVEN NEED TO EAT!

83
00:05:22,553 --> 00:05:25,019
[HENRIETTA] THEY SAY THAT A MAN
DOES NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE.

84
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,886
BUT WITH BREAD AND FANTASIES,

85
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,653
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ALMOST
ANYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO DO!

86
00:05:28,753 --> 00:05:30,386
WHOA, OH, WHOA!

87
00:05:30,486 --> 00:05:33,353
(SHIROE CHUCKLES)

88
00:05:34,619 --> 00:05:36,319
[SHIROE]
SHE'S GOT A POINT.

89
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,986
I GUESS IT WOULDN'T HURT FOR ME
TO GET OUT THERE AND BE SOCIAL.

90
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:41,786
I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE
TO BURN THE MIDNIGHT OIL

91
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,986
AFTER ALL THOSE REPORTS COME
IN AFTERWARDS ANYWAY.

92
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:48,219
BESIDES, I'M STILL WAITING FOR
SOMETHING TO GO DOWN IN MINAMI.

93
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,386
[AKATSUKI] UH, M‐MY LORD?

94
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:53,119
[SHIROE] UH, AAH!
OH! HEY THERE!

95
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,619
WHAT'S THE MATTER?!
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?!

96
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,619
WELL, UM, NO.
WOULD YOU...

97
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:01,519
LIKE A RED BEAN BUN?

98
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:04,086
[SHIROE] EHH...

99
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,819
[SHIROE] AH...

100
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,619
IT'S BEAUTIFUL TODAY!

101
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,719
IT FEELS LIKE I HAVEN'T
SEEN THE SUN IN FOREVER.

102
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:13,053
[AKATSUKI] THIS IS FOR YOU.
[SHIROE] HUH? YOU SURE?

103
00:06:13,153 --> 00:06:16,953
[SHIROE] PEOPLE ARE CHARGING AN
ARM AND A LEG FOR THOSE HERE.

104
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:19,619
[AKATSUKI] I GOT THEM FOR YOU.

105
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,386
[SHIROE] THANK YOU.

106
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:24,419
[SHIROE] AH! MM!

107
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,253
[BOTH] MM!

108
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,153
[SHIROE] THAT'S GOOD!
IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME.

109
00:06:31,253 --> 00:06:32,986
HUH?

110
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,786
WH‐WHAT'S WRONG?

111
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:37,886
[AKATSUKI] YOU'VE GOT BEAN
PASTE ON YOUR FACE.

112
00:06:37,986 --> 00:06:39,753
[SHIROE] HUH? OH.
HEH, THANKS!

113
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,219
[AKATSUKI] YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
A LITTLE PALE LATELY.

114
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,519
[SHIROE] WHATEVER. I'M FINE.
[AKATSUKI] OH, REALLY?

115
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,186
[SHIROE] MM‐HMM.

116
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:51,153
[AKATSUKI] SO, MY LORD...

117
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:53,186
SO WHAT'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU ANYWAY?

118
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:56,253
WHAT? UH, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO DURING THE FESTIVAL?

119
00:06:56,353 --> 00:07:01,286
THE FESTIVAL? HONESTLY, I'M
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO HELP OUT.

120
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:04,153
AT LEAST, I THINK THAT'S
WHAT HENRIETTA SAID.

121
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:05,753
OK.

122
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,019
[AKATSUKI]
I HAVE A QUESTION.

123
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,486
[SHIROE] HMM?

124
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,419
[AKATSUKI] MY LORD, ARE
YOU A FAN OF EATING CAKE?
[SHIROE] HUH?

125
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,886
[MINORI] TA‐DA!
[AKATSUKI] GAH!
[SHIROE] WHAT'S THAT?

126
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:18,786
[MINORI] WELL, IT'S
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING ON

127
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,119
AT THE FESTIVAL TOMORROW.

128
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,686
YOU WANT TO GO EAT SOME
YUMMY CAKE WITH ME?

129
00:07:22,786 --> 00:07:24,419
[SHIROE] IT'S A
CAKE BUFFET?

130
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:28,486
WELL, I FIGURED YOU
WERE THE KIND OF GUY
WHO LIKES SWEET THINGS.

131
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:30,419
FROM THE WAY HE EATS
HIS RED BEAN BUNS,

132
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,786
I WOULD SAY YES.

133
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,853
WELL, I CERTAINLY
DON'T DISLIKE THEM!

134
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,653
[AKATSUKI]
WE SHOULD GO,
MY LORD.

135
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:38,119
AND, WELL, IF WE GO AS
A COUPLE, IT'S FREE!

136
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:41,219
[MINORI] IT'S FREE,
TOTALLY FREE. LET'S GO!

137
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,686
[AKATSUKI] AH...

138

(MINORI GASPS)

139
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:45,753
[SHIROE] WHOA, WHOA! HANG ON...

140

(SHIROE GROANING)

142
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:52,719
(HAMMERING)

143
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:57,653
[SHIROE, THINKING] WHAT A
QUANDARY. WHAT DO I DO?

144
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:00,619
OH! I KNOW!

145
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:03,553
[MINORI] HMM, MAYBE NOT THIS.

146
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,386
[ISUZU] MINORI?

147
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,653
THERE'S A PRE‐FESTIVAL DANCE
GOING ON TONIGHT. COME WITH ME.

148
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,653
UH, WHAT YOU GOT
GOING ON THERE?

149
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:13,486
HMM. I'LL BE GOING OUT
WITH SHIROE TOMORROW,

150
00:08:13,586 --> 00:08:15,653
BUT I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT TO WEAR.

151
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:18,019
YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH HIM? SERIOUSLY?

152
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,619
HE NEVER LETS HIMSELF
GO OUT ANYWHERE!

153
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,953
(NAOTSUGU SNORING)

154
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,986
MAYBE HE COMES OUT FROM
BEHIND THAT DESK OF HIS

155
00:08:26,086 --> 00:08:28,353
AND LETS HIMSELF HAVE SOME
FRESH AIR ONCE A WEEK.

156
00:08:28,453 --> 00:08:29,719
SO WHERE ARE YOU
GUYS GONNA GO?

157
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:30,986
WE'RE GOING TO
A CAKE BUFFET.

158
00:08:31,086 --> 00:08:33,253
WAIT! YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

159
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:34,786
DOES HE EVEN
LIKE CAKE?

160
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,986
[MINORI] I THINK SO. IT SAYS
IF YOU WIN THIS CONTEST,

161
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:39,253
YOU GET 2 TICKETS TO
THE TWILIGHT BANQUET

162
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,586
WITH PRINCESS RAYNESHIA ON
THE SECOND DAY OF THEIR EVENT.

163
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,053
[ISUZU] WHAT? REALLY?

164
00:08:44,153 --> 00:08:46,753
[MINORI] YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST SHIROE.

165
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,886
THEY SAY THEY CAN'T TELL
WHAT HE'S REALLY THINKING.

166
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,653
THEY ALWAYS FEEL LIKE
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

167
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:53,553
BUT HE'S A
REALLY NICE GUY.

168
00:08:53,653 --> 00:08:55,786
AND IT BUGS ME WHEN
THEY SAY THAT ABOUT HIM.

169
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,753
AND I WANT TO SHOW
THEM HE'S A LOT MORE

170
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,519
THAN JUST A VILLAIN
BEHIND GLASSES.

171
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,753
(ISUZU CHUCKLES)

172
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,386
OH! THIS IS
JUST TOO GOOD!

173
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,886
[ISUZU] YOU'VE GOT
TO LET ME HELP!

174
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,253
I SHALL BE YOUR
FASHION COORDINATOR!

175
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,286
OH, THAT'S SO
NICE OF YOU.

176
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,819
THANKS, ISUZU!

177
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,053
(AKATSUKI GROANS)

178
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,619
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHY DOES MINORI HAVE TO PUT

179
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,886
SO MUCH STINKING
PRESSURE ON ME?

180
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:20,953
SHE'S JUST A MIDDLE‐SCHOOLER,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

181
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,653
UGH. HE TREATS ME LIKE
A MIDDLE‐SCHOOLER SOMETIMES.

182
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,219
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

183
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,153
BUT IS IT MY LORD'S FAULT FOR
TREATING ME LIKE A KID? IS IT?

184
00:09:31,253 --> 00:09:32,653
WELL...

185
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:35,519
I COULDN'T DO
THIS WITHOUT YOU.

186
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,353
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
MY LORD NEVER JUDGED ME
BASED ON MY APPEARANCE

187
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,786
OR EXPERIENCE LEVEL.

188
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:43,619
HE JUST ACCEPTED ME.

189
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:47,819
HE ACCEPTED ME FOR
EXACTLY WHO I AM.

190
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,286
MY LORD SAID THAT
HE'D ATTEND THE BUFFET

191
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:51,653
WITH BOTH MINORI AND ME.

192
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:54,653
BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR JUST COUPLES ONLY.

193
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,953
SO WE SHOULD END UP
ALONE AT SOME POINT.

194
00:09:58,053 --> 00:09:59,286
(GASPS)

195
00:09:59,386 --> 00:10:00,753
WAIT A SECOND. IS THIS...

196
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,719
IS THIS A DATE?! AAH!

197
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,686
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

198
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:07,653
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
WHAT EVER SHOULD I WEAR?!

199
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:08,886
(CLATTER)

200
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,753
[NYANTA] WHO'S BRINGING
ALL THAT RUCKUS?

201
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,986
[NAOTSUGU] WHO KNOWS?
IT'S AKATSUKI. SHE'S CRAZY.

202
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:15,653
[AKATSUKI] I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO CUTE CLOTHES‐‐

203
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:18,519
NOTHING SOFT, NOTHING PRETTY.

204
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,953
I NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP.

205
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,986
[HENRIETTA] OH!
[MARIELLE] ARE YOU OK?

206
00:10:22,086 --> 00:10:24,619
[HENRIETTA] OH, MY GOD.
I JUST FELT A DISTURBANCE!

207
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:27,153
MY LOVELY AKATSUKI
NEEDS MY ASSISTANCE!

208
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,619
(AKATSUKI SHUDDERS)
[HENRIETTA]
AKATSUKI, I'M COMING!

209
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,686
[AKATSUKI] I SHOULD
PICK SOMETHING MYSELF.

210
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:33,219
[KARASHIN] NO, NO, NO.

211
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,019
THAT'S GONNA BE WAY
TOO EXPENSIVE.

212
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,886
NO, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT.

213
00:10:37,986 --> 00:10:40,453
THE COUNCIL DOESN'T REALLY
LIKE TO PLAY FAVORITES.

214
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,486
YOUR LOCATION IS
DETERMINED BY LOTTERY.

215
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,053
AND THAT'S NOT
GOING TO CHANGE.

216
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:47,653
SO, UH, YOU'RE DOING
ALL THIS BY YOURSELF?

217
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,086
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

218
00:10:49,186 --> 00:10:51,686
THIS WHOLE THING'S LIKE
A GIANT BUSINESS CONVENTION.

219
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:53,653
WHAT IS ALL
THIS STUFF?

220
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,953
I ASKED FOR EVERYONE
WHO'S INTERESTED TO
SUBMIT THEIR PROPOSALS.

221
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,019
I WANT TO CHECK FOR
ANY DANGEROUS ITEMS.

222
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:01,353
HMM, MAN. THAT IS
A LOT OF CRAP.

223
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,186
[KARASHIN]
I KNOW, RIGHT?

224
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,686
PLUS, A BUNCH OF MERCHANTS
FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND ARE COMING AS WELL.

225
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:08,253
[MICHITAKA] REALLY?
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

226
00:11:08,353 --> 00:11:10,519
THIS LITTLE FESTIVAL OF OURS
HAS GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT BIGGER

227
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:11,886
THAN WE EVER THOUGHT, HUH?

228
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,586
[KARASHIN] THE NEXT FEW
DAYS ARE GONNA BE NUTS.

229
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,719
WELL, LOOKIE HERE.

230
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,219
[MICHITAKA] HMM?

231
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,253
(MICHITAKA GASPS)

232
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:18,786
DON'T DO THAT!

233
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,753
[AKATSUKI] I NEED YOUR HELP.
[MICHITAKA] WELL, THAT'S RARE.

234
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:21,986
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

235
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:24,053
[KARASHIN] IS SOMETHING
WRONG, AKATSUKI?

236
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,286
[AKATSUKI] I NEED
SOMETHING...

237
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,286
I MUST ACQUIRE FASHION!

238
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:31,119
[BOTH] HUH?

239
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,522
(CROWD CHATTER)

240
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:50,422
ALL RIGHT.
SHIROE OF LOG HORIZON.

241
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,556
[KANAKO] AND, WAIT...
TWO OTHERS?

242
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:54,556
[MINORI] THAT'S RIGHT.
[AKATSUKI] MM‐HMM.

243
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:56,856
[SHIROE] I'M TERRIBLY SORRY
TO PUT YOU OUT LIKE THIS.

244
00:11:56,956 --> 00:11:58,622
[KANAKO] OH, RIGHT.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

245
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:01,556
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL.

246
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,889
BUT BEST OF
LUCK TO YOU!

247
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,556
[SHIROE] HUH?

248
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:07,956
[SHIROE, THINKING]
WHAT DID SHE MEAN BY THAT?

249
00:12:08,056 --> 00:12:09,389
HUH?

250
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:12,389
IT REALLY IS ALL
COUPLES HERE TODAY.

251
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:15,489
MM! I CAN'T WAIT TO START.

252
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,689
[SHIROE, THINKING] WELL, I'M
DEFINITELY GLAD THEY LET ALL
THREE OF US DO THIS.

253
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,689
[AKATSUKI AND MINORI]
REALLY? ALL THREE OF US?

254
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,989
[SHIROE] YES. I JUST GOT THE OK
FROM THE EVENT ORGANIZER.

255
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,222
SO WE SHOULD BE FINE.

256
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:29,556
BUT WE'LL NEED TO EAT 12
BETWEEN THE THREE OF US, OK?

257
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:31,289
I KNOW WE CAN DO IT!

258
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,922
(MINORI AND AKATSUKI
MOAN WEAKLY)

259
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:36,189
[MINORI] SURE THING! WE'LL WIN
AS A TEAM AND GO TO THE FINALS,

260
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:37,789
RIGHT, AKATSUKI?

261
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,756
YEAH.

262
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:45,089
[SHIROE, THINKING] TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE
EATEN HERE TWICE ANYWAY.

263
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:48,456
BUT I'M HAVING THE STRANGEST
FEELING RIGHT NOW.

264
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,422
WHAT IS THIS...
PRESSURE?

265
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,722
YOU KNOW WHAT?

266
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:54,522
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT.

267
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,889
[AKATSUKI] U‐UH!

268
00:12:55,989 --> 00:12:58,722
[SHIROE] THAT'S A REALLY
NICE KIMONO. WHAT'S UP?

269
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,822
[AKATSUKI] WELL, I, UH...

270
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:04,522
I HAD A GUILD CALLED KIMONO
KOMACHI MAKE IT FOR ME.

271
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:06,856
DOES... DOES IT LOOK OK?

272
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:10,722
[SHIROE] WELL‐
[AKATSUKI] IT'S NOT FOR
GRADUATION! IT'S FASHION!

273
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:14,322
[SHIROE] OH. IT'S A‐A GRACEFUL
AND REALLY LOVELY OUTFIT, YEAH!

274
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,589
[AKATSUKI]
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

275
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:18,289
[MINORI] YEAH! IT'S
REALLY CUTE ON YOU.

276
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:19,489

279
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:23,356
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO SAY THAT.

280
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:26,189

FOR SOME NEW CLOTHES.

281
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:27,456

US SOMETIME.

[AKATSUKI] OH. MM‐HMM.

287
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,556
ISUZU KNOWS A TON
ABOUT CLOTHES.

288
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:40,156
SHE SHOWED ME A
LOT WHEN WE WENT.

THAT LOOKS SO GOOD!

REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS!

THOSE CAKES ARE GORGEOUS!

293
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:53,389
[SHIROE] HERE WE GO! WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO EAT 4 OF THOSE
CAKES APIECE, ALL RIGHT?

294
00:13:53,489 --> 00:13:55,989
OK, GUYS, ENJOY!

295
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:59,589
[SHIROE] HUH? WHAT?

296
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:01,022
[KANAKO] DIG IN!

297
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:04,589
[SHIROE] WAIT! ARE YOU CRAZY?!
THOSE CAKES ARE HUGE!

298
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,189
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PRESENT
FOR YOU FROM MY GUILD.

[SHIROE]
THANK YOU SO MUCH...

300
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:15,022
[SHIROE] OK...

301
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,856
[SHIROE] MIGHT AS WELL
START AT THE BEGINNING.

302
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:20,922
[MINORI] LET'S DO THIS!
[AKATSUKI] LET'S DIG IN.

303
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,222
[ALL] MM!

304
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:27,589
IT'S GREAT!

305
00:14:27,689 --> 00:14:29,356
[AKATSUKI] YEAH, MY LORD.
DO YOU REALLY LIKE IT?

306

[SHIROE] WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?!

307
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:32,422
I'M SERVING YOU,
MY LORD.

308
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,722
OK, BUT NOT A WHOLE
FREAKING CAKE!

309
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,722
[MINORI] OH, LET ME GO AHEAD
AND CUT IT UP FOR YOU.

310
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,889
[SHIROE] THAT ISN'T GONNA
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

311
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:42,156
[MALE] THAT'S NOT FAIR.
HE GOT TO BRING 2.

312
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,256
[FEMALE] UNBELIEVABLE...

313
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,756
[MALE] IS HE TRYING
TO SHOW OFF?

314
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,589
[SHIROE, THINKING] OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT HOW THIS LOOKS?

315
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:50,589
THERE'S NO NEED TO GET THE
GIRLS TOO INVOLVED IN THIS.

316
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,589
I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T
GET UPSET RIGHT NOW.

317
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,789
BUT I SHOULD MINIMIZE
THE DAMAGE AND RETREAT.

320
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:02,289
[SHIROE] UH! YOU REALLY
WANT ME TO KEEP EATING?

321
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:05,456

TRY THIS ONE, TOO!

328
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,056
[SHIROE] UH...

00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,856
[MINORI] IS IT GOOD?
(AKATSUKI GROANS SOFTLY)

330
00:15:24,956 --> 00:15:26,922

IT'S GOOD, BUT...

331
00:15:27,022 --> 00:15:28,922
[SHIROE, THINKING]
I SWEAR I'D RATHER FIGHT

332
00:15:29,022 --> 00:15:33,089
A DOZEN RAID BOSSES AT ONCE
AND RISK DYING A DOZEN TIMES.

333

334
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,356
THERE'S STILL
MORE. AHH!

[MINORI]
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

343
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,789
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D HAVE
TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

344

[SHIROE] WE COULDN'T
EAT THEM ALL,

345
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:00,556
SO I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT
OF CHOICE ABOUT THAT.

346
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:03,289
ARE YOU GOING HOME
TO REST, MY LORD?

347
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:04,489
[SHIROE] I WAS GOING
TO LOOK AROUND A BIT,

348
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,122
BUT THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

349

(SHIROE GROANING)

350
00:16:08,822 --> 00:16:12,422
[MINORI] UM, YOU TWO
GO ON WITHOUT ME.

351
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:14,722
I NEED TO MAKE A STOP
BEFORE GOING BACK.

352
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:16,889
[ROBOT] I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT.

TWILIGHT BANQUET,

356
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:27,689
BUT SHIROE WENT AND
ATE ALL THAT CAKE.

357
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,556
I'VE GOT TO THANK
HIM SOMEHOW.

00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:54,456
[SOUJIRO] A CAKE BUFFET?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

365
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,322
[SHIROE, VOICE‐CHAT]
OH, YEAH. AND IT'S REALLY
AWESOME. YOU SHOULD GO.

BEING LIKE THIS AT ALL.

390

SAY THAT.

MATTER TO ME.

404
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,589
[SHIROE] I GUESS.

405
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:43,189
[SHIROE] LET ME ASK YOU,
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THE CAKE.

406
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,589
[AKATSUKI] HM?
[SHIROE] IT SEEMS LIKE I
WAS DOING ALL THE EATING.

407
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:48,422
I DON'T THINK EITHER
OF YOU HAD ANY OF IT.

I GUESS I...

409
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:53,489

411

TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH YOU, MY LORD.

[SHIROE] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, YOU KNOW?

413
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:03,055
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GIVE ME
A LOT TO WORK WITH, AKATSUKI.

I HAVE ALL SORTS OF
THINGS TO DISCUSS.

416
00:19:07,422 --> 00:19:10,522
[SHIROE] OK, PICK A SUBJECT
FOR US AND LET'S TALK.

SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED IT.

419

[SHIROE] UM, I DIDN'T MEAN...
I'M SORRY. HEY! WAIT!

420

WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

431
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:11,422
WHY?

432
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:17,355

433
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:20,389

00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:32,322
WHAT DO I DO?

437
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,122
I LIKE HIM, TOO.

IT ISN'T FAIR!

440
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:52,122
NOT FAIR...

441
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:56,022
I CAN'T SAY THAT.
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

442
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,989
BUT STILL, IT STILL HURTS.

449
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:25,689
I THINK I'VE GOT A
CRUSH ON MASTER SHIROE.

450
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,422
OH, YEAH. I'M SURE.

451
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:29,822
[TOYA] SERIOUSLY?

452
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,422
AND YOU JUST NOW
FIGURED THAT OUT?
[MINORI] HUH?

453
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:34,455
[TOYA] THAT WAS PRETTY
OBVIOUS TO THE REST OF US.

454
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,755
[MINORI] NO WAY!

455
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,522
WELL, WHAT'S NOT TO
LIKE ABOUT HIM?

456
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:41,622
HE'S A REALLY SMART GUY, AND HE
ACTUALLY CARES ABOUT ALL OF US.

457
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:43,189
I COULD SEE YOU
LIKING HIM A LOT.

KEEP IT TO MYSELF?

ANYTHING FROM YOUR TWIN BROTHER.

PRETTY COOL, TOO, YOU KNOW?

461

[MINORI] HUH? TOYA!
YOU LIKE HIM, TOO?!

[TOYA] NO WAY!

463
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:00,155
[MINORI] THIS IS
A PROBLEM.

464
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:01,022
[TOYA] WHY?

465
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,755

YOU MEAN, WHY?

466
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,789
[TOYA] I DON'T THINK
IT'S A PROBLEM.

[MINORI] HUH?

468
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:09,789
IT'S ONLY A CRUSH, RIGHT?
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

469
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:11,822
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

470
00:22:16,822 --> 00:22:18,689
[MINORI]
I'M NOT SO SURE.

471
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:21,455
[TOYA] IT WON'T HURT
FOREVER. I PROMISE.

472
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,222
[MINORI] HMM.

473
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:28,689
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S NATURAL, RIGHT?

474
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,255
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO HURT.

475
00:22:30,355 --> 00:22:35,255
I HAVEN'T LOST ANYTHING.
I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

476
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,922
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BE ASHAMED OF, DO I?

477
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,122
[TOYA] EXACTLY.

478
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,322
[MINORI] YEAH!

479
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,822
[AKATSUKI, VOICE‐OVER]
THE GIRL SIMPLY ADMIRED HIM.

480
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,855
SHE WANTED TO
BE LIKE HIM...

481
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,355
TO FOLLOW HIM.

482
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:22,889
TO STAND BEHIND HIM.

483
00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:24,422
THAT WAS ALL.

484
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:27,889
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR
THOSE FEELINGS TO GROW DEEPER.

485
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,689

WITH SHIROE,
