1
00:00:03,013 --> 00:00:06,182
[GUY A] ANOTHER MURDER? HE'S
LIKE SOME SORT OF SERIAL KILLER!

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,350
[GUY B] WHY DOES HE EVEN DO IT?

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,851
IT'S NOT LIKE WE
REALLY DIE ANYWAY.

4
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,421
[GIRL A] I KNOW!
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO CRAZY!

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,924
SO HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAS HE KILLED?

6
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:17,260
NO IDEA HOW MANY HE'S UP TO,
BUT DURING CHRISTMAS?

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,828
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT, MAN.

8
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:20,896
WE WERE HAVING A HARD ENOUGH
TIME SELLING THINGS.

9
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:25,068
SO THEN, WHY HAVEN'T THE ROYAL
GUARDS DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

10
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,569
HMMM, I DUNNO.

11
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:29,405
[SHIROE, VOICEOVER]
THE ROYAL GUARDS

12
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,974
ARE THIS WORLD'S
PEACEKEEPING FORCE,

13
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:34,110
DATING BACK TO WHEN WE WERE
PLAYING ELDER TALES AS A GAME.

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,047
IF SOMEONE TRIES TO FIGHT OR PK
IN A NON PLAYER‐VERSUS‐PLAYER

15
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,016
ZONE, THEY APPEAR IMMEDIATELY
AND STOP THE FIGHTING.

16
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,752
EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE
PEOPLE OF THE LAND INSIDE THE

17
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:46,856
MOVEABLE ARMOR SUITS, OUTSIDE
MAGIC GIVES THEM THEIR POWER.

18
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:49,525
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE ROYAL
GUARD WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE

19
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,694
TO SUBDUE AN ADVENTURER
OF ANY CLASS,

20
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,230
NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL
THAT ADVENTURER IS,

21
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,299
NO MATTER WHAT
LEVEL THEIR ITEMS.

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,802
THIS IS HOW THEY MAINTAIN ORDER.

23
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,068
[HARUHARU] WELL, IT'S THE
NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE.

24
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,635
[YOSHISUKE]
AND WE'RE STUCK OUT HERE!

25
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,304
[COOL JET]
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

26
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:44,840
[TOSHI] NOTHING UNUSUAL SO FAR.
LET'S CHECK THE NEXT BLOCK.

27
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:45,942
[HARUHARU]
IT'S HARD TO FIND SOMETHING

28
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:47,377
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

29
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:48,744
[YOSHISUKE]
YEAH, IT'S NOT EVEN A QUEST.

30
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:51,414
[COOL JET] AW MAN!
IT IS REALLY COLD OUT HERE.

31
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:52,715
[YOSHISUKE] HEY!
[COOL JET] IT'S HIM!

32
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:54,250
[HARUHARU]
WHEN DID HE GET THERE?!

33
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,386
[TOSHI] STATUS! WE GOTTA
FIGURE OUT WHO HE IS AND QUICK!

34
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:57,553
[NERURESU] HUNNNHHH!

35
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,222
HE'S COMING PRETTY FAST!

36
00:02:59,322 --> 00:03:00,023
HE'S ON US!

37
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:01,925
(LAUGHING)

38
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,901
[MICHITAKA]
WIPED THEM ALL OUT?

39
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,870
THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEY WERE
ALL EXPERIENCED PLAYERS.

40
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:17,507
HE SLICED HIS WAY THROUGH
THEM LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

41
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:18,808
[SOJIRO]
THIS GUY'S FORCED THE RE‐SPAWN

42
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,643
OF AT LEAST TEN ADVENTURERS.

43
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:22,845
[MARIELLE] WE LEARNED HIS NAME
IS ENBART NERURESU.

44
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,548
HE'S NOT IN A GUILD.
IT SAYS HE'S A SAMURAI,

45
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:27,583
AND HE'S A LEVEL 94.

46
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,785
THAT'S ALL THE INFORMATION
WE COULD DIG UP ON HIM.

47
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,922
[WOODSTOCK] OKAY THEN,
WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND,

48
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:34,724
NOT IF WE ALREADY KNOW
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE GUY.

49
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:37,427
HMM... SO THEN THIS
KNUCKLEHEAD IS RUNNING AROUND

50
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,661
KILLING ADVENTURERS FOR KICKS,

51
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:40,696
BIG DEAL,
WE DON'T DIE.

52
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:42,165
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED,

53
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,200
BUT WE CAN'T JUST LET
HIM KEEP DOING THIS.

54
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,203
IT'S TRUE. OUR VERY
WAY OF LIFE IS IN DANGER,

55
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,672
THE PEACE WE HAVE ENJOYED
IS CRUMBLING AWAY.

56
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,975
AND SO, I BELIEVE
WE SHOULD CONSIDER

57
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:53,743
AN EVACUATION OF THE CITY.

58
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,046
[MICHITAKA] YOU WANT US
TO ABANDON AKIHABARA?!

59
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,114
[EINS] WE NEED TO TAKE
EMERGENCY MEASURES!

60
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:00,283
FOR INSTANCE,
WE COULD MOVE TO SHIBUYA.

61
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:01,884
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MUCH!

62
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:04,254
AND BESIDES, WE SHOULDN'T BE
MAKING A DECISION LIKE THAT

63
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:06,990
FOR EVERYONE ELSE
LIVING IN THE CITY.

64
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,690
HMMM....

65
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,292
[MARIELLE]
MAYBE NOT,

66
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:11,661
BUT SHOULDN'T WE START GATHERING
UP ALL THE LOWER LEVEL KIDS

67
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,129
AND GETTING THEM OUT OF HERE?

68
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,698
NOW THAT MIGHT BE AN
IDEA WORTH LOOKING AT.

69
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,200
THIS IS CRAZY,

70
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,469
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS IS EVEN HAPPENING...

71
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:20,670
[MICHITAKA]
WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY

72
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,638
TO SHUT THIS GUY DOWN FOR GOOD.

73
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:24,174
THAT'S FOR SURE.

74
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,543
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S THE VILLAIN
IN GLASSES UP TO, RIGHT NOW?

75
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:31,114
THE FOUNDER OF THE ROUND TABLE
SHOULD BE HERE, SHOULDN'T HE?

76
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:34,284
UH, WELL IT'S...
KINDA LIKE THIS.

77
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,120
I'VE HEARD HE'S BEEN BUSY
TRYING TO RAISE MONEY.

78
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,056
PLUS, WE ALL KNOW DECEMBER IS A
HECTIC MONTH WITH THE HOLIDAYS!

79
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:43,193
AND WE HAVE BIG PLANS
FOR TOMORROW'S EVENT!

80
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,262
WHY ZANTLEAF?

81
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,497
WELL, MY MAN.

82
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:48,999
THERE'S A REQUEST
FOR ANYONE OUT THERE

83
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,734
UNDER LEVEL FIFTY TO FINISH
HUNTING DOWN THE GOBLINS.

84
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,037
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO KEEP
LEVELING YOURSELF UP.

85
00:04:54,137 --> 00:04:56,339
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE AN EXCUSE
TO GET US OUT OF THE CITY

86
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,607
WHILE THEY HUNT DOWN THE KILLER.

87
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,675
[NYANTA] WELL, YES,
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

88
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
A NICE SIDE EFFECT, MYAH.

89
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:05,181
OH COME ON! I WANNA PIECE OF
THE ACTION TOO! WE CAN FIGHT!

90
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:06,449
TOYA!

91
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:08,784
SO, YOU WANT TO BE THE ONE
TO SLAY THE SERIAL KILLER?

92
00:05:08,884 --> 00:05:10,220
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT, CHIEF!

93
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,822
JUST ONE MISTAKE
CAN GET YOU KILLED.

94
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,357
SURE, I KNOW THAT CAN HAPPEN.

95
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:18,561
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO COME BACK TO LIFE?

96
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:22,432
NO, I GUESS, I DIDN'T
MEAN IT THAT WAY.

97
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:24,200
YEAH, LITTLE MAN.

98
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,701
WHAT I MEANT...

99
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,503
[NYANTA] IF YOU'RE A
FIGHTER ON THE FRONT LINE,

100
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:29,905
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
SO EAGER TO DIE, MYAH.

101
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,708
I... OH. I GET IT.

102
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:35,211
I'D ONLY END UP BREAKING
THE FORMATION, WOULDN'T I?

103
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:36,612
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

104
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,714
[NYANTA] YES, BUT THAT'S
NOT THE ONLY REASON.

105
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:40,850
RESURRECTION IS QUITE A GIFT.

106
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:42,652
IT'S A SPECIAL TREATMENT
GIVEN TO US

107
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:44,720
JUST BECAUSE
WE PLAYED A VIDEO GAME.

108
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,356
IF WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED

109
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:49,459
AND GET ACCUSTOMED TO
BEING ABLE TO CHEAT DEATH.

110
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,027
WE MIGHT END UP
LOSING SOMETHING

111
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:53,296
MORE PRECIOUS TO US
IN THE PROCESS,

112
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,931
Y'KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

113
00:05:58,868 --> 00:06:00,736
[MINORI, THINKING]
MISS AKATSUKI NEVER MADE IT

114
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:02,338
BACK TO THE HOUSE TODAY.

115
00:06:03,974 --> 00:06:05,241
[DISTANT VOICE]
IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE!

116
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,642
WHY DON'T WE GO OUT TO EAT?
MY TREAT, GUYS.

117
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,678
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
WHERE ARE YOU...

118
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,480
WHERE ARE YOU...?

119
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,848
[DISTANT VOICE] THIS WHOLE
SERIAL KILLER THING IS CRAZY!

120
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:14,150
[DISTANT VOICE] I KNOW.
(DISTANT GIGGLING)

121
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,419
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE.

122
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,089
I JUST WISH I COULD GET FOCUSED.

123
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,226
WOULD MY LORD BE ANGRY

124
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:26,362
IF HE KNEW I WAS UP TO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

125
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,432
[SHIROE]
KEEP HER SAFE, AKATSUKI.

126
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,835
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] WHAT DOES
HE WANT ME TO PROTECT HER FROM?

127
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:37,207
I KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND ARE WEAKER THAN WE ARE...

128
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:40,443
BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF
HER AS BEING PRETTY STRONG.

129
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:43,179
I MEAN, MORE THAN MOST.

130
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,681
DO I HAVE ANY NEED
TO PROTECT HER?

131
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,584
AM I EVEN THAT MUCH
STRONGER THAN SHE IS?

132
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:51,354
DO I HAVE RIGHT TO ASK THAT?

133
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:58,428
I MUST GET STRONGER.

134
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:02,498
[SOJIRO] OUR ENEMY IS
EXTREMELY TOUGH, EVERYONE.

135
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:05,835
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
YOU'VE BEEN IN A RAID BEFORE,

136
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:08,238
WE CAN'T LET HIM
CATCH US OFF‐GUARD.

137
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:09,872
YOU MUST CONSIDER THIS ADVERSARY

138
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:12,142
TO BE STRONGER THAN
ANYONE YOU'VE EVER FACED.

139
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:15,145
DON'T GO ANYWHERE ALONE,
AND STAY IN CONTACT.

140
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:18,514
COMMUNICATION IS KEY.
YOU'RE UP NAZNA...

141
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:20,116
DON'T PLAY THE HERO OUT THERE.

142
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:22,953
BE SURE TO USE FORMATION ALPHA
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF

143
00:07:23,053 --> 00:07:25,555
IN A FIGHT WITH THE
SUBJECT, OKAY GUYS?

144
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,957
NOW THERE'S ONE OTHER THING,

145
00:07:27,057 --> 00:07:29,825
EACH TEAM WILL HAVE TWO
HEALERS FOR RECUPERATION.

146
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:31,394
REMEMBER ITS CONNAISSANCE...

147
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:35,765
BUY TIME, KEEP US POSTED,
AND DON'T GET YOURSELF KILLED.

148
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:36,599
GOT IT?

149
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:37,934
[ALL]
ROGER!

150
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,570
ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO ADD?

151
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,438
[SOJIRO] (SIGH)
WELL, YOU KNOW.

152
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,409
I THINK YOU'VE SAID EVERYTHING
I WANTED TO SAY ALREADY.

153
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,445
WELL, THERE IS ONE THING...

154
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:53,316
THIS BASTARD PKED
A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY!

155
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:56,019
TAKE HIM OUT.

156
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:13,669
OHH... THIS IS GREAT!

157
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:14,870
THIS IS SO AWESOME!

158
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:15,871
YEAH!

159
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:17,907
(CHATTER)

160
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,177
COME ON, NAZNA!

161
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:23,413
DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD BE OKAY
TO GO OUT ON PATROL BY NOW?

162
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,482
I WANT THE FIRST SHOT
AT REVENGE ON THIS GUY!

163
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:29,052
EAH, WELL, YOU JUST TOOK
ANOTHER TRIP TO THE CATHEDRAL;

164
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:30,686
YOU'RE STILL GONNA NEED
A COUPLE DAYS.

165
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:32,788
IT'S JUST TOUGH SEEING
MASTER SOJIRO AND EVERYONE

166
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,224
DEFENDING ME LIKE THIS.

167
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:36,692
IT'S NOTHING YOU SHOULD
TAKE PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW?

168
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,562
IF ANYONE IN OUR GUILD
GETS PKED,

169
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:42,098
SOJI WILL MAKE SURE HE PAYS.

170
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:44,734
(SLURPING) 'CAUSE
THAT'S THE WAY HE IS.

171
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:46,336
YEAH, I KNOW HE IS.

172
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:50,540
MASTER SOJIRO DOES WHAT HE CAN
TO KEEP US FROM GETTING HURT.

173
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,008
(SIPS)

174
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:55,078
BUT STILL, I CAN DREAM OF
TAKING MY REVENGE, CAN'T I?

175
00:08:55,178 --> 00:08:57,413
[NAZNA] (GIGGLE)
NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE!

176
00:08:57,513 --> 00:09:00,516
WHOEVER HEARD OF PORK MISO SOUP
ON CHRISTMAS EVE?

177
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:03,119
[KYOKO] YEAH! AND THIS ONE
HAS SALMON IN IT!

178
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:07,690
[NAZNA, THINKING] MASTER SOJIRO
IS KIND TO US, IT'S TRUE.

179
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,992
BUT I GET THE FEELING,

180
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:11,061
IT'S NOT BECAUSE HE HAS
SOME HEART OF GOLD,

181
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,429
IT'S JUST HIS NATURE...

182
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,167
HE LOOKS CALM, BUT I KNOW
HE'S LOST HIS PATIENCE.

183
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,569
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT HE'LL
DO NEXT.

184
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:23,106
WHAT'S THE OLD SAYING, "NEVER
MISTAKE KINDNESS FOR WEAKNESS?"

185
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:25,141
(PING)
[SOJIRO] UH? OH!

186
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:28,144
[NAZNA, THINKING] IF ONLY
KAZUHIKO AND SHIROE WERE HERE.

187
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:31,181
THEY'RE THE ONLY TWO
THAT CAN MAKE SOJIRO

188
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:34,985
CHANGE HIS MIND
WHEN HE'S THIS DETERMINED.

189
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:36,920
[NAOTSUGU]
I KNOW, I'M REALLY SORRY!

190
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,758
YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE A BETTER
DAY, LET'S SHOOT FOR NEW YEARS.

191
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:44,260
REALLY?

192
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,496
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND THE SERIAL KILLER YET?

193
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,364
I TAKE IT YOU'VE BEEN
DOING ROUNDS.

194
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:52,502
YEAH, UH, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT US.

195
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:57,107
[SOJIRO, VOICEOVER] AND WELL!
AKATSUKI'S BEEN WORKING HARD.

196
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,209
(HEAVY BREATHING)
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

197
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:04,080
OF COURSE, AND YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, SHIROE!

198
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:05,815
SOJI!

199
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,619
HMPH... WE FINALLY SPOTTED HIM.

200
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,554
(CRYING OUT)

201
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,623
[NAZNA] I TOLD THE INVESTIGATION
TEAM TO GET OUT OF THERE.

202
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:17,293
LET'S FIND HIM, SURROUND HIM,
AND KILL HIM!

203
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:23,299
[KINJO] I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN
SOME TIME, PRINCESS RAYNESHIA.

204
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:27,770
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING] THIS IS
LORD KINJO OF THE KUNIE TRIBE,

205
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,941
I WONDER WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
WITHOUT EVEN CALLING ON ME.

206
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,276
[KINJO]
IT APPEARS I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

207
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,612
FIRST BECAUSE I GAVE YOU NO
PRIOR NOTICE OF THIS VISIT.

208
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:39,682
HOWEVER THE SECOND INVOLVES
A MATTER OF SOME GRAVITY

209
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:41,384
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND.

210
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,654
YOU'RE FORGIVEN FOR THE FIRST,
WHAT'S THE SECOND?

211
00:10:44,754 --> 00:10:48,158
I TAKE IT YOU'RE FAMILIAR
WITH THE MOVABLE ARMOR?

212
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:50,193
ADVENTURERS KNOW THEM
DIFFERENTLY,

213
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:53,496
THEY TEND TO REFER TO THEM
COLLECTIVELY AS THE ROYAL GUARD.

214
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:56,299
YES, NATURALLY,
I'M AWARE OF THEIR ROLE

215
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,834
IN KEEPING THE PEACE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

216
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:01,171
A SET OF MOVABLE ARMOR

217
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,974
HAS BEEN STOLEN FROM
THE PALATIAL GUARDROOM.

218
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:05,441
WHAT?

219
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,444
[KINJO] A MEMBER OF THE
ROYAL GUARD HAS TAKEN IT.

220
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:12,382
I ALSO BELIEVE HE HAPPENS TO
BE A MEMBER OF THE KUNIE TRIBE.

221
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:15,751
(GASP)

222
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:26,696
[KINJO] A GIANT MAGIC CIRCLE
UNDER THE CITY

223
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:29,966
CONSTANTLY SUPPLIES A GUARD'S
MOVABLE ARMOR WITH POWER.

224
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,602
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAGIC
CIRCLE VARIES WITH EACH CITY.

225
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:35,705
GEOGRAPHY AND THE PLACEMENT
OF BUILDING ALL ARE FACTORS.

226
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,740
SO IF I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME,

227
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,709
HE WON'T BE ABLE TO
LEAVE THE CITY WITH IT.

228
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,012
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
ON THE OTHER HAND,

229
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:44,014
HE'S NEARLY INVINCIBLE
WITHIN THE CITY.

230
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:45,581
AND THE AMOUNT OF MAGIC
HE CAN DRAW

231
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:48,318
MAKES HIM FAR STRONGER
THAN ANY ADVENTURER.

232
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:49,920
(GASP)

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,322
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING EXACTLY?

234
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,457
I AM SAYING THAT MY TRIBE...

235
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,826
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THE MURDERS.

236
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:00,931
IT SHAMES ME, BUT I CANNOT
DENY THE POSSIBILITY.

237
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,498
[RAYNESHIA, THINKING]
IN OTHER WORDS,

238
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:06,436
A PERSON OF THE LAND
IS KILLING ADVENTURERS.

239
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:09,372
OUR NEGLIGENCE ALLOWED THIS
TO HAPPEN, YOUR MAJESTY.

240
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,907
YOU HAVE MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES.

241
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:13,909
(EXHALE)

242
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,546
WELL THEN,

243
00:12:16,646 --> 00:12:20,283
CAN THE KUNIE TRIBE DEVISE A
METHOD OF FIXING THIS?

244
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:23,153
FIND A WAY OF MAKING THIS RIGHT?

245
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:26,556
FOR THAT I APOLOGIZE AS WELL.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN.

246
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,659
HOWEVER, WE CAN DEPRIVE
THE ARMOR OF ITS POWER

247
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,828
BY SHUTTING OFF THE MAGIC
TO THE CITY'S CIRCLE.

248
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:34,297
OF COURSE, THIS WOULD ALSO

249
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:36,632
NEUTRALIZE THE CITY'S
OTHER MAGICAL DEFENSES.

250
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,236
THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STOPPING
MONSTERS FROM COMING IN.

251
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:42,105
WELL, IF YOU
WERE TO TRY THIS,

252
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:44,140
COULDN'T YOU JUST
RESTORE THE CIRCLE

253
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,741
RIGHT AFTER HE'S ELIMINATED?

254
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,478
I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE, YOUR GRACE.

255
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:50,880
IT WOULD TAKE
DECADES TO RESTORE.

256
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,922
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] THIS IS ONE
TIME, I WISH I DIDN'T EAVESDROP.

257
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:02,058
BUT I HEARD ALL OF THAT.

258
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:05,761
IT DOESN'T MATTER,
WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?

259
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,567
I NEED YOU TO PROTECT THE
PRINCESS WHILE I'M GONE.

260
00:13:14,104 --> 00:13:16,206
[RAYNESHIA]
GREAT! THAT'S IT THEN!

261
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:18,108
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO ABOUT THIS!

262
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,443
WHY IN THE WORLD DID
IT HAVE TO HAPPEN NOW?!

263
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,146
AND WHY DID IT HAVE TO
BE ME OF ALL PEOPLE?

264
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:24,547
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW HOW
TO SOLVE SOMETHING

265
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:26,616
THAT'S SO BIG AND
OUT OF CONTROL!

266
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:29,685
WHY DID IT HAVE TO HAPPEN
WHILE I WAS WORKING HERE?!

267
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:32,388
I NEED SOMEONE ELSE TO
SHOW ME A WAY OUT OF THIS!

268
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:35,325
PLEASE JUST SOMEBODY HELP ME.

269
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,860
WHAT IN THE WORLD
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

270
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,895
WHY DON'T YOU ASK THE
ROUND TABLE FOR HELP?

271
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,598
[RAYNESHIA] SERIOUSLY,
IF I TELL THEM WHAT'S GOING ON,

272
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:44,534
IT WON'T DO ANYTHING
EXCEPT CREATE A WAR

273
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,536
WITH ALL OF THE ADVENTURERS!

274
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:49,472
POSSIBLY, BUT KEEPING
QUIET DOES NOTHING.

275
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:50,740
[RAYNESHIA] OKAY, FINE.

276
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,875
YOU REALLY THINK I SHOULD
JUST TELL THEM?

277
00:13:52,976 --> 00:13:55,378
[AKATSUKI] IT'S NOT MY PLACE
TO TELL YOU EITHER WAY.

278
00:13:55,478 --> 00:13:57,547
[RAYNESHIA] WHY ISN'T THAT
IGNORANT FOUR‐EYED MONSTER

279
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:59,149
HERE WHEN I NEED HIM MOST?!

280
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:01,784
HE WAS ALWAYS STICKING
HIS NOSE IN MY BUSINESS

281
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,553
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO.

282
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:06,957
HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE,
HE'S ON HIS WAY TO SEVENTH FALL.

283
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:10,593
[RAYNESHIA] YES, I KNOW HE IS...
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

284
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:14,064
UGH, WAS THAT OUTLOUD? UGH...

285
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:15,999
NNNGH

286
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,400
(EXHALE)

287
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,835
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, OKAY?!

288
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:20,903
AHH!

289
00:14:21,004 --> 00:14:22,905
[AKATSUKI]
HUH?

290
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:24,240
[RAYNESHIA]
UUHHH...

291
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,675
[AKATSUKI]
HUH?

292
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,710
SO... I GUESS...

293
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,680
I'M SORRY. I WENT AHEAD
AND LET MYSELF IN.

294
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,984
OKAY, YOU HEARD ALL THAT.

295
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,318
I DID.

296
00:14:37,053 --> 00:14:38,721
OF COURSE YOU DID.

297
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:42,125
(PAPER CRINKLING)

298
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:44,460
UH...

299
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,598
YOU WANT ONE?

300
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:55,505
IT'S SWEET. I LIKE IT.

301
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:57,974
(MUFFLED) UH‐HUH. SWEETS ARE
GOOD IN TIMES LIKE THIS.

302
00:14:58,074 --> 00:15:03,646
YES, I SUPPOSE THAT'S BECAUSE
THE WORLD ISN'T KIND OR SWEET.

303
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,050
UH... NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

304
00:15:08,418 --> 00:15:10,386
[AKATSUKI]
SO HE'S AN NPC?

305
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:11,854
[RAYNESHIA]
YES, HE IS.

306
00:15:11,955 --> 00:15:16,692
I AM REALLY, VERY SORRY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

307
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:18,894
OKAY THEN...

308
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:19,862
HUH?

309
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:21,264
THIS GUY THAT WE'RE AFTER,

310
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:22,966
YOU KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS?

311
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:24,234
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS,

312
00:15:24,334 --> 00:15:26,937
OR WHY HE DECIDED TO STEAL IT.

313
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,708
I HAVE A FEELING...
HE'S DOWN IN THE SEWERS.

314
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,909
HUH?

315
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,578
IF HE'S GOING TO LOSE HIS
POWERS OUTSIDE THE CITY,

316
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:38,048
THEN HE'S ONLY GOT A
FEW PLACES TO HIDE

317
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:39,815
AND THAT'S THE MOST LIKELY.

318
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,485
HE CAN'T BRING A LOT OF
ATTENTION TO HIMSELF,

319
00:15:42,585 --> 00:15:45,621
AND HE NEEDS TO BE EVERYWHERE
AND NOWHERE AT THE SAME TIME.

320
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,890
[RAYNESHIA] SO THEN WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO CATCH HIM RIGHT AWAY

321
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,059
IF WE GO AFTER HIM?!

322
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,395
NO, THE ROYAL GUARD CAN USE
TELEPORTATION MAGIC.

323
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,998
IF WE SURROUND HIM,
HE CAN DISAPPEAR.

324
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:57,400
YES, OF COURSE...

325
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:01,271
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
HER SHOULDERS ARE SO SLIM.

326
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:03,373
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD IT IS.

327
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:07,343
TO BE SO DELICATE AND
HAVE SO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY

328
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:10,013
IT'S JUST AMAZING TO ME.

329
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:13,849
[AKATSUKI]
IT'S BAD, HUH?

330
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,586
[RAYNESHIA]
YES IT REALLY IT.

331
