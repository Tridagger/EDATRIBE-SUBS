UWAH!

00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:07,662
HAAAA!

3
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:08,729
HWU‐HA!

4
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:14,403
[MARIELLE]
JUST REMEMBER THAT SWORD

5
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:15,737
CAN CAST THE BLIZZARD SPELL.

6
00:00:15,837 --> 00:00:17,973
NOT TO MENTION HIS STATS
ARE OFF THE CHART,

7
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:20,442
THANKS TO HIM WEARING
THAT ROYAL GUARD ARMOR.

8
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,111
BE CAREFUL;
HE'S LIKE AN OP HACKER!

9
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,648
SORRY TO ASK THIS, BUT HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN ON A RAID BEFORE?

10
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:28,116
THIS IS MY FIRST ONE!

11
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,918
[AKATSUKI]
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

12
00:00:30,018 --> 00:00:31,753
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU,
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND

13
00:00:31,853 --> 00:00:33,922
NEW YEAR'S EVE ON THE
FLOOR OF THE CATHEDRAL.

14
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,123
DEFINITELY!

15
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:37,726
LET'S MAKE OUR FIRST
RAID A SUCCESS!

16
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:38,760
SOUNDS GOOD!

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,995
MMPH.

18
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:15,657
[RIEZE, VOICE CHAT]
WE'VE GOT A VISUAL ON HIM!

19
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:18,594
HE'S ON CENTRAL STREET
HEADED TO OLD OGAWAMACHI.

20
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:21,530
HE'S CAUGHT UP TO C‐SQUAD AND
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE HEALER!

21
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,232
D‐SQUAD, FALL BACK ON CENTRAL
AND BACK THEM UP!

22
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,034
ALL OTHER UNITS
HOLD YOUR POSITIONS!

23
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,570
ISN'T AKATSUKI IN
C‐SQUAD WITH MARIELLE?

24
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,239
YES. I WAS HOPING
HE'D RUN INTO THEM,

25
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,310
ESPECIALLY WITH HER ACUTE
RECONNAISSANCE SKILLS.

26
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,144
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY!

27
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:37,579
KEEP YOUR FOCUS, KYOKO.

28
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,848
I'VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE
WITH THIS PIECE OF CRAP!

29
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,717
[RIEZE]
THEN LET'S TAKE HIM DOWN!

30
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,019
[KYOKO]
YOU'RE MINE, NERURESU!

31
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,729
(HEAVY BREATHS)

32
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,397
[RIEZE, VOICEOVER] YOU NEED
TO BE IN A CONSTANT STATE

33
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,898
OF EVALUATING YOUR OPPONENT.

34
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:59,835
KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO AND BE
AWARE OF WHAT YOU CANNOT DO,

35
00:02:59,935 --> 00:03:02,338
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE YOU
BY SURPRISE IN THE FIGHT.

36
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:03,905
(LAUGHTER)

37
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:07,343
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] I HAVE TO
FACE MY SHORTCOMINGS...

38
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:11,246
AND MAKE THEM WORK FOR ME!
NOW LET'S FIND A BLIND SPOT!

(BREATH)

40
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:16,518
[AKATSUKI]
MORBID STINGER SLASH!

41
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:19,120
GOOD HIT! THE POISON SHOULD
START WEARING HIM OUT!

42
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,456
[NERURESU]
HWAHHHH!

43
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,524
[AKATSUKI]
EH!

44
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,993
I'VE ALWAYS SEEN MY SHORT
STATURE AS A HINDRANCE.

45
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,628
BUT NOT ANYMORE...

46
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:28,764
NOT AT ALL.

47
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:35,136
HOW THICK IS YOUR BLOOD,
ADVENTURERS?! LET'S FIND OUT!

00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:47,148
I'M GLAD EVERYONE SHARED
SO MUCH OF THEIR THINGS WITH ME.

55
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:48,384
AKATSUKI!

56
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:50,018
I'M FINE!

57
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,888
LET'S PUT AN END TO THIS.
YOU MUST BE STOPPED.

00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:58,394
[KAWARA]
HYA!

61
00:03:58,494 --> 00:04:00,329

[MARIELLE]
YOU'RE THE BEST!

67
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,174
HMM? RUNNING WON'T HELP,
LITTLE GIRLS.

68
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:19,147
[KYOKO]
A RAID INSIDE THE CITY...

69
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,482
[RIEZE]
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE

70
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:22,083
BACK IN THE ORIGINAL GAME.

71
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,285
(GROWLING)

00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,252

(HEAVY BREATHING)

77
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,461
[KYOKO] I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THE ROYAL GUARDS

78
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,229
HAVEN'T COME AFTER HIM YET.

79
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:36,698
ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM,

80
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:37,999
IF HE'S HERE AND SUITED UP,

81
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:40,001
IT MUST ASSUME
HE'S HERE PUNISHING US.

82
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,571
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT'S
ALLOWING US FIGHT IN THE CITY.

00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:45,574

[NERURESU]
ALL RIGHT YOU LITTLE TROLLOPS.

86
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,144
ROUND TWO.

87
00:04:49,244 --> 00:04:50,312
AH!

00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,680
[AKATSUKI] EH!
(NERURESU GROANS)

89
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,715
WE'LL KEEP HIM OCCUPIED
AS LONG AS WE CAN!

90
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,983
GO TO THE NEXT AREA!

91
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,085
WE GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH
TO KEEP HIM BUSY!

92
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:59,588
GO GET READY TO SPANK
HIS NAUGHTY TUSHY GOOD!

93
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:00,589
WE'RE ON IT!

94
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:01,890
THANKS A LOT!

95
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:05,894
[RIEZE] IT LOOKS LIKE
THE BAKER WAS RIGHT.

96
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:08,163
LUGRIUS IS ALSO
BOOSTING HIS ABILITIES.

97
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:11,567
BASED ON THE FACT THAT EVERYONE
WITHIN 50 METERS IS BUFFING HIM.

98
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,801
[KYOKO]
IT WAS A SMART MOVE

99
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:14,636
GETTING EVERYONE
TO STAY INDOORS.

100
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,071
[RIEZE] WE'VE GOT TWENTY‐FOUR
PLAYERS OUT THERE

101
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:18,607
AND THEY'RE THE ONLY
ONES IN THE STREET.

102
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,141
I SPLIT THEM INTO SMALL GROUPS

103
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,978
AND SPREAD THEM OUT
AS THIN AS POSSIBLE.

104
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:25,113
AKATSUKI IS LEADING NERURESU
ALONG WITH HER.

105
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,749
RUNNING HIM THROUGH A GAUNTLET
OF EACH TEAM'S PATROL AREA,

106
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,951
WHERE THEY CAN
DEAL DAMAGE TO HIM.

107
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:32,921
A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF KITING.

108
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:35,056
AS HE KEEPS HIS FOCUS
ON AKATSUKI,

109
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:38,059
THE OTHERS CAN ATTACK HIM
WHILE SHE GETS HEALED.

110
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,863
[KYOKO] WELL OKAY. I CAN SEE
THAT YAMATO'S CAPTAIN

111
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:44,766
OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
REALLY KNOWS HER STUFF!

112
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,035
I LIKE IT.
IT'S GONNA WORK.

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,372
[RIEZE] WELL... IT WOULD UNDER
NORMAL CONDITIONS...

114
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,440
UH...

115
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,941
(SCREAM)

116
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,510
[RIEZE] REMEMBER, THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT...

117
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,814
YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SET UP A RAID
AND EXPECT TO WIN ANYMORE.

118
00:05:58,914 --> 00:06:01,683
[RIEZE] THAT SWORD IS
DANGEROUS ENOUGH.

119
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:03,719
PLUS NERURESU IS IN
ROYAL GUARD ARMOR.

120
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,921
HE CAN TRANSPORT
ANYWHERE IN THE CITY.

121
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,490
[KYOKO]
HE'S MOVED ON TO THE NEXT BLOCK!

122
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,025
[NERURESU]
THOSE DAMNED ADVENTURERS

123
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,860
ARE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE.

124
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,263
[LUGRIUS]
NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND.

125
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:17,699
WE MUST HUNT DOWN THAT
LITTLE WENCH FIRST!

126
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,067
[RIEZE]
TO COMPLICATE MATTERS,

127
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:21,837
HE HAS THE COMBAT SKILLS
OF A ROYAL GUARDSMAN!

128
00:06:23,204 --> 00:06:24,540
[RIEZE, THINKING]
THERE ARE STILL SO MANY THINGS

129
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,107
THAT CAN GO WRONG HERE.

130
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:27,108
ARE YOU OKAY?

131
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,210
[RIEZE]
MPH... SORRY ABOUT THAT.

132
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:32,414
KYOKO MAY I CONFIDE
IN YOU ABOUT SOMETHING?

133
00:06:32,514 --> 00:06:33,682
[KYOKO] HM?

134
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:35,784
[RIEZE] SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS JUST HIT ME.

135
00:06:35,884 --> 00:06:37,686
I'VE ENDANGERED MANY PEOPLE,

136
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:40,188
AND THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO FOR THEM RIGHT NOW.

137
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,658
AND THE THOUGHT OF THAT
OVERWHELMS AND TERRIFIES ME.

138
00:06:42,758 --> 00:06:44,460
[KYOKO]
MMM...

139
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,262
[RIEZE]
AND THE PRINCESS...?

140
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,863
SHE HAS BEEN FORCED
TO DEAL WITH

141
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:50,031
SUCH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES
HER ENTIRE LIFE.

142
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:51,967
I HAVE A NEW RESPECT FOR HER.

143
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:54,503
[KYOKO] YEAH, WELL EVERYONE IN
THE ROUND TABLE DEALS WITH IT!

144
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:56,104
AND THE SAME GOES FOR YOU.

145
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:56,905
HUH?

146
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:58,073
LIKE RIGHT NOW...!

147
00:06:58,173 --> 00:07:01,109
WE ALL DO WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE.

148
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:04,045
YES... LET'S FINISH THIS THEN...

149
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,415
MPH...

150
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:09,785
[RIEZE, VOICE CHAT] AFTER
D‐SQUAD HAS FINISHED HEALING

151
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,052
GET BACK TO C‐SQUAD.

152
00:07:11,152 --> 00:07:13,422
F‐SQUAD, I HAVE
AN UPDATE FOR YOU.

153
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,424
STANDBY, CHECKPOINT D.

154
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:18,994
[KINJO] ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

155
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:20,662
[RAYNESHIA]
I AM.

156
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,431
REMEMBER PRINCESS,

157
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:25,133
AKIHABARA WON'T HAVE IT'S
MAGICAL DEFENSES FOR DECADES.

158
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,536
AND WITHOUT THE ROYAL GUARD
TO KEEP THE PEACE,

159
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,838
IT COULD FALL INTO LAWLESSNESS.

160
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,273
[RAYNESHIA]
I KNOW...

161
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,040
HUH?

162
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,742
[HENRIETTA]
MM‐HM...

163
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:35,210
IT WASN'T JUST THE KUNIE.

164
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:37,279
ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE
LAND SHARE IN THE BLAME.

165
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,115
WE WERE RESPONSIBLE
FOR GUARDING THE ARMOR.

166
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:43,452
AND NOW WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE
CAN TO ASSIST THE ADVENTURERS.

167
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:47,523
WE OWE THEM DEARLY FOR OUR
FAILURES IN THIS MATTER.

168
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:51,226
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION, NOW
CALLS FOR CUTTING OFF THE MAGIC.

169
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:52,894
[KINJO]
I REMIND YOU,

170
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:55,597
YOU COULD BE MAKING
THEIR BURDENS WORSE.

171
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,134
[HENRIETTA] YOU DON'T
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

172
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:01,603
YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN
MASTER KINJO,

173
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,038
THE ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE HAS

174
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,140
ALREADY PETITIONED THE PRINCESS
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

175
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,109
[HENRIETTA] AND SINCE WE ARE
FELLOW RESIDENTS OF AKIHABARA,

176
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,447
WE'VE ALREADY PLEDGED OUR
SUPPORT IN REMEDYING THIS.

177
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,284
[KINJO]
IF YOU INSIST.

178
00:08:15,384 --> 00:08:18,253
REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE,
THERE'S NO DENYING ONE THING.

179
00:08:18,354 --> 00:08:22,591
THERE WAS A FAULT IN MY TRIBE'S
SECURITY THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED.

180
00:08:22,691 --> 00:08:24,293
IT'S BEEN HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

181
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:27,095
AND WE'VE ALWAYS DEFENDED
THE MAGIC CIRCLE FAITHFULLY,

182
00:08:27,195 --> 00:08:29,064
THAT HISTORY IS TARNISHED.

183
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,832
WE MUST ATONE FOR THAT.

184
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,569
UH? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

185
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,537
PRECISELY AS YOU SAID YOURSELF.

186
00:08:35,637 --> 00:08:38,374
WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR
POWER TO ASSIST THE ADVENTURERS

187
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,976
AS THEY LEARN TO
LIVE IN THIS LAND.

188
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:43,579
WE SHOULD TAKE A NEW STEP
FORWARD, AND NOT REJECT THEM.

189
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,614
(EXHALE)
HMM.

190
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:47,115
I BELIEVE I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY

191
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:49,184
FOR THE WAY I'VE
TESTED YOU, PRINCESS.

192
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,920
FURTHERMORE,
AND I'M SURE OF THIS,

193
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,154
I SHALL BE IN YOUR DEBT

194
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,491
REGARDING THIS INCIDENT,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

195
00:08:55,824 --> 00:08:57,793
AH.

196
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,161
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,
I GET THE FEELING

197
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:02,598
I'M GOING TO BE CLEARING
THAT DEBT WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

198
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,032
HMMM?

199
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:07,068
[KINJO]
WELL, WE SHOULD BE GOING NOW.

200
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:11,773
IS THAT...?!

201
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:13,174
AFTER YOU, LADIES.

202
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,343
AH.

203
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:16,878
LET'S GO...

204
00:09:16,978 --> 00:09:18,747
YAH!!!!
(GROANING)

205
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,282
(GROAN)

206
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:21,983
[RIEZE, VOICE CHAT]
J‐SQUAD, MOVE AWAY FROM HIM AND

207
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,352
GET TO SOMEWHERE YOU CAN HEAL!

208

209
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,422
[RIEZE]
D SQUAD, HOLD YOUR POSITION.

210
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:29,458
[RIEZE] YOU'VE GOT LESS THAN
THIRTY SECONDS. GET READY!

211
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,028
[AKATSUKI]
ARE YOU OKAY, MARIELLE?

212
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:34,563
THIS IS A PIECE OF CAKE!

213
00:09:34,663 --> 00:09:37,165
I CAN KEEP ON RUNNING
UNTIL DAWN IF I NEED TO!

214
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:38,600
EHEH...

215
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,968
[LUGRIUS]
WHY?

216
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:41,169
WHY?

(GASP)

218
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:45,240
[LUGRIUS]
WHY DID YOU BETRAY ME, SUTUYNAW?

219
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:47,876
NO! SHUT UP! I'M NOT LUGRIUS!

220
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:50,011
FALL BACK NOW!
YOU GOT IT!

221
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,113
QUIET! HOW COULD YOU
BETRAY ME LIKE THAT!

222
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:56,017
I SAVED YOUR CITY AND
THIS IS THE THANKS I GET?!

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,022
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
MIGHT NEED A HAND!

225
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,292

I REALLY NEEDED THAT.
THANKS A LOT YOU GUYS.

230
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,344

ADORABLE BY THE WAY.

[MARIELLE] TEN METERS TO
THE NEXT BLOCK, RIEZE.

239
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:48,670
[AKATSUKI, THINKING] I'M CLOSE,

240
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,173
I'M SO CLOSE TO LEARNING
SOMETHING. I CAN FEEL IT!

241
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,976

242
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,077

MARIELLE!

244
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:00,682
J‐SQUAD ISN'T GOING TO
GET THERE IN TIME!

245
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,618
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I AM WEAK.

246
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:05,287
MY SWORD IS STARVING,

247
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:07,589
LET'S GIVE IT A TASTE
OF YOUR BLOOD!

00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:08,824

249
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:10,292

[AKATSUKI] AGGGGHHHHHH!!!

252
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,598
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I MUST MOVE FASTER!

253
00:11:16,698 --> 00:11:18,767
NO! FASTER THAN THIS!

254
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:19,901
FASTER, AKATSUKI!

255
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:21,069

256
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:23,705

257
00:11:23,805 --> 00:11:25,507
WHAT THE HELL?! FWAH!

258
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:27,042
EHAAAUGHHHH!

259
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:30,546
(GASP) WHERE'D ALL THOSE
AKATSUKIS COME FROM?

260
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:33,915
[AKATSUKI]
WHAT A MINUTE...

261
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,150
DID I JUST RELEASE
THE HIDE SHADOW ABILITY

262
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,653
WHILE I WAS PUSHING
MYSELF BACK THERE?

263
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,522
MY DESIRE TO MOVE FASTER
MUST HAVE TRIGGERED IT SOMEHOW.

264
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:43,259
I MUST HAVE FORCED IT
TO MANIFEST.

265
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:48,330
I'VE GOT IT...

266
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,400
I'VE GOT MY ORAL ART.

267
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,768
IT'S MINE!

268
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,911
[RIEZE]
LOOKS LIKE SHE FINALLY GOT ONE.

269
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,281
[KYOKO]
YES! DO IT AKATSUKI!

270
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,848
[RIEZE, VOICEOVER]
AN ORAL ART ISN'T SOMETHING

271
00:12:06,948 --> 00:12:08,350
ONE CAN SIMPLY BE TAUGHT.

272
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,252
YOU HAVE TO TRAIN,
UNDERSTANDING YOUR WEAKNESSES,

273
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,622
AND FIGHTING TO OVERCOME THEM.

274
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,859
[RIEZE] GET HIM AKATSUKI!
AND STAY IN HIS BLIND SPOTS!

275
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,127
EH!

276
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,129
[AKATSUKI, THINKING]
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

277
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:25,534
I SPENT SO MUCH TIME DEPENDING
ON WHAT THE GAME WAS GIVING ME.

278
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:28,203
AND ALL I HAD TO DO
WAS REACH BEYOND THAT!

279
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:31,239
IT WAS THERE ALL ALONG
AND I DIDN'T SEE IT!

280
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,276
I SEE IT NOW.

281
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:37,746
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS
FREE MY EXPECTATIONS...

282
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:39,214
I USED TO BE JUST LIKE YOU.

283
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:40,849
HELD BACK BY MYSELF.

284
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:46,054
BUT IT'S OKAY IF I'M WEAK,
I CAN USE IT TO GET BETTER.

285
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:48,123
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
YOU MONSTER,

286
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:50,091
YOU CHOOSE TO NEVER
FACE YOUR DEMONS,

287
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,294
EMBRACING A CURSED POWER!

288
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,530
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYONE
TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF!

289
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,733
YOU MAY THINK YOU WIELD
OVERWHELMING STRENGTH.

290
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:02,671
... BUT IT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO
A WILL INSPIRED BY WEAKNESS!

291
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:03,639
AH!

292
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,206

293
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:07,042

PERCENT OF HER HEALTH LEFT!

00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:23,124
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, MARIELLE'S
RUNNING OUT OF MAGIC POINTS!

00:13:23,224 --> 00:13:25,327
SHE CAN ONLY CAST LIGHT
HEALING SPELLS ON HER!

00:13:25,427 --> 00:13:28,330
I'M SORRY AKATSUKI,
BUT I'M OUT OF POWER.

304
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,966
I DON'T HAVE ANY
MANA LEFT EITHER.

305
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,100

306
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,669

328

[TATARA] NO, NOT EXACTLY.
[AKATSUKI] OH...

329
00:14:28,256 --> 00:14:32,528
[TATARA] I REFORGED IT INTO
HAGANEMUSHI‐TATARA.

330

COULD HANDLE IT BETTER.

508
00:24:21,483 --> 00:24:24,653
THIS ISN'T THE WORLD OF
ELDER TALES ANYMORE.

509
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:26,588
THEIR TIME IS OVER.

510
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:27,856
UPON LOSING HIS BODY,

511
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:30,158
SHIROE WANDERS THROUGH
A TOWN OF MEMORIES.

512
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,194
HE ALSO SEES A FRIEND AT
THE BEACH ON THE MOON.

513
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:36,565
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
