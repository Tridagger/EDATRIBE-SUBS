1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:06,707
[WILLIAM] WHAT IS THIS? A QUEST
THAT'S NOT MEANT TO BE BEATEN?

2
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,275
(EXHALE)

3
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,311
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

4
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,181
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
WE LOST...

5
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,752
(EXHALE)

6
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,254
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
WE WERE COMPLETELY DESTROYED!

7
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,232
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME...

8
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,567
I DON'T UNDERSTAND...

9
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,537
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THREE
RAID BOSSES AT ONCE.

10
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,704
THAT WAS INSANE...

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,907
WHAT HAPPENED
BACK THERE ANYWAY?

12
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,108
[PIANISSISSIMO]
D‐DO YOU THINK...

13
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,910
THAT THAT'S ONLY
IN THIS RAID ZONE?

14
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,078
HMMM...

15
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,647
THAT'S A GOOD
QUESTION...

16
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,316
WE'RE IN REAL TROUBLE IF ALL
THE RAID ZONES ARE LIKE THIS.

17
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,653
[ENKARTANTO] WE'RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET VERY FAR, ARE WE?

18
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,354
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] I DON'T
THINK WE'D EVER BEAT

19
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,691
ANOTHER ZONE AGAIN. WE'D HAVE
TO STICK TO LOWER RAIDS.

20
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,992
(SNIFFLING)

21
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,629
WE POURED OUR LIVES INTO
LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.

22
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,131
BUT EVERYTHING, ALL
THE HOURS OF TRAINING.

23
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,069
IT ALL SEEMS LIKE IT
WAS FOR NOTHING NOW.

24
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,771
[AZAREA]
WE HAD BEEN DOING SO WELL.

25
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,338
SEEMED LIKE WE NEVER LOST,

26
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,641
MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE
WERE ACTUALLY IMPROVING.

27
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,342
[ELTON DISKA] WELL I
HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

28
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,478
BUT THE DAYS OF
EASY RAIDS ARE OVER.

29
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,680
(SNIFFLE)

30
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,681
(SIGH)

31
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:01,882
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT...

32
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:04,484
IT'S ALL A BIG WASTE OF
TIME NOW IF YOU ASK ME.

33
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,720
[PROMETHEUS] THE GAME'S GIVEN UP
ON US NOW THAT WE'RE HERE.

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,923
ELDER TALES... HAS ABANDONED US.
(WILLIAM GASPS)

35
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,026
[CLASSMATE A]
REALLY? A COMPUTER GAME?

36
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,895
[CLASSMATE B] IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
AN EXPERT AT WASTING YOUR LIFE.

37
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,763
[CLASSMATE D] SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU
COOPED UP AT HOME ALL THE TIME?

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,700
[CLASSMATE C] DO YOU DO ANYTHING
ELSE? CAN YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE?

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,034
[WILLIAM] GO TO HELL!

40
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,803
[CLASSMATE E] THAT'S WHY YOU
NEVER GET INVITED TO PARTIES.

41
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,871
[CLASSMATE F] YOU ACTUALLY
TALK TO YOUR COMPUTER? CREEPY!

42
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,339
[CLASSMATE G] WHY DON'T YOU TRY
DOING SOMETHING

43
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,741
THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE USEFUL
SOMEDAY?

44
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,510
[CLASSMATE H] WHO CARES,
JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE.

45
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,077
SOME PEOPLE WERE JUST
BORN TO BE LOSERS.

46
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,378
[WILLIAM]
SHUT UP!

47
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,848
[JUNZO] HUH?
[BOLOGNESE MASTER] HM?

48
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,417
[WILLIAM]
UH...

49
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,787
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
WHAT THE HELL DO I TELL THEM?

50
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,790
[ALT WILLIAM] "WE'LL DO IT
NEXT TIME, SO LET'S GET 'EM!"

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,993
"I'M SURE THE OTHER
RAID ZONES ARE FINE!"

52
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,095
[WILLIAM, THINKING] I CAN'T TELL
THEM SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

53
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,464
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

54
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,267
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

55
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,802
[FEDERICO] IS THIS IT? IS THIS
AS FAR AS WE GO?

56
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,804
[WILLIAM, THINKING] DOES THIS...
ARE WE...?

57
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,872
[WILLIAM]
UH...?

58
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,741
(EXHALE)

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,778
(BREATH)

60
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,549
HMM. GUESS IT'S TIME
TO GO ON BACK HOME...

61
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:11,618
AND GET BACK TO OUR JOBS OF
KEEPING THE PEACE IN SUSUKINO.

62
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,354
PROBABLY, MIGHT ACTUALLY
HAVE FUN BACK THERE.

63
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,123
EZZO HAS MORE THAN ITS
FAIR SHARE OF MONSTERS.

64
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,926
PEOPLE OF THE LAND
APPRECIATE OUR PRESENCE.

65
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,730
YEAH, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
FIND A GIRLFRIEND ANYWAY.

66
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,968
PROBABLY THE SMARTER WAY TO
LIVE THAN DOING THIS EVERYDAY.

67
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,303
MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT.

68
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,139
[WILLIAM, THINKING] BUT IF WE
DID THAT.

69
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,742
THEN WE'RE NO DIFFERENT
THAN EVERYONE ELSE!

70
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,312
WE'D BE TAKING THE EASY ROAD...
OFFERING NOTHING BUT CORDIAL

71
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,649
COMPANY AND A LITTLE SHALLOW
"VALUABLE" ADVICE.

72
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,585
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT...

73
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:46,352
[ALL] MM?

74
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,922
IN FACT YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT...

75
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,126
BUT YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I THINK ABOUT IT? IT'S BULLSHIT!

76
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,160
HUH?

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,763
HUH?
ARE YOU OKAY?

78
00:04:56,863 --> 00:05:00,634
WE JUST GOT OUR BUTTS
KICKED... WE LOST ONE.

79
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:04,204
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL JUST
QUIT, MAYBE WE'RE WASHED UP.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,406
IT COULD BE A BIG WASTE OF TIME.

81
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,441
IT'S WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS
BEEN TOLD, RIGHT?!

82
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,477
I GUESS ALL THOSE PEOPLE KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT.

83
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,880
WE'RE A BUNCH OF GAME JUNKIES
LOCKED IN OUR ROOMS,

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,582
ADDICTED TO WASTING TIME.

85
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,684
AND SO WHAT IF WE ARE, GUYS?!

86
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,521
I MEAN IT'S NOT LIKE WE
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW IT!

87
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,690
WE ALL KNEW EXACTLY WHO
WE WERE AND STILL.

88
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,828
WE KEPT LOGGING BACK IN.
WE ALL DID THE SAME THING.

89
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,030
[ALT WILLIAM] IF THEY
WANNA QUIT, SO BE IT.

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,331
BUT I WILL NOT STOP!

91
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:32,666
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN
JUST BECAUSE

92
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,536
I GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE!

93
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,337
[WILLIAM] I GET IT. WE LOST.

94
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,740
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S NEW FOR US.

95
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,042
BUT IT PROBABLY WON'T BE THE
LAST TIME!

96
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,945
THERE'S NO NEED TO START PACKING
IT IN AFTER ONE DEFEAT!

97
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:49,315
I MEAN, OUR WIN‐TO‐LOSS RATIO IS
WHAT COUNTS, RIGHT?

98
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,351
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE A LOOK ON

99
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,587
THE SERVER AND SEE
IT FOR YOURSELF.

100
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,656
YOU'RE GREAT AT THIS,

101
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,390
EVEN IF IT'S MEANT FOR KIDS!

102
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,659
[ALT WILLIAM]
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

103
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,727
IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL TO US.

104
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,730
[WILLIAM] I'M NOT SAYING GROW
UP AND GO BACK TO SUSUKINO...

105
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,766
I WON'T TELL YOU
SOMETHING LIKE THAT...

106
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,034
BECAUSE WE'RE ALL
THE SAME IN HERE.

107
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,570
LOOK WE ALL MIGHT FEEL LIKE

108
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,772
WE'RE WORTHLESS FOR
LOSING THIS QUEST...

109
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,175
BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S GOING
TO KEEP ME FROM DOING IT AGAIN!

110
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,745
[ALT WILLIAM] FOR ME... THIS
IS THE CENTER OF MY UNIVERSE.

111
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,547
[PIANISSISSIMO] UH...
[WILLIAM] ARE WE ALL JUST

112
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,383
BITS AND BYTES OF WORTHLESS
INFORMATION ON SOME SERVER NOW?

113
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,485
I DON'T THINK SO!
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE!

114
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,554
AND YOU'RE WORTH
SOMETHING. ALL OF YOU!

115
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,090
YOU MIGHT FEEL LOST
AND STUCK IN HERE...

116
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,459
BUT I'M THAT YOU'RE WITH ME!

117
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,562
THE IDIOTS OUT THERE TOLD YOU
THAT GAMES WERE WORTHLESS.

118
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:38,599
WELL I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT THEY WERE WRONG!

119
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,866
NEVER ALLOW SOMEONE WHO

120
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,968
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YOU
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO!

121
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,638
I MIGHT LOOK A LITTLE
RIDICULOUS RIGHT NOW.

122
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,940
JUST SOME SHUT‐IN
PLAYING A SILLY GAME!

123
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,776
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF IT'S
SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES ME,

124
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,878
AND DRIVES ME ‐ WHAT'S
WRONG WITH THAT?!

125
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,615
IT'S MY CHOICE! AND
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

126
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:57,450
ALL OF US DECIDED WE
WANTED TO BE HERE!

127
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,352
[ALT WILLIAM]
I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE,

128
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,588
I WON'T LET ANYONE
MAKE LIGHT OF THAT!

129
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,323
[WILLIAM] JUST LOOK
AT ALL THE TIME

130
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,925
WE'VE INVESTED IN ELDER TALES.

131
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:08,028
SERIOUSLY, IT WAS A WHOLE
HELL OF A LOT OF TIME.

132
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,164
WHEN A RAID BOSS SHOWED HIS
FACE... WE'D GRAB OUR WEAPONS

133
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,067
AND LAY A BEATING ON HIM!
WE COULDN'T BE STOPPED!

134
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,669
AND YEAH! WE GOT ALL EXCITED

135
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,638
AND SOUNDED LIKE A
BUNCH OF GIDDY KIDS!

136
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,173
SURE, MAYBE IT WAS NOTHING BUT
A BUNCH OF ONES AND ZEROES

137
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,576
ON A COMPUTER SOMEWHERE
MILES AWAY.

138
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:26,046
BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING, WE
LOVED IT. AND SOMETIMES WE WON,

139
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:30,016
AND SOMETIMES WE LOST.
BUT WE CAME BACK EITHER WAY.

140
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,286
SO WHAT IF WE'VE ACTUALLY LET
THIS GAME CONSUME US...?

141
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,622
EVERY MINUTE'S BEEN
WORTH IT, RIGHT?!

142
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,025
YES. WINNING IS THE BEST
PART. WE'D CELEBRATE,

143
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,295
SPLIT UP ALL THE EPIC ITEMS
AND TOAST OUR VICTORY.

144
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,698
AND WHEN WE LOST, WE'D
PICK OURSELVES UP,

145
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,701
HAVE AN EVALUATION MEETING AND
TRY TO FIND A BETTER WAY.

146
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,870
IF YOU WANNA SIT THERE AND
TELL ME IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

147
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,006
GO RIGHT AHEAD, LIKE I
SAID THIS IS YOUR CHOICE.

148
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,542
BUT I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S A GAME ANYMORE!

149
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,044
AND IF WE DO PUT OUR
TIME INTO THIS PLACE...

150
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,514
THEN WE MAKE IT WORTH IT!

151
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,117
(EXHALES)

152
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,786
[ALT WILLIAM]
OKAY, WE LOST.

153
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,654
AND FOR SILVER SWORD,
WINNING RAIDS

154
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,090
WAS LIKE DOING SOMETHING SACRED.

155
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,659
SO WHAT DO I DO NOW?

156
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,629
WHAT... WHAT ELSE
DO I TELL THEM?

157
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,064
WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY?

158
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,167
WHAT I MEAN, IS THAT
WE'RE NOT LIKE THEM.

159
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,504
AREN'T WE ALL THE SAME HERE!

160
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,205
IT'S JUST US, I
REALLY DON'T CARE

161
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,741
ABOUT ANYONE ELSE AT THIS POINT!

162
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:31,044
[ALT WILLIAM] HEY GET IT
TOGETHER! WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

163
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,046
[WILLIAM] UH. I JUST MEAN
I KNOW IT'S EASIER

164
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,581
TO GIVE UP AND MOVE ON!

165
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,617
AND YOU'RE ALL FREE
TO DO JUST THAT.

166
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:39,620
SO THEN WHY AM I GOING
OFF LIKE THIS ANYWAY...?

167
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,522
[ALT WILLIAM] YES, WILLIAM.
WHAT'S THE POINT HERE?

168
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,457
[WILLIAM] SO, LOOK, IT'S
LIKE THIS! I DON'T KNOW!

169
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,959
[ALT WILLIAM]
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

170
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,728
DO IT FOR YOU!

171
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,862
ANYTHING THAT HELPS YOU MAKE A
FRIEND

172
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,731
HAS GOTTEN BE WORTH SOMETHING!

173
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,100
[ALT WILLIAM] I GUESS, THIS IS
REALLY ALL I CAN TELL THEM.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,269
[WILLIAM] IT'S FINE IF
IT'S YOUR GOOD LOOKS.

175
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,338
OR IF YOU'RE CLEVER OR SMART.

176
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,006
YOU'RE THE LIFE‐OF‐THE‐PARTY,
OR MAYBE

177
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,776
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD
SENSE OF HUMOR.

178
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,645
BUT I'VE GOTTA ASK YOU THIS:

179
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,479
DID YOU REALLY HAVE ALL THOSE
THINGS IN YOUR PERSONALITY

180
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,914
WHEN WE WERE IN REAL LIFE?

181
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:12,986
I KNOW I DIDN'T. AND I ADMIT
IT! I WAS VERY AWKWARD!

182
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,022
[WILLIAM] LOOK, YOU GUYS...
[DINKURON] AH...

183
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,891
[WILLIAM] I KNOW I'VE NEVER SAID
THIS BEFORE...

184
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,526
COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO...

185
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:23,029
BUT YOU GUYS ARE
ALL MY FRIENDS.

186
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,430
[PIANISSISSIMO]
HUH?

187
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,899
[WILLIAM]
AND YOU KNOW WHAT...

188
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,802
WITHOUT THE GAME, I
WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

189
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,039
I'M JUST A NOBODY. I'M A LOSER!

190
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,578
I JUST... I JUST HID MYSELF
AWAY AND LIVED INSIDE A GAME.

191
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,145
NOT EVEN SURE WHY.

192
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,948
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED A
PLACE TO HEAL OR SOMETHING.

193
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,085
AND INSIDE THE GAME, I'D SAY
I FOUND THAT.

194
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,688
THERE'S A WAY TO FALL
BACK AND GET HELP.

195
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,690
AND A WAY TO HELP OTHERS.

196
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,492
I FOUND A GUY WHO THOUGHT HE
BELONGS ON THE FRONT LINES,

197
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,827
BUT DIDN'T HAVE TO STAY THERE.

198
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,496
INSTEAD HE LEANED ANOTHER
WAY TO BE VALUABLE.

199
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,131
HE MAY HAVE BEEN
QUIET AND RESERVED,

200
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,101
AND DIDN'T GET ALL
THE ATTENTION HE WANTED.

201
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,468
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

202
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,939
TURNED OUT HE WAS THE ONE HIS
FRIENDS COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON.

203
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:09,275
HE WAS TERRIFIED, BUT
HE DIDN'T LET IT SHOW.

204
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,411
HE'S DEAD TIRED FROM DAILY LIFE,
BUT HE MADE IT

205
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:16,883
A POINT TO LOG IN EVERY SINGLE
DAY. I SEE IT! I REALLY DO!

206
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,386
I MEAN IT. AND THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

207
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,123
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

208
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:27,327
THIS GAME HAS TAUGHT ME A
LOT ABOUT PEOPLE. AND MYSELF.

209
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:32,733
I HEARD IT ALL IN THE OUTSIDE
WORLD. "YOU JUST DON'T GET IT."

210
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,367
"YOU'RE SELF‐RIGHTEOUS."

211
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,569
"YOU'RE INCONSIDERATE."

212
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,270
"YOU'RE A LOUSY TEAM PLAYER."

213
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,805
"YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PATIENCE."

214
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,507
"YOU CAN'T TAKE A HINT."

215
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,643
"YOU DON'T BELONG ANYWHERE."

216
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,047
YOU CAN ONLY HEAR SO MUCH OF
THAT OVER AND OVER

217
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,316
BEFORE YOU JUST SHUT EVERYONE
OUT OF YOUR EXISTENCE.

218
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,386
ELDER TALES WAS DIFFERENT.

219
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,688
IT WAS A PLACE WHERE, SOMEHOW,

220
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,724
I ACTUALLY STARTED
FEELING CONNECTED.

221
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,426
I CHERISHED THOSE BONDS WITH
EVERY OUNCE OF MY BEING.

222
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:05,599
AND IN RETURN, MY NEW FRIENDS
SHARED SO MANY SECRETS WITH ME!

223
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,101
THE FIRST THING I LEARNED WAS
TEAMWORK.

224
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,170
THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE
I WORKED WELL WITH,

225
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,872
BUT OTHERS, NOT SO MUCH.

226
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:15,108
SOME PLAYERS GOT IT,
AND OTHER JUST DIDN'T.

227
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:17,878
BUT LEARNING HOW TO WORK

228
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:21,247
WITH OTHERS WAS THE
BEST REWARD OF ALL.

229
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,784
I SOON FIGURED OUT THE SOME
PARTNERSHIPS DIDN'T WORK OUT,

230
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,087
ONLY BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS AFTER.

231
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,991
AND THEN, I FINALLY
STARTED RAIDING.

232
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,127
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
I BECAME A GUILD MASTER.

233
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,730
NEXT I LEARNED THAT
OUR WIN/LOSS RATIO

234
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,600
MAGICALLY INCREASED ON
NIGHTS WE WERE ALL HYPED UP.

235
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,502
SOMETIMES ABOUT LITTLE
STUPID THINGS.

236
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:45,171
SOME PARTY MEMBERS PLAYED
FEELING GREAT, AND OTHERS LOUSY.

237
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,508
I MEAN, WE ALL HAD OUR OWN
PERSONAL PROBLEMS

238
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,142
GOING ON IN THE REAL WORLD.

239
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:53,179
I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT EVERYONE
IN MY GUILD WAS JUST LIKE ME.

240
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,281
I STARTED ASKING THEM ABOUT
THEIR LIVES AND

241
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,051
WHAT THEY WANTED FROM
ME AS THE LEADER.

242
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,722
I FINALLY LEARNED PATIENCE, AND
HOW TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

243
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,924
IT'S REALLY AN ART
FORM, YOU KNOW?

244
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,427
AND, AFTER A WHILE, EVERYONE
STARTED

245
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,329
TO PUT UP WITH MY SHORT FUSE.

246
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,600
MOST RAID GUILDS
DON'T LAST VERY LONG.

247
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,603
EVERY RAID WILL COME ACROSS
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WANTS,

248
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,605
AND NOT EVERYONE GETS TO HAVE
IT.

249
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,707
ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S
ONLY ONE ITEM.

250
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,408
PEOPLE IN YOUR
PARTY FEEL CHEATED,

251
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,744
AND THEY LET YOU KNOW ABOUT IT.

252
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:25,512
EVERYONE GETS TICKED
AT EACH OTHER

253
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,881
AND EVENTUALLY IT
ALL BREAKS APART.

254
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:33,587
BUT SOMEHOW, WE MANAGED
TO ALWAYS WORK IT OUT.

255
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,155
I TRIED TO BE COMPLETELY OPEN

256
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,023
WITH MY GUILDMATES
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

257
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,560
THEY FORGAVE ME FOR GETTING
PISSED OFF ALL THE TIME

258
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,394
AND STARTED TO TRUST ME.

259
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:44,831
AND THE WORD OF OUR GUILD GREW,
AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE

260
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,868
EVERYONE KNEW WE WERE A
FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.

261
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:52,205
EVERYONE IN ELDER TALES
KNEW THE NAME SILVER SWORD.

262
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,783
[WILLIAM] I MEAN COME ON. I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

263
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:05,952
IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO FIGURE OUT.

264
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:08,689
YOU THINK THIS IS IT,
DON'T YOU? GAME OVER!

265
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,691
ADMIT IT. YOU'D RATHER
JUST GO BACK HOME

266
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,793
AND FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED.

267
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,996
AND YEAH WELL MAYBE
THAT IS AN OPTION!

268
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,932
BUT I LIKE BEING HERE!
[ORDISSO] HUH?

269
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,569
AND I KNOW THAT AT LEAST A FEW
OF YOU ENJOY THIS TOO.

270
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,138
WE ALL ENDED UP IN THIS PLACE
BECAUSE WE LOVED THE GAME.

271
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:29,676
I MEAN. IS IT REALLY SO
BAD THAT WE'RE HERE?

272
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:32,245
THIS IS THE WORLD
OF ELDER TALES!

273
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,716
WE OBSESSED OVER IT DAY AND
NIGHT AND NOW WE'RE HERE!

274
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,319
THIS IS THE WORLD WHERE
WE ARE AT OUR BEST!

275
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,022
YOU CAN'T TELL ME THIS
ISN'T A BLESSING!

276
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,857
[DINKURON]
WILLIAM!

277
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:44,925
[ELTON DISKA]
GUILD MASTER!

278
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,159
[WILLIAM]
HUH?

279
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,628
HEY...

280
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,563
[WILLIAM, VOICEOVER] THE THING
THAT MADE ME THE HAPPIEST...

281
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,199
WAS SEEING THAT EVERYONE
ELSE WAS IN HERE WITH ME.

282
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,936
YOU GUYS... YOU'RE
JUST LIKE I IMAGINED!

283
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,904
AND I HOPE I'M THE SAME TO YOU.

284
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,973
MAYBE THAT'S BESIDES
THE POINT...

285
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:03,009
BUT I'M JUST GLAD WE
COULD DO THIS TOGETHER!

286
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:06,446
AND THERE'S NO ONE TO TELL US
WE'RE LOSERS HERE, RIGHT?

287
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,886
BUT NOW, WE WILL... WE WILL BE
A BUNCH OF LOSERS IF WE LEAVE!

288
00:14:12,986 --> 00:14:14,788
MAYBE WE CAN'T WIN!

289
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,758
MAYBE THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE

290
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,226
THE ODDS ARE
DEFINITELY AGAINST US!

291
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,729
BUT WHO CARES?

292
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,364
WHO CARES IF WE LOSE AGAIN!

293
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,133
CAN YOU LOOK YOURSELF IN THE
MIRROR IF YOU DON'T TRY?!

294
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,336
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE'LL BE DOING
IF WE JUST GO BACK, HUH?

295
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,872
WHAT'S LEFT FOR US?!

296
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:33,974
TAKE THIS AWAY, AND
WHAT DO WE HAVE LEFT?

297
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,942
I PLAYED ELDER TALES SO MUCH

298
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,544
THAT EVERYONE THOUGHT
I WAS A FREAK.

299
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:41,214
I'VE GIVEN TWO YEARS OF
MY LIFE TO THIS PLACE!

300
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:44,217
I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
ELSE WHENEVER I PLAYED IT!

301
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:48,188
WHEN I ATE, SLEPT, AND BATHED,
MY HEAD WAS IN THE GAME!

302
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,824
EVERY SINGLE THING
I DID IN LIFE!

303
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,194
EVERYTHING I DID WAS
FOR ELDER TALES!

304
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,630
[ENKARTANTO] YEAH. SAME HERE.

305
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,031
[VOINEN] MM‐HM...

306
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,567
[WILLIAM] YOU CAN CALL
ME CRAZY IF YOU WANT...

307
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,368
THAT'S FINE.
I'M USED TO THAT!

308
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,171
YEAH, I'M A GAMER DORK WHO
SPENDS HIS NIGHT WITH FRIENDS

309
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,374
HE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN TO
WIN SOME IMAGINARY PRIZES!

310
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,977
BUT I'M GOING TO DO
IT THE BEST I CAN!

311
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,846
SO I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE...

312
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,850
I'M GOING TO TURN AND RUN AWAY
FROM AN EXTRA RAID BOSS OR TWO.

313
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,085
WHERE WOULD I GO IF I
DIDN'T TAKE THIS ON?

314
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,286
WHO WOULD I BE IF
I WERE TO SCOFF AT

315
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,989
ALL THIS LIKE THE
JERKS BACK HOME?

316
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,626
SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO WALK AWAY...

317
00:15:25,726 --> 00:15:27,327
THEN YOU WILL JOIN
THE VERY PEOPLE

318
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,796
THAT LAUGHED AT US
AND PUT US DOWN.

319
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,765
AND THEN I SAY
THE HELL WITH YOU!

320
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,667
[DEMICAS]
YOU GUYS ARE A BUNCHA MORONS!

321
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,869
[ALL] HUH?

322
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,203
[DEMICAS] LISTEN TO YOU.

323
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,272
YOU JUST WANNA KEEP
ON GETTING KILLED.

324
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,309
HEY I LIKE A GOOD FIGHT, BUT
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH YOU KNOW?

325
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,245
WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?

326
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,281
I'D BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU
IF WE STOOD A CHANCE...

327
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,417
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET
CREAMED IN THERE AGAIN.

328
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,620
AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL WE'RE
DOING

329
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,722
IS PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAME!

330
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:58,324
AND THE RULES ARE
STARTING TO CHANGE.

331
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,026
FACE IT, MAN! WE'RE
ALL A BUNCH OF

332
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,062
CLUELESS AMATEURS
AGAINST THIS THING.

333
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,566
WE'RE BANGING OUR HEADS
AGAINST THE WALL. WE'RE LOST!

334
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:10,036
AND YOU JUST WANT US TO KEEP
AT IT. TO KEEP GOING BACK?!

335
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:18,812
[WILLIAM] WELL I... I
HAVE RUN FROM SOMETHING.

336
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,614
[WILLIAM] AND IT'S
BEEN BOTHERING ME.

337
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:22,482
IT WASN'T LONG AGO.

338
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:27,353
AT THE FIRST ROUND TABLE, I
RAN AWAY FROM HELPING THE CITY.

339
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,556
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN MY
OWN PLANS.

340
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:34,027
I WANTED TO COMPLETE THE RAIDS I
HADN'T DONE YET. PRETTY SELFISH.

341
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,929
GOD, IT WAS SO STUPID!

342
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,432
AND SHORT SIGHTED!
HEH! WHAT A WASTE!

343
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,334
I THOUGHT I HAD
BETTER THINGS TO DO!

344
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,303
I HAD CONVINCED MYSELF THAT

345
00:16:43,403 --> 00:16:45,105
THEY WERE THE ONES FIGHTING A
LOST CAUSE

346
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:48,308
AND THEY WERE A BUNCH
OF IDIOTS FOR TAKING IT ON!

347
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:52,045
I'D BE LYING IF I SAID I DIDN'T
LOOK DOWN MY NOSE AT THEM.

348
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:55,381
SOUNDS FAMILIAR, RIGHT?
IT'S NOT EASY TO ADMIT.

349
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,418
I HAD LOST WHO I WAS
AND BETRAYED MYSELF.

350
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,955
I HAD BECOME THE VERY
THING I HATE SO MUCH.

351
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,524
[ALT WILLIAM] BUT I REMEMBER,

352
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,392
THERE WAS SOMEONE
WHO NEVER RAN AWAY.

353
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,597
I... I HAD ALWAYS ADMIRED HIM.

354
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,000
THERE WAS A LEGENDARY PARTY
THAT COMPETED

355
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,169
WITH MAJOR GUILDS ON
HIGH‐LEVEL QUESTS,

356
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,572
BUT NEVER FORMED A
GUILD OF THEIR OWN.

357
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:24,611
THEY REFERRED TO THEMSELVES AS
THE DEBAUCHERY TEA PARTY.

358
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,181
I ALWAYS LOOKED FORWARD TO
SEEING WHAT THEY WOULD DO NEXT!

359
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,618
AND I TOLD MYSELF THAT I
WOULD JOIN THEM SOMEDAY!

360
00:17:32,653 --> 00:17:38,058
BUT THEN, THEY BROKE UP
BEFORE I HIT LEVEL 90.

361
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,026
AND INSTEAD OF MAKING
GUILDS OF THEIR OWN,

362
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,328
THEY JUST WENT THEIR
SEPARATE WAYS.

363
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,630
I MEAN, IT WAS CRAZY, RIGHT?

364
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,932
YOU'RE OUT THERE AND
BETTER THAN EVERYBODY.

365
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,333
YOU GET EVERYONE
TALKING ABOUT YOU

366
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,270
AND THEN YOU JUST DISAPPEAR?!

367
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,238
YOU KNOW WHAT... TO BE HONEST...

368
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:56,309
I DIDN'T THINK THE ROUND TABLE
WAS EVER GOING TO WORK!

369
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,245
BUT SHIROE MADE IT HAPPEN, LIKE
HE DID THE TEA PARTY.

370
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,281
BUT INSTEAD OF BEATING BOSSES,

371
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,385
HE CREATED A CITY! AND IT'S
NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.

372
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,120
[ALT WILLIAM] SHIROE TOOK
CONTROL AND

373
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,789
MADE THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE.

374
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,425
I ADMIRE HIM FOR THAT. IT'S
WHY I FOLLOWED HIM OUT HERE!

375
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:13,960
[WILLIAM] ALL OF YOU WERE THERE

376
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,261
WHEN HE ASKED US
TO COME WITH HIM...

377
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:17,531
I WAS ACTUALLY FLATTERED
THAT HE ASKED ME!

378
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,333
WE MIGHT NOT HAVE A
CHANCE OF WINNING THIS...

379
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,704
BUT I WILL TRY AS LONG AS THE
VILLAIN IN GLASSES NEEDS ME!

380
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,873
I WILL BE READY TO SUIT
UP AND ENJOY THE RIDE!

381
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,478
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THIS GUY IS AS
SADISTIC AND CRAZY AS THEY COME!

382
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,749
AND YET, WE ALL
JOINED HIM ANYWAY.

383
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,418
BECAUSE WE KNEW IT'D BE
FUN AND THAT WE COULD WIN!

384
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,389
YOU KNOW WHY?! WE'RE GAMERS!
AND SHIROE HAS FAITH IN US!

385
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,730
MPH!

386
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,098
WHAT'RE WE WAITING FOR?

387
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,499
HUH?

388
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,069
LET'S DO IT, THOSE BOSSES
NEED A GOOD BEATING!

389
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:56,803
EH?

390
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,371
MMM!

391
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,139
UH?

392
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,907
HMMM!

393
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,408
MPH...

394
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,744
MPH.

395
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,812
MMM...

396
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:06,780
EH...

397
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,381
(GRUNT)

398
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,950
EH!

399
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,752
HMM...

400
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,386
(GRUNT)

401
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,988
MPH...

402
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:16,590
HMPH...

403
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,024
(GRUNTS)

404
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,392
HMMM...

405
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,460
(GRUNTS)

406
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,295
MHMMMM...

407
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:23,830
HMPH...

408
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,873
[WILLIAM, THINKING]
YEAH, OKAY, I WAS STUPID.

409
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,741
BUT I'M READY TO GO BACK IN
THERE

410
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,476
AND TAKE THESE BOSSES DOWN.

411
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,546
AND MOST OF ALL.
I WANT TO WIN.

412
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,783
AND I WANT TO DO IT WITH
MY FRIENDS, MY FAMILY.

413
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:48,354
[DEMICAS]
GUILD MASTER... (SCOFFS)

414
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,293
[NAOTSUGU] HEY, SHIROE!
YOU DONE SNOOZIN'?

415
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,861
[SHIROE] UH... HUH?

416
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,863
MM‐HM.

417
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,200
UH...?

418
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,605
(SHAKY HUMMING AND GIGGLES)

419
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:05,906
[SHIROE]
UH...

420
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,677
[NAOTSUGU] SILVER SWORD'S A HELL
OF A GUILD, AREN'T THEY?

421
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:11,945
[SHIROE]
YEAH...

422
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,314
[SHIROE, THINKING]
SERIOUSLY...

423
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,483
COULD I PULL OFF
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

424
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,653
IF MINORI AND TOYA WERE SAD...?

425
00:20:19,753 --> 00:20:22,455
IF ISUZU AND RUDY
WERE CRYING...?

426
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:24,658
IF IT CAME DOWN TO IT, I
DON'T KNOW IF I COULD FIND

427
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:27,227
THE WORDS TO TELL THEM WHAT
I'M REALLY FEELING...

428
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,196
WHAT IF AKATSUKI‐‐

429
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,933
DON'T WASTE TIME
WORRYING ABOUT ME.

430
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,868
I'M PROTECTING YOU, REMEMBER?!

431
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,302
MPH...

432
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,905
[TETORA] I WANNA HELP THEM WIN.
[SHIROE] UH...

433
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,774
[TETORA]
WELL? DON'T YOU, TOO?

434
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:43,109
[NAOTSUGU] I COULDN'T HAVE
SAID IT BETTER MYSELF!

435
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,946
YEAH, IT'S EASY FOR
A STARLET, YOU KNOW?

436
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,148
(EXHALE)

437
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,650
[NAOTSUGU] HMM? SO...

438
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,053
YOU GOT SOMETHING BREWING IN
THAT NOGGIN? MASTERMIND?

439
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:55,321
THERE IS SOMETHING I NEED TO
TELL YOU ABOUT, NAOTSUGU.

440
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,557
[NAOTSUGU] HUH?

441
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:57,991
[SHIROE] YOU TOO, TETORA.
[TETORA] HUH?

442
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,594
[SHIROE] AND I NEED TO TELL
SILVER SWORD AS WELL.

443
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,296
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD ALL OF YOU
WHY WE NEED TO FINISH THIS RAID,

444
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,231
WHAT THE ACTUAL PAYOFF IS,

445
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,033
AND WHY I NEED TO
GET MY HANDS ON

446
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:08,835
SUCH A HUGE STOCKPILE OF GOLD.

447
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,437
INSTEAD, I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF
EVERYONE'S TRUST IN ME.

448
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:15,241
YOU FOLLOWED ME, YET I
TRIED TO DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

449
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:17,477
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO FORGIVE
ME...

450
00:21:17,578 --> 00:21:19,546
I THINK I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA...

451
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,082
AND IT MIGHT JUST GIVE
US A BETTER CHANCE.

452
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,284
[TETORA]
HOW MUCH BETTER?

453
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,886
[NAOTSUGU]
UH...

454
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,453
FIFTEEN PERCENT.

455
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:29,690
[NAOTSUGU] SO YOU'RE
SAYIN' THERE'S A CHANCE!

456
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,091
WORKS FOR ME!

457
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:32,526
AND LASTLY,

458
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,261
I'LL NEED TO TALK TO
KINJO AND HIS TRIBE...

459
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:38,865
ABOUT OUR REQUEST AND
ALL OF YAMATO'S LAND.

460
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,767
NEXT TIME,

461
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,337
I WILL LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN THE
EYE AND TELL HIM WHAT WE NEED!

462
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,546
[NAOTSUGU] TOTALLY, I'LL TRY AND
MAKE IT BACK AS QUICK AS I CAN.

463
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,848
[MARIELLE, VOICE CHAT] I CAN'T
WAIT TO SEE YOU! I'LL HAVE

464
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:57,417
OZONI CHICKEN SOUP WAITING FOR
YOU. [TETORA] NAOTSUGU COME ON!

465
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,886
[NAOTSUGU]
WELL THAT'S QUITE AN INCENTIVE!

466
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,657
[SHIROE]
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, WE'RE ALL SET.

467
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,859
IT'S OUR LAST BATTLE OUT HERE.

468
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,428
MAYBE WE'LL HOLD OFF ON
THE NEW YEAR'S NOODLES THEN!

469
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:09,763
[SHIROE] (EXHALES) LET
THE CHIEF KNOW THAT

470
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:12,999
I'LL DEFINITELY BE
BACK BY THE SEVENTH.

471
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,669
I'VE ALSO GOT A FEW THINGS I'D
LIKE TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE.

472
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,305
THAT'S GOOD... MY LORD,
I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.

473
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:23,409
MM‐HM. I PROMISE, OKAY?
I'M COMING HOME...

474
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,411
HM?

475
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,580
[WILLIAM]
ALL RIGHT!

476
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,248
THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP US.

477
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,050
LET'S PLANT OUR BANNER,

478
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,852
AND CLAIM THIS ZONE AS OUR OWN!

479
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,954
(CHEER)

480
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,857
[SHIROE, THINKING] THAT'S RIGHT,

481
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:39,993
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
IT HOME THIS TIME...

482
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:42,529
AND I MEAN, ALL THE WAY HOME!

483
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,191
[AKATSUKI]
1, 2, 3, 4...

484
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,728
THE COUNT STARTS AGAIN.
FOR THE THREE RAID BOSSES.

485
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,497
THE PLAYERS ARE READY WITH
WEAPONS IN HAND,

486
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:25,866
A MENTAL IMAGE OF THE MAP AND

487
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,601
THE PLAN BURNED
INTO THEIR MEMORY.

488
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,903
THE CHANCE OF SUCCESS
IS ONLY 15%,

489
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:33,039
BUT COMRADES‐IN‐ARMS ARE
FIGHTING AT THEIR SIDES.

490
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,042
[SHIROE]
STAND UP, ONE MORE TIME!
