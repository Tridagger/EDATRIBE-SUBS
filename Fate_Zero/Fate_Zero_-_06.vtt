00:10.797 --> 00:12.357
See, see?
I told you so!

2
00:12.417 --> 00:14.821
This car takes the turns really fast!

3
00:15.336 --> 00:18.182
Well, that's because you're a surprisingly good driver.

4
00:20.123 --> 00:20.781
I know!

5
00:20.820 --> 00:23.881
You may not believe it,
but I practice all the time!

6
00:25.354 --> 00:30.250
Of all the toys Kiritsugu has brought me over the
years, this is my absolute favorite!

7
00:30.737 --> 00:32.336
This is a toy?

8
00:36.291 --> 00:41.427
At the castle, I was only allowed to drive
around the courtyard, so this is great!

9
00:42.075 --> 00:46.048
Shouldn't we have maybe hired a professional driver?

10
00:46.221 --> 00:47.720
No, that would be boring.

11
00:48.000 --> 00:49.600
I mean, it could be really dangerous.

12
00:49.700 --> 00:52.801
What if the enemy were to suddenly
launch an attack against us?

13
00:52.941 --> 00:54.847
Well, I suppose you have a point but...

14
00:55.191 --> 00:56.400
Stop the car!

15
01:03.115 --> 01:05.768
Irisviel, get out of the car

16
01:06.031 --> 01:07.783
and stay very close to me.

17
01:08.451 --> 01:10.041
This presence...

18
01:10.041 --> 01:11.487
it's a Servant!

19
02:55.480 --> 02:59.000
I have come for you, my sweet and holy virgin!

20
03:02.650 --> 03:04.090
Do you know this man?

21
03:04.320 --> 03:05.976
I've never laid eyes on him.

22
03:06.475 --> 03:07.722
Oh no!

23
03:07.823 --> 03:10.755
Are you saying that you've forgotten my face?

24
03:10.822 --> 03:11.822
Forgotten you?

25
03:11.950 --> 03:13.436
I've never met you in my life.

26
03:13.639 --> 03:15.186
You mistake me for another.

27
03:15.286 --> 03:16.679
Agh!

28
03:16.830 --> 03:17.652
It's me!

29
03:17.766 --> 03:20.012
It's Gilles de Rais, my darling!

30
03:20.250 --> 03:24.964
I have prayed for your resurrection and have
been waiting for a miracle to reunite us!

31
03:25.130 --> 03:29.995
To that end, I've come all this
way, to the end of time, my Jeanne!

32
03:30.799 --> 03:31.679
Who is Jeanne?

33
03:31.768 --> 03:33.905
I know not your name, I assure you.

34
03:34.100 --> 03:37.202
Nor have I any idea who this Jeanne might be.

35
03:37.850 --> 03:38.569
No...

36
03:39.875 --> 03:41.697
No, you can't
have forgotten!

37
03:41.810 --> 03:43.781
Not your former identity!

38
03:43.900 --> 03:46.287
As you have seen fit to give me your name,

39
03:46.690 --> 03:50.514
then I must, in keeping with
the chivalric code, give mine.

40
03:51.049 --> 03:52.479
My name is Arturia,

41
03:52.990 --> 03:54.593
the heir to Uther Pendragon,

42
03:55.166 --> 03:56.412
and King of Britain.

43
03:56.783 --> 03:59.993
I enter this battle in the Saber class.

44
04:00.045 --> 04:01.199
Oh no!

45
04:01.330 --> 04:02.479
How tragic!

46
04:02.540 --> 04:04.130
It's so very sad!

47
04:04.218 --> 04:07.682
She's lost her memory and gone completely insane!

48
04:08.660 --> 04:09.928
Curse Him.

49
04:09.975 --> 04:11.065
Curse Him!

50
04:11.107 --> 04:15.884
Such cruel tortures God inflicts upon my
beautiful maiden! Such horrible injustices!

51
04:15.924 --> 04:16.431
Enough!

52
04:16.486 --> 04:17.735
You embarrass yourself!

53
04:18.060 --> 04:19.670
Awaken, O fair one.

54
04:19.890 --> 04:22.749
You have no need to call yourself Saber any longer.

55
04:22.980 --> 04:25.893
Because the Holy Grail War has already ended.

56
04:26.070 --> 04:31.122
The Grail has chosen me, Gilles,
to be its champion, with no fighting at all!

57
04:31.265 --> 04:37.663
For, you see, my one and only eternal wish, the
resurrection of Jeanne d'Arc, has finally been granted!

58
04:43.649 --> 04:44.726
Ha...

59
04:48.065 --> 04:54.452
If you mock the true prayers of all the other
heroes again, the next strike will be real!

60
04:54.795 --> 04:56.087
Now rise!

61
04:56.640 --> 05:00.197
Has your heart been sealed so
tightly, my dearest Jeanne?

62
05:00.309 --> 05:01.149
Very well.

63
05:01.230 --> 05:02.156
That's too bad.

64
05:02.372 --> 05:05.295
If drastic measures are called for to free your heart,

65
05:05.386 --> 05:08.027
I will take my leave of you to go and prepare.

66
05:08.462 --> 05:10.074
I swear to you, Jeanne!

67
05:10.240 --> 05:15.883
I will not rest until I can free your soul
from the terrible prison of God's cruel curse.

68
05:22.790 --> 05:26.627
It's very difficult to deal with one who
ignores everything that you're saying.

69
05:26.920 --> 05:29.646
Next time, I shall strike before he speaks!

70
05:29.800 --> 05:32.356
His type completely infuriates me.

71
05:32.510 --> 05:35.569
However, this encounter may have
actually been a fortunate one.

72
05:37.140 --> 05:41.673
I sensed that he was too dangerous to
face without the full use of my left hand.

73
05:49.125 --> 05:52.812
Following Saber's Master has yielded unexpected fruits.

74
05:52.860 --> 05:54.914
We found Caster as well.

75
05:55.280 --> 05:57.993
Of course, we must follow him.

76
05:59.660 --> 06:01.263
Ah, no, no.

77
06:01.540 --> 06:03.516
The thumb needs to go like this!

78
06:07.703 --> 06:08.941
That's nice!

79
06:10.000 --> 06:11.647
Perfect in fact!

80
06:17.140 --> 06:18.892
Welcome back, big guy.

81
06:23.480 --> 06:24.161
Hey!

82
06:24.256 --> 06:25.401
What the hell?

83
06:25.670 --> 06:27.225
Accursed God!

84
06:27.520 --> 06:31.721
He keeps an iron grip on Jeanne's
soul, refusing to let go!

85
06:31.820 --> 06:35.782
By Jeanne I assume you mean the
girl you saw in the crystal ball?

86
06:36.570 --> 06:39.669
We must prove the cold hear talked to her!

87
06:39.870 --> 06:42.789
That God's power is gone and my love wasted!

88
06:43.000 --> 06:45.061
That no deed no matter how foul,

89
06:45.160 --> 06:48.711
no crime no matter how horrible
is worthy of God's punishment!

90
06:49.040 --> 06:50.597
Yeah, I get it.

91
06:50.779 --> 06:52.757
You're even cooler than I thought!

92
06:53.050 --> 06:57.180
Therefore, we require greater
depravities, greater blasphemies.

93
06:57.180 --> 07:01.066
We must erect a veritable Tower
of Babel of human sacrifices!

94
07:01.802 --> 07:07.766
Mmm, uh, so basically,
from now on it's quantity over quality?

95
07:07.839 --> 07:08.785
Indeed!

96
07:08.959 --> 07:10.263
Exactly so!

97
07:10.777 --> 07:12.689
Impressive, Ryunosuke.

98
07:13.030 --> 07:17.132
Our first step will be sacrificing
the eleven in their cells right away.

99
07:17.549 --> 07:21.568
And then, we'll go acquire some
more children for our revelries.

100
07:24.410 --> 07:26.642
It's kind of a waste, don't you think?

101
07:28.039 --> 07:29.229
Uh...

102
07:30.365 --> 07:32.695
We interrupt this regularly scheduled program

103
07:32.845 --> 07:35.782
to bring you this important breaking news.

104
07:36.075 --> 07:38.090
An unexplained explosion has occurred

105
07:38.245 --> 07:40.887
in the Fuyuki Coastal Warehouse District.

106
07:41.631 --> 07:43.800
We go live to the scene.

107
07:45.310 --> 07:48.580
Why did you fail to finish
off Saber when you faced her?

108
07:48.730 --> 07:50.263
Not once but twice.

109
07:50.385 --> 07:54.734
You made me waste the Command Seal,
and yet you couldn't finish the job, idiot!

110
07:56.360 --> 08:00.024
Was your encounter with Saber
really that much fun for you?

111
08:00.355 --> 08:02.159
It wasn't like that, Master.

112
08:04.963 --> 08:10.222
I swear on my honor as a knight, as a Servant
of the Grail War, I will bring you Saber's head.

113
08:10.420 --> 08:12.744
You don't need to swear to me again!

114
08:12.903 --> 08:13.990
Of course you will!

115
08:14.150 --> 08:17.609
You made a pact with me to defeat
all others for the Holy Grail.

116
08:17.813 --> 08:22.225
And now you sit there like a sniveling fool
swearing to bring me the head of Saber?

117
08:22.403 --> 08:24.523
What about this do you not understand!?

118
08:24.658 --> 08:27.370
Aren't you the one who's mistaken here,

119
08:27.823 --> 08:29.516
Lord El‐Melloi?

120
08:31.703 --> 08:32.756
Sola‐Ui.

121
08:32.993 --> 08:34.944
Lancer actually did well.

122
08:35.111 --> 08:37.899
I'm afraid you're the one who made the mistake.

123
08:38.212 --> 08:41.340
Saber is a highly skilled and powerful Servant.

124
08:41.719 --> 08:45.943
I simply couldn't allow a chance to
defeat her pass me by without trying.

125
08:46.231 --> 08:49.011
He inflicted a wound on her that cannot heal.

126
08:49.257 --> 08:52.092
By letting her go, you can defeat her at your leisure.

127
08:52.442 --> 08:58.428
If you're that concerned about her and her lauded
abilities, why didn't you go after her Master instead?

128
08:58.648 --> 09:00.881
You merely stayed hidden and watched.

129
09:00.954 --> 09:02.204
Rather pathetic.

130
09:04.023 --> 09:05.346
Honestly, Kayneth.

131
09:05.565 --> 09:10.035
It isn't that you don't understand your
distinct advantage over all the other Masters.

132
09:10.408 --> 09:12.535
You were the one who ensured that.

133
09:13.106 --> 09:16.579
You made a special alteration
to the usual Master‐Servant pact

134
09:16.604 --> 09:19.206
that no one other than
I knows anything about.

135
09:19.409 --> 09:24.928
You control Command Seals, and I act as an
additional Master and supply the Servant mana.

136
09:25.333 --> 09:26.296
Brilliant.

137
09:26.423 --> 09:30.096
You weren't the Evocation Division's
brightest star for nothing, you know?

138
09:31.713 --> 09:34.354
But we must take care at the beginning.

139
09:34.443 --> 09:35.563
Must we now?

140
09:35.722 --> 09:38.588
So you'll hide while you make Lancer take all the risks?

141
09:38.628 --> 09:40.428
All right, that's enough of that.

142
09:41.716 --> 09:44.606
Any more will be an insult to my Master.

143
09:45.553 --> 09:47.908
As a knight, I cannot allow it.

144
09:48.863 --> 09:51.462
No, I didn't mean it like that!

145
09:51.733 --> 09:53.508
I've overstepped my bounds.

146
09:53.743 --> 09:54.661
I'm sorry.

147
10:05.253 --> 10:05.993
What?

148
10:06.083 --> 10:07.083
What's going on?

149
10:15.973 --> 10:17.647
Yes, I understand.

150
10:18.593 --> 10:20.613
There's a fire on the lower levels.

151
10:20.723 --> 10:23.428
It can't be anything but an act of arson, of course.

152
10:23.603 --> 10:24.450
Arson?

153
10:24.773 --> 10:26.218
Tonight, of all nights?

154
10:26.332 --> 10:28.231
They wish to empty the building.

155
10:28.385 --> 10:30.491
Then it's an attack.

156
10:31.903 --> 10:35.498
Saber's Master will want to take
down Lancer as soon as possible

157
10:35.813 --> 10:38.248
to lift his spear's curse and make her whole.

158
10:38.570 --> 10:41.756
Lancer, go downstairs now and defeat her.

159
10:42.006 --> 10:43.806
Don't just drive her off this time.

160
10:43.873 --> 10:45.268
Understood, Master.

161
10:45.463 --> 10:51.161
Let's see to it that our honored guest enjoys the
amazing magical workshop of Kayneth El‐Melloi.

162
10:51.753 --> 10:55.288
A perfect workshop requiring an entire floor.

163
10:55.593 --> 10:57.303
Twenty‐four layered barriers,

164
10:57.303 --> 10:58.933
three mana generators,

165
10:58.933 --> 11:02.433
dozens of ghosts and spirits
roaming as guard dogs.

166
11:02.433 --> 11:07.069
Thousands of traps and parts of
hallways that open into other worlds.

167
11:09.894 --> 11:15.022
We shall avail ourselves of all the
magical techniques we have at our disposal.

168
11:15.573 --> 11:17.766
I shall make you retract your statements

169
11:18.203 --> 11:20.331
that I am pathetic very shortly.

170
11:20.663 --> 11:21.146
Oh?

171
11:21.283 --> 11:22.726
I look forward to it.

172
11:30.083 --> 11:31.435
Mr. Archibald!

173
11:32.133 --> 11:34.954
Mr. Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald!

174
11:35.448 --> 11:36.803
Are you present here?

175
11:36.803 --> 11:37.395
Yes.

176
11:38.883 --> 11:39.846
That was me.

177
11:40.093 --> 11:41.039
Don't worry.

178
11:43.263 --> 11:48.508
Both Kayneth El‐Melloi Archibald
and his wife Sola‐Ui have exited.

179
11:51.646 --> 11:52.316
Hm.

180
11:52.463 --> 11:53.529
Oh, I see.

181
11:53.983 --> 11:55.386
Yes, yes, that's right.

182
11:57.472 --> 11:59.262
Everyone has evacuated.

183
11:59.363 --> 12:00.129
Good.

184
12:01.813 --> 12:03.693
Everything is ready on my end.

185
12:03.773 --> 12:04.523
And you?

186
12:04.548 --> 12:05.281
All green.

187
12:05.600 --> 12:07.033
Just give the word.

188
12:46.493 --> 12:47.226
Maiya?

189
12:47.439 --> 12:49.699
The target never even moved from his position.

190
12:49.753 --> 12:52.145
He didn't leave the hotel before the explosion.

191
12:52.253 --> 12:54.773
A free fall
from 150 meters.

192
12:56.003 --> 12:58.402
No magical
barrier known to man

193
12:58.883 --> 13:00.595
could've saved him from that.

194
13:11.353 --> 13:13.308
Maiya, withdraw.

195
13:20.573 --> 13:22.806
To blow up the entire building...

196
13:23.572 --> 13:27.878
I can't believe a mage would
actually do something like that.

197
13:28.333 --> 13:33.446
Then again, I suppose he is
excellent at outsmarting mages.

198
13:34.095 --> 13:36.262
Kirei Kotomine.

199
13:36.349 --> 13:37.026
Oh?

200
13:37.239 --> 13:39.255
I don't believe
we've ever met.

201
13:40.114 --> 13:43.707
Or do you have a good reason why
you would know who I am already?

202
13:43.933 --> 13:46.933
Well, in that case, I can guess who you are.

203
13:48.023 --> 13:50.869
Don't make me stand here doing all the talking, woman.

204
13:51.063 --> 13:53.253
One word from you will suffice.

205
13:53.420 --> 13:56.374
Tell me, where is the man who should have been here

206
13:56.523 --> 13:57.758
instead of you?

207
14:06.613 --> 14:08.812
Not bad, not bad at all.

208
14:09.023 --> 14:10.796
You seem to have some training.

209
14:26.676 --> 14:27.551
Hm.

210
14:35.143 --> 14:37.924
There's no way she threw this gas canister.

211
14:48.283 --> 14:49.252
No matter.

212
14:49.473 --> 14:55.195
Just the knowledge that someone was here to save her
from the situation means tonight wasn't a total waste.

213
14:57.623 --> 14:58.673
Master Kirei.

214
14:58.746 --> 15:02.812
I thought I gave you explicit orders
to stay hidden and not to expose yourself.

215
15:03.032 --> 15:04.423
My apologies, Master.

216
15:04.498 --> 15:08.448
But there is some important news that I
thought you should hear without delay.

217
15:08.568 --> 15:11.303
We've located the Servant Caster.

218
15:13.904 --> 15:17.123
After having Assassin perform a detailed investigation,

219
15:17.313 --> 15:21.371
we learned that Caster and his Master
have kidnapped children from their beds

220
15:21.564 --> 15:24.568
in the town of Miyama and the next town over.

221
15:24.781 --> 15:27.125
By dawn, they had taken fifteen.

222
15:27.420 --> 15:28.586
I would imagine

223
15:29.050 --> 15:33.796
that they are the serial killer that's been reported
in the news and that everyone is worried about.

224
15:34.661 --> 15:37.795
They use magic without even the slightest hesitation,

225
15:38.082 --> 15:41.286
and seem to be doing absolutely
nothing to hide their tracks.

226
15:41.914 --> 15:46.459
It is quite possible that they are not
even thinking of the Holy Grail War.

227
15:47.473 --> 15:49.683
A mad Servant out of control

228
15:49.789 --> 15:52.682
and a Master who doesn't even try to control him.

229
15:53.370 --> 15:56.558
Why are people like them participating in the Grail War?

230
15:56.865 --> 15:59.442
This is something we cannot ignore, Tokiomi.

231
16:00.097 --> 16:04.436
Their actions are in clear violation
of the rules by which we are all bound.

232
16:04.596 --> 16:05.436
Of course.

233
16:05.516 --> 16:09.801
As one responsible for guarding the secrets of
magic, this cannot be allowed.

234
16:10.291 --> 16:14.471
Uh, we shall have to eliminate
Caster as well as his Master.

235
16:14.638 --> 16:15.453
Yes.

236
16:15.539 --> 16:19.338
But the problem is that defeating
a Servant requires a Servant,

237
16:19.638 --> 16:23.144
and we can't send my Assassin
without exposing our deception.

238
16:23.706 --> 16:24.516
Ah.

239
16:26.593 --> 16:29.829
Minor rule changes fall completely under my purview.

240
16:30.075 --> 16:33.713
We'll have all of the Masters
work as a group to defeat Caster.

241
16:38.778 --> 16:39.688
Archer?

242
16:39.978 --> 16:44.352
There are far fewer bottles here than in
Tokiomi's room, but of higher quality.

243
16:44.438 --> 16:46.632
I must say that's some apprentice he has.

244
16:46.819 --> 16:48.310
What is it you want?

245
16:48.827 --> 16:54.001
Apparently, there are those in this war other than
myself with an abundance of time on their hands.

246
16:55.286 --> 16:56.406
What do you mean?

247
16:56.600 --> 17:00.320
Otherwise, a Master existing
under the kind protection of the Church

248
17:00.433 --> 17:02.177
would hardly need to wander about.

249
17:02.330 --> 17:04.316
I don't know what you're talking about.

250
17:04.791 --> 17:08.935
Are you dissatisfied with your Master, Gilgamesh?

251
17:09.343 --> 17:13.413
Tokiomi invited me to this world
and maintains my form here.

252
17:13.573 --> 17:18.416
His greeting was worthy of my elevated station,
and so I felt that I had to respond to that.

253
17:19.380 --> 17:22.915
But I never expected that he'd
be such a dull and boring person.

254
17:23.055 --> 17:25.690
So you are unhappy with him as your Master.

255
17:26.201 --> 17:28.394
He wants to reach the Vortex of the Root.

256
17:28.902 --> 17:31.422
What a boring and tedious little plan.

257
17:33.757 --> 17:38.138
The unflinching desire for
the "Root" is unique to mages.

258
17:38.636 --> 17:41.241
It's not for outsiders to comment upon.

259
17:42.014 --> 17:46.963
In a sense, the path to the "Root" is
the path to an escape from this world.

260
17:47.354 --> 17:50.691
For us, who are interested only in the world itself,

261
17:50.891 --> 17:53.182
it may well be a tedious plan.

262
17:53.927 --> 17:55.228
Is that so?

263
17:55.881 --> 17:56.549
True.

264
17:56.736 --> 18:00.084
I am full of love for this universe
that is my personal playground.

265
18:00.874 --> 18:03.899
I have no interest in realms outside my dominion.

266
18:04.084 --> 18:06.931
This "Root" of yours does not concern me in the least.

267
18:07.018 --> 18:07.924
Perhaps.

268
18:08.338 --> 18:11.965
But the Grail is not a device
specifically designed to seek the Root.

269
18:12.224 --> 18:14.315
When we say that it is omnipotent,

270
18:14.634 --> 18:19.390
we mean that it has limitless potential
to alter even the reality of the material world.

271
18:19.739 --> 18:21.718
So you're saying the other Masters

272
18:21.793 --> 18:25.832
have motives other than Tokiomi's
for wanting to obtain the Holy Grail.

273
18:25.912 --> 18:28.165
Tokiomi is an archetypal mage,

274
18:28.354 --> 18:30.960
and at the same time extremely orthodox.

275
18:31.199 --> 18:36.446
What the other Masters seek is one form or
another of success here in the material world:

276
18:36.797 --> 18:39.366
prestige, desires, power.

277
18:39.643 --> 18:40.974
That suits me fine.

278
18:41.264 --> 18:43.256
I love every one of those things.

279
18:43.596 --> 18:47.242
You are a king who rules over
the profane and the vulgar,

280
18:47.574 --> 18:48.734
Gilgamesh.

281
18:48.847 --> 18:52.434
So what is it that motivates you, Kirei?

282
18:58.514 --> 19:00.566
What do you want from the Holy Grail?

283
19:00.818 --> 19:01.666
Me?

284
19:02.311 --> 19:03.231
Nothing.

285
19:03.604 --> 19:05.819
I have no real desire for it.

286
19:06.157 --> 19:07.828
I seriously doubt that.

287
19:08.224 --> 19:13.356
Doesn't the Holy Grail call only those Masters
whom it considers worthy of possessing it?

288
19:13.494 --> 19:14.758
So they say.

289
19:15.067 --> 19:16.777
But why did it choose me?

290
19:16.944 --> 19:19.416
I have no ideal or other desire.

291
19:19.564 --> 19:21.667
So why choose me for this battle?

292
19:21.907 --> 19:24.455
No ideal or other desire?

293
19:24.743 --> 19:27.392
Then why not simply wish for something like joy?

294
19:27.588 --> 19:28.708
Ridiculous!

295
19:28.787 --> 19:29.838
Wish for joy?

296
19:30.017 --> 19:33.518
You'd ask me to long for something
that blasphemous and sinful?

297
19:33.747 --> 19:36.462
Blasphemous and sinful you say?

298
19:36.714 --> 19:38.368
That's going a little far, isn't it?

299
19:38.661 --> 19:40.972
Why the connection between joy and sin?

300
19:42.543 --> 19:43.567
Well, I...

301
19:44.699 --> 19:48.360
True, joy gained by evil
means could be considered sin.

302
19:48.551 --> 19:51.555
But joy may be attained through good deeds as well.

303
19:52.024 --> 19:55.212
What kind of philosophy calls joy itself a sin?

304
19:55.297 --> 19:57.058
It's absolutely ludicrous.

305
19:57.864 --> 20:00.179
Joy is another quality that I lack.

306
20:00.690 --> 20:03.312
I seek it, but never find it.

307
20:04.434 --> 20:06.084
Kirei Kotomine,

308
20:07.624 --> 20:09.965
I find myself interested in you.

309
20:11.201 --> 20:12.205
What do you mean?

310
20:12.967 --> 20:14.826
Exactly what I said.

311
20:15.034 --> 20:16.006
Be seated.

312
20:22.575 --> 20:24.116
True joy, you see,

313
20:24.309 --> 20:26.709
might be thought of as a form of the soul.

314
20:27.102 --> 20:29.935
The question isn't whether it exists or not,

315
20:30.223 --> 20:31.690
but whether you know it.

316
20:32.245 --> 20:36.600
Kirei, you have yet to see
what form your soul has taken.

317
20:36.885 --> 20:40.918
That's what it actually means when you
claim that you lack joy in your life.

318
20:41.125 --> 20:42.730
You're just a mere Servant

319
20:42.822 --> 20:44.845
and you dare sit there and lecture me?

320
20:44.937 --> 20:46.483
Don't get cocky, mongrel.

321
20:46.870 --> 20:50.693
I am a king who has tasted all the
pleasures the world has to offer.

322
20:50.980 --> 20:52.806
Hold your tongue and listen.

323
20:55.185 --> 20:58.346
Kirei, you ought to learn what pleasure is.

324
20:58.525 --> 21:00.401
Look first to the outside.

325
21:01.384 --> 21:02.143
I know.

326
21:02.829 --> 21:05.404
Why not begin by joining me in my entertainment?

327
21:07.035 --> 21:10.579
I have no time to waste on pointless trivialities.

328
21:11.008 --> 21:12.213
Don't be like that.

329
21:12.666 --> 21:15.579
You can do it between the jobs Tokiomi assigns you.

330
21:16.521 --> 21:22.764
To begin with, your task is to keep watch over
the five other Masters, isn't that correct?

331
21:23.497 --> 21:24.383
What of it?

332
21:24.563 --> 21:29.800
You should investigate not only their plans,
but their motivations for obtaining the Grail as well.

333
21:29.980 --> 21:31.888
Then give that information to me.

334
21:32.855 --> 21:36.118
That would be possible if I ask the Assassins.

335
21:36.892 --> 21:40.265
But, Archer, what does any of that matter to you?

336
21:41.105 --> 21:42.427
I've already told you.

337
21:42.655 --> 21:44.286
I enjoy watching humans.

338
21:44.580 --> 21:48.669
One or two of them are sure to be interesting
enough to keep me entertained for a while.

339
21:49.017 --> 21:51.851
Compared to that dull Tokiomi at least.

340
21:53.825 --> 21:55.509
Very well, Archer.

341
21:55.745 --> 21:56.649
I will accept.

342
21:56.995 --> 21:59.708
But it will take some time to do it.

343
21:59.860 --> 22:00.755
That's fine.

344
22:00.965 --> 22:02.288
I shall wait patiently

345
22:02.755 --> 22:05.453
as I avail myself of these drinks.

346
22:11.242 --> 22:13.633
My reason for seeking the Holy Grail?

347
22:14.225 --> 22:16.561
I said far more than I should have.

348
22:18.422 --> 22:21.528
I know that it certainly isn't joy.

349
22:28.448 --> 22:32.516
However, if I can learn about him,

350
22:33.233 --> 22:35.604
will I also be able to learn

351
22:36.238 --> 22:38.390
what it is I seek as well?

352
22:41.045 --> 22:43.904
Kiritsugu Emiya.

353
24:18.645 --> 24:21.475
I am temporarily altering the rules of the Grail War.
