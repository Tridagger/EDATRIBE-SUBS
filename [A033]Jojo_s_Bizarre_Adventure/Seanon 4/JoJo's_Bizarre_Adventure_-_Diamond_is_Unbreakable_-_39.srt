Reimi: Now, at long last,

353
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,930
we can finally pass on together.

354
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,980
Koichi: What?! Are you
really leaving us, reimi?

355
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,050
Surely it wouldn’t hurt anything

356
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,820
if you stayed
a little while longer.

357
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,850
I mean, you’ve been like
a guardian angel to this town.

358
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,090
I can’t imagine
life here without you!

359
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,890
Please, you have to stay!

360
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,530
Reimi: Koichi,
you’re very sweet,

361
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,060
but Arnold and I have done

362
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,930
everything we set out
to accomplish here.

363
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,900
the time’s come
for us to leave morioh.

364
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,040
That’s how it has to be.

365
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,570
so, little Rohan,
do you think you’re gonna cry

366
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,970
after we’ve gone off
to the great beyond?

367
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,380
( Rohan chuckles )
In your dreams.

368
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,880
what reason
would I have to miss you?

369
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:06,210
You died 15 years ago,
making you a distant memory.

370
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,450
I’ve said this before,

371
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
but spirits
should really just let go.

372
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,190
Haunting the world of the living
is so out of style.

373
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,420
A soul’s final resting place
isn’t here with us,

374
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,090
but exploring
the uncharted afterlife.

375
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,090
( Koichi groans )

376
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,260

379
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,430
Fine! I’ll say it, all right?!

380
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,100
But i’m only doing so because
i’ll never see you again!

381
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,440
- I’ll miss you!
- ( Koichi laughs )

382
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,140

I don’t want you to go!

come to say goodbye.

It feels weird to say this

394

but take care of yourself.

thank you so much
for all you’ve done!

401
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,590
You saved this little town when
it needed a savior the most!

402
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,520
reimi: Thank you
for saying that, koichi,

403
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,160
but we saved morioh,
all of us together.

404

as we draw breath,

405

no one here today will ever
forget you or your bravery.

406

Reimi: Thank you, all.

407
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,930
That means the world.

408

So long, my friends. Be well.

Shinobu: Where is he?
it’s so late.

414
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,060
I guess he’s working overtime.

415
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,060
It would have been nice
if he called, though.

416

you haven’t touched your food.

418
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,900
hurry up
before it gets cold.

419
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,210
If you’re waiting for me,
i’ll eat when dad gets home.

Hayato: It’s okay, mom.
I’ll wait with you.

423
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,190
When dad gets home, we’ll all
sit down and eat together,

424
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,220
’cause that’s
what a family does, right?

425
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,320
Shinobu: Sure.

426
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,060
Say, am I imagining things,

427
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,260
or have you
gotten taller lately?

428
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,600
Koichi: When all
was said and done,

429
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,030
our little morioh
wasn’t the town it used to be.

430
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,440
A monster named yoshikage Kira
swept in like a plague

431
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,340
and had his way
with our beloved home.

432
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,680
Hayato’s mother will no doubt
wait for her husband

433
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,410
until the end of time,

434
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,180
and shigechi’s parents
will never stop waiting

435
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,320
for their special
little man to return.

436
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,190
Whether a son, daughter,
brother, or sister,

437
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,060
kira’s victims belong to parents
who will never give up hope,

438
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,060
and yet that hope

439
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,960
will only cause their pain
to grow deeper.

440
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,470
The question is, what can
we do to lessen this burden?

441
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,940
Will a vile past
consume our future,

442
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,440
or will we be able to forge
ahead, unfettered by fear?

443
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,480
I wish I could say.

444
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,480
Joseph: How ’bout it, jotaro?

445
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,580
You worried about
what might happen

446
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,280
when we leave this place?

447
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,020
Jotaro: I am, just a bit.

448
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,320
Joseph: Because of all this,
we’ve had the chance

449
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,490
to see how capable
josuke and his friends are,

450
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,630
and there’s one thing I can say
with absolute certainty.

451
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,100
The young people
living in this town

452
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,460
are heroes one and all,

453
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,370
and each one of them
possesses a heart of gold.

454
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,030
They’ve the same
righteous hearts

455
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,270
we witnessed
on our journey to Egypt.

456
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,240
They carry a spirit of radiance

457
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,210
that will fight for true justice
above all else.

458
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,440
I see it in josuke,
as well as the others.

459
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,510
Morioh’s in good hands
with them.

460
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,180
As long as they’re here,
we have nothing to worry about.

461
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,690
Josuke: Hey, old man!

462
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,390
Don’t just stand there gawkin’!
Answer me!

463
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,360
Joseph: Well, then, guess it’s
time for me to say goodbye

464
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,360
to a great son who’s made
his father so very proud.

465
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,200
Josuke: Hey, remember
that picture of mom

466
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,600
I gave you a while ago?

467
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,230
You don’t still have it,
do you?

468
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,400
Joseph: ’course I do!

469
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,500
I put it in my wallet
for safekeeping,

470
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,340
just like you told me to! Hah!

471
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,740
Since I can’t tell her
in person, i’ll tell you.

472
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,280
i wish her
all the happiness in the world.

473
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,550
Josuke: So, funny thing
about that picture I gave you.

474
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,050
I decided to hang on to a piece.

475
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,690
Shining diamond!

476
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,750
Joseph: Eh?

477
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,120
Josuke: Oh, wow,

478
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,290
you shouldn’t have!

479
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,190
Though i’ll take it
if you insist!

480
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,760
We’ll just call this gift
16 years of back allowance!

481
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,430
Besides, think about what
your better half would say

482
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,170
if you took that picture
home with you!

483
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,440
joseph: Who does
that cocky punk think he is?

484
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,110
Jotaro: I’m starting to see
that golden spirit, old man,

485
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,770
and he’s seeing it
all the way to the bank.

Rose to the occasion

492

and began an adventure
as a new dad.

493
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,360
Jotaro kujo finally finished
a doctoral thesis he began

494
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,230
on a species of starfish
he found on a beach in morioh,

495
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,570
earning him his phd.

made us a special lunch?
