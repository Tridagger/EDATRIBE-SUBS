a good day, sweetie pie.

Aww. That’s too bad.

361

A goodbye kiss
would have been nice.

362

Although, I feel as though
we’re closer than ever,

363
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,840
and before long,

364
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,050
my seductive love
will overwhelm him.

365
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,490
Hayato: He put his shoes on
with a shoehorn,

366
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,760
and he was definitely wearing
25.5-centimeter-sized shoes.

367
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,160
Why does he have shoes
that are two different sizes?

368
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,900
Even weirder, mom and dad are
getting along better than ever,

369
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,900
and he scarfed down
those mushrooms

370

even though he hates them.

371

Hmph. This is also bizarre.

372
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,970
why in the world
would he need to practice

373
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,810

over and over again?

374
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,180

What could he be doing

378
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,630
with that much soil
and a bag of cat food?

379
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,960
Then he goes into the closet
