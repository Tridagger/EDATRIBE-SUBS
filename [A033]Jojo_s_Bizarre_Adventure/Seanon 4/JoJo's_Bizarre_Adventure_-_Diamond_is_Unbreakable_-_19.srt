What you’ve brought us

tell you that’s very peculiar.

Not a single store in morioh
sells lottery tickets,

for everyone involved.

We’ll cash it in three days,
as planned.

184

the money the way we said,

185

you stop to think about it,

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,310
I made it squirt
right into your veins.

344
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,310
Josuke: Wait! You what?! Uhh.

345
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,920
( Both gasp )

346
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,920
- Okuyasu: Aw, get off!
- ( Josuke grunting )

347
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,390
Shigechi: When alcohol
goes directly into the veins,

348
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,760
you don’t need that much until
you’re shitfaced and flailing.

349
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,330
Josuke: I knew alcohol could be
used as a makeshift anesthetic,

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,390
but I never thought a kid
would figure that out,

351
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,800
let alone use it
to whammy me like this!

352
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,800
Looks like he’s not
a total idiot after all.

353
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,900
No, it must be
his instinct again.

354
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,440
( Okuyasu groans )
He’s dead meat.

355
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,310
I might be a little tipsy,
but there’s no way

356
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,210
that’s gonna stop
me from ending you!

357
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,910
( Gasps )

358
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,850
- ( Screams ) My frickin’ eye!
- Josuke: No!

359
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,290
okuyasu: What are you
waitin’ for, josuke?! Fix it!

360
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,390
josuke: Shit!
Hang in there! I’m on it!

361
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,520
Shigechi: If i’m remembering
everything correctly,

362
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,530
you two dick-wads
called me a whole bunch

363
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,000
of shitty names earlier,
didn’t you?

364
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,830
I’m gonna show you what happens

365
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,770
when you try to pull the wool
over my eyes

366
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,300
and treat me like a dumb kid.

367
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,300
( Josuke groans ) Damn you.

368
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
You’re standing there
all high and mighty

369
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,110
when you breaking your promise
is what started this!

370
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,210
I’ve had about all I can take!

371
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,910
Keep this up, and you’re
not gonna like what comes next.

372
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,480
( Shigechi scoffs )
I think you’ve done

373
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,180
more than enough talkin’
for one life, jerk-suke,

374
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,550
and since your stand’s weak,

375
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,790
your bite can’t even
back up your puny bark.

376
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,190
actually,
both of your stands are shit,

377
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,230
so save the demands until you’re
half as strong as harvest.

378
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,990
’til then, take it in the eye!

379
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,800
Okuyasu: Quick, josuke!
close your eye!

380
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,830
- ( Josuke screams )
- Okuyasu: You okay?

381
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,530
Shigechi: Damn! So close.

382
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,470
there’s no point
in closing your eyes, f.Y.I.

383
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,370
Harvest can grab anything,
no matter the obstacle.

384
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,880
Shut those peepers
as tight as you want.

385
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,280
It’ll just tear off
your eyelids

386
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,280
and gouge out the eye.

387
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,980
Okuyasu: We get the point,
shigechi. Stop it!

388
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,420
Just forgive us already.

389
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,490
it’s not like
we wanted this to happen.

390
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,290
Shigechi: Huh?
Was that an apology?

391
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,490
Josuke: Damn it, kid!

392
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,830
i have had it
with your shitty attitude!

393
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,560
Shigechi: Hear that, okuyasu?
Josuke seems to be

394
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,500
on a completely different page
from you.

395
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,300
Okuyasu: Don’t worry about him!
He’ll come around! ( Pants )

396
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,030
But how about we give you this?

397
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,440
( Shigechi gasps )

398
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,540
Okuyasu: It’s the 10,000 yen
you gave me,

399
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,040
plus everything else
I have on me right now.

400
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,880
Take it as our penance for all
the trouble we’ve caused.

401
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,310
please, shigechi, i’m
begging you not to off josuke!

402
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,880
If he gets taken out,
who’ll fix my eye?

403
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,250
( Josuke gasps ) Okuyasu.

404
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,850
Shigechi: Huh? Oh, yeah.

405
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,920
i almost forgot
I gave you that little handout.

406
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,520
I felt so bad for you beta boys,

407
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,360
i decided
the only right thing to do

408
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,360
was bless you
with over 10,000 yen.

409
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,360
okuyasu: Here!
The money’s all yours.

410
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,030
Just have mercy on us,
o strong one!

411
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,370
- ( Shigechi chuckles )
- ( Josuke gasps )

412
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
( Okuyasu grunting )

413
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,010
Josuke: Way to use your brain.

414
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,470
You’re trying to lure him in

415
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,410
like catching a raccoon
with a bit of bait!

416
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,910
Once he closes the distance,
bam, you’ll let him have it.

417
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,080
Well, i’ve got your back, buddy.

418
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,620
Go for it, man.
Work your magic.

419
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,420
Shigechi: That’s a good boy.

420
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,050
I don’t know where this newfound
obedience is coming from,

421
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,290
but i’m glad
you know the pecking order.

422
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,030
( Giggling )

423
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,400
Eh? Something wonky’s going on.

424
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Hey, now, okuyasu,

425
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,570
it feels like you’re trying
to lure me in with cash

426
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,340
so you can
attack me with your stand.

427
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,410
But you wouldn’t do that,
would you, old pal?

428
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,910
Ahh! So you were
trying to trick me!

429
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,680
Did you think i’d honestly fall

430
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,650
for a harebrained scheme
as lame as that one?

431
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,420
you must think
i’m some kind of idiot.

432
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,520
Well, no pity for you.

433
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,120
Okuyasu: It’s not like
we needed it anyway.

434
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,590
Time’s run out for you,
little man.

435
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,630
i guess you were
too busy flapping your gums

436
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,530
like a dumb-ass
to realize that you walked

437
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,060
right into the hand’s
striking range!

438
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,630
I’ll claw away the air
and make it teleport,

439
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,170
forcing the ticket out
of your hands and back to us.

440
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,140
Josuke: This ticket is ours.

441
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,040
Shigechi: It belongs with you?

442
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,140
do you know
who you’re talking to?

443
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,210
( Chuckles ) Idiots.
You wasted your time,

444
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,710
’cause i’m about
to take it back.

445
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,950
Josuke: Incredible. You’re
even dumber than I thought.

446
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,380
Your chance of winning
just expired,

447
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,720
and you never saw it coming.

448
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,320
Shigechi: My money!

449
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,360
what do you think
you’re doing to that ticket?!

450
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,690
It’s worth five million yen,

451
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,590
and you’re ripping it up
like it’s trash!

452
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,730
Why would you do that?!
I don’t get you in the least!

453
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
What was the point in going
through all this hoopla

454
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,670
if you were just going
to rip it up when you

455
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,570
- finally got your way?!
- Josuke: Because of you.

456
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,970
I needed a surefire way to stop
you from attacking us again.

457
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,440
Since you can’t
restore the ticket

458
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,480
without my shining diamond,
giving up is your best bet.

459
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,050
the fight’s over.
Accept it, and stand down.

460
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,050
Shigechi: Oh, I get it now.
That’s what you’re doing.

461
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,980
Josuke: And off they go!

462
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,050
your victory’s
blowing away in the wind.

463
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,390
Shigechi: I take it all back!
I don’t get any of this!

464
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,120
Why would you throw away
five million yen?!

465
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,330
Have you lost your mind?!

466
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,730
Harvest, bring back
every last piece! Go!

467
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,730
♪

468
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,270
josuke: Holy shit,
you really don’t get it, do you?

469
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,270
Sending harvest on a fetch quest

470
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,770
was the final nail
in your coffin.

471
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,440
okuyasu:
Your last line of defense

472
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,740
is running through the city
looking for paper scraps,

473
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,580
so who’s gonna protect you
from these drunks, huh?

474
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:01,020
Shigechi: I think I get it now.

475
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,520
( Okuyasu panting )

476
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,260
( Chuckles ) We did it.

477
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,320
Josuke: Since I caught you
lying down on the job,

478
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,390
why don’t we try and
get in a bit of study time?

479
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,360
The scraps of paper
floating around town

480
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,230
are picked up by your harvest,
but after that,

481
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,500
who has the power
to put them back together? Hmm?

482
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,240
I need an answer.

483
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,310
Who can put the scraps back
together with shining diamond?

484
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,810
Shigechi: Y-you, josuke.

485
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,380
Josuke: "Josuke"?!

486
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,050
sounds to me like
you’re forgetting something!

487
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,610
Shigechi: Yes, Mr. Josuke, sir.

488
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,820
Josuke: Ah, now that’s
what I like to hear.

489
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,480
And i’m sure you know the name

490
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,220
of the person who recovered
that I.O.U. From you.

491
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,420
Well? Say his name, half pint.

492
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,660
Shigechi: It’s okuyasu...

493
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,190
- ( Okuyasu growls )
- Shigechi: The great!

494
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,230
josuke: Good.
That’s our special man.

495
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,500
So what do you say we change
subjects and do a little math?

496
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,470
How do we split five million
between three people?

497
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,070
And remember, everyone has to be
happy when all is said is done.

498
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,670
Shigechi: Well,
i’m fine with half.

499
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,580
josuke: Half, huh?!
Did I or did I not just tell you

500
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,140
there are three of us
to consider?

501
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,650
How are each of us
supposed to get

502
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,180
half of the winnings, shigechi?

503
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,380
Good thing we’re studying,

504
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,480
because your math
needs some work, dude!

505
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
( Shigechi stammering )

506
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,650
Both: Anyone home?!

507
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,760
Shigechi: Uh...

508
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,090
i guess i’ll
be okay with a third.

509
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,690
Huh?

510
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,430
Now that I think about it,

511
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,130
without your help, i’d still
be collecting old stamps.

512
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,370
Both: Hmm?

513
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,340
Shigechi: I was acting
like a spoiled brat.

514
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,810
We all found that lottery ticket
by working as a team.

515
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
If we hadn’t banded together,
we never would’ve pulled it off.

516
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,710
Wow, it’s starting
to make sense.

517
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,150
my greed kept me
from seeing the big picture.

518
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,820
Let’s split everything
fair and square

519
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,790
so we all get what we want.

520
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,750
( Both chuckle )

521
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,120
- Josuke: There we go!
- ( Okuyasu laughs )

522
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,630
Shigechi: I’ve never seen
so much money before!

523
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,860
Okuyasu: It’s five million yen!

524
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,400
Banker: If you’re
interested in a home

525
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,860
for your newly acquired wealth,

526
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,400
your funds would be very secure
at budogaoka bank.

527
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,630
Josuke: You bet
we’re interested!

528
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,330
Okuyasu: We finally did it!

529
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,900
It’s like i’m dreaming!

530
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,270
Shigechi: I have a question.
Didn’t we agree

531
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,610
to split the winnings
between the three of us?

532
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,240
- josuke: Huh?
- Shigechi: Hear me out.

533
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,540
In the interest of maintaining

534
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,250
a fair and just agreement
between us partners,

535
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,250
wouldn’t it be best to include
our stands in this deal?

536
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,650
I mean, fair is fair, after all.

537
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,860
And since harvest is made up
of about 500 mini-stands,

538
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,460
we should split the pot
500 to one to one.

539
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,400
- That’s not an issue, is it?
- ( Both growl )

540
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,730
Josuke: You’re unbelievable!

541
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,470
okuyasu: I thought
you’d learned your lesson,

542
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,730
but you just don’t know
when to stop haggling, do you?!

543
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,270
Shigechi: I was
only messing around!

544
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,200
A third is fine!

545
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,510
Narrator: For some,
that’s far too much money

546
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,540
for high schoolers to have,
but c’est la vie.

547
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,810
