00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,870
- ( All gasp )
- Koichi: No!

524
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,870
You’re joking.

525
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,840
( Overlapping chatter )

526
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,250
( Okuyasu groans )
Everyone’s goin’ home.

527
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,980
- There are so many.
- Josuke: Damn it,

528
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,320
but which one is he?

529
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,480
Which one of these guys
is yoshikage Kira?!

530
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,150
( Koichi growls )

531
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:28,820
Yoshikage Kira,
you gutless prick!

532
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,830
Come out here, and face us!

533
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,890
Jotaro: So he managed
to slip away.

534
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,300
With his new face,

535
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,500
he’ll have no reason
to fear or hide.

536
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,500
you can bet your ass
he’ll stay right here in morioh

537
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:57,320
and go on living
just as he always has.
