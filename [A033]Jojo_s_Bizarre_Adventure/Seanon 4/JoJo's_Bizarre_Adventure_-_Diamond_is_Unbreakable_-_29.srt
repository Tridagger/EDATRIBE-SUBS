yuya: Not at all.
I’ve never seen the guy before.

350
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,190
Couldn’t care less who he is.

351
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,390
( Josuke groans )

352

Yuya: Nice goin’, highway go go.

353
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,290
that’s just
what the doctor ordered.

354
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,030
Now if I can just get ahold

355
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
of a few more suckers
like this dude,

356
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,000
i’ll be able to make
a full recovery in no time.

357
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,270
Woman #1: Get up!

358
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,600
Woman #2: Didn’t you
hear her, buster?

359
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,140
Get your ass up,
and get out of here!

360
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,010
Yuya: The question is, did you
hear me?! Leave him alone!

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,280
Stop wasting your time
with that guy,

362
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,010
and give me some
of that sweet, sweet lovin’.

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,620
You didn’t forget about
li’l old hurt me, did you?

364
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,490
i need to take
the piss of a lifetime,

365
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,020
and i’m not sure how
much longer I can hold it in.

366
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,520
Woman #3: Ooh! Looks like it’s
time for me to get to work!

367
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,260
Woman #2: What do you
think you’re doing?

368
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,630
We all agreed to take turns!
It’s my turn to do it!

369
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,630
Woman #1: Hey, I haven’t
gotten to do it yet!

370
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,500
Yuya: It doesn’t matter
who does it, ladies.

371
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,170
Just bring out that piss bottle,
and give me a hand.

372
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,000
- Woman #2: Okay!
- ( Woman #1 groans )

373
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,140
Then i’ll be over here.

374

377
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,050

378

Akemi: Sure, but how did
you know it was rotten?

379

Yuya: What do you mean? I can
smell that thing over here.

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,550

it was rotten.

381

on the head. And what’s this?

393
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,180
someone in here
is getting really pissed off.

394
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,480
( Sniffs ) When agitated,
the body produces adrenaline,

395
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,750
and one of you girls

396
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,190
has discharged
quite the pungent secretion.

397
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,660
Are you the grumpy gertrude,
reiko, dear?

398
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,530
Reiko: No, it’s not me.
I’m as happy as a clam, baby.

399

Yoshie: We’re all just happy

400
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,530

your old self again, snuggums!

401
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,930
Akemi: Yeah, we’ve all been
waiting for this moment.

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000

if we wanted to right now.

tell the truth. ( Sniffs )

404
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,610
Somebody in this room
is downright furious.

405
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,210
I can smell it
loud and clear!

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,210
( Women gasp )

407
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,010
Yuya: You better not be fibbing.

408
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,610
One of you is about to pop,
so tell me who it is.

409

Josuke: It’s me.

410
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,420
Yuya: Eh? Huh?

411
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,220
Josuke: That full-bodied odor
you’re whiffing

412
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,620
is courtesy
of yours truly, you dick!

413
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,220
Yuya: That’s bullshit!

414
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,390
your body should be
a nutritional wasteland by now!

415
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,290
How in the hell
are you standing?

416
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,430
Josuke: It’s simple.

417

( Yuya gasps )

418

You were suckin’ down my I.V.
Like a malnourished vampire!

419

Josuke: Calm down.
It was just a taste.

420
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,470
Even so, it was enough
to perk me up a bit.

Rohan...

423
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,650
You’re holding him
captive in the tunnel,

424
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,480
but that’s about to end.

425
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,980

you’ve totally forgotten

427
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,250
that highway go go
has your scent!

428
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,120
Shining diamond: Dora!

429

430
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,560
Women: Yu, baby!

431
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,360
Josuke: I don’t wanna hear
a peep out of you three!

432
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,960
You can call me
josuke higashikata,

433
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,500
and my stand is known
as shining diamond.

434
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,570
i’m limited
to close-range attacks,

435
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,670
but I can assure you
my punching speed

436
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,040
is a lot faster than 60 k.M.H.

437
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,710
I’ve never measured,
but if i’m close enough,

438
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,940
i’m sure I can get
to about 300 k.M.H.

439
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,450
Yuya: You just
stay away from me!

440
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,050
I know by now you’ve heard

441
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,080
that my back
has been broken to pieces!

442
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,950
My arms and legs
are fractured, too!

443
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,290
I can’t even roll over
to scratch my ass!

444
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,690
Are you really gonna slap around

445
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,990
a feeble, bedridden
hospital patient?

446
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,230
- ( Josuke growls )
- ( Yuya chuckles )

447
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,090
All right, I admit it.
i was a jerk.

448
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,600
but if you let me go,
i’ll free the guy in the tunnel.

449
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,430
I think he’s still alive,

450
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,430
though it certainly wouldn’t
hurt to give him some nutrients.

451
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
- So do we have a deal or what?
- ( Josuke growls )

452
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,300
Yuya: Oh, come on, man.

453
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,470
You wouldn’t beat up
a poor invalid, would you?

454
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,410
I know you’re not that cowardly!

455
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,010
If you did, you couldn’t
call yourself a man!

456
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,950
women: Yeah!
So back off, you coward!

457
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,110
josuke: Damn.
Guess you got a point.

458
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,050
Beating the shit out
of an injured victim

459
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
would leave a real bad taste
in my mouth,

460
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,290
and it definitely
wouldn’t be manly.

461
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,560
It’s not right, you know?

462
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,090
Yuya: That’s what i’m saying!

463
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,630
Kicking the ass
of a tool like me

464
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,360
will haunt
your conscience forever.

465
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,630
Josuke: To prevent
that nightmare,

466
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,070

of fixing you up.

467

Yuya: Hmm? ( Gasps )

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,370

You can move.

You’re completely healed.

470

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,210

gotten a clean bill of health

wasting away
