1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,680
- Man: Koichi.
- Koichi: Huh?

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,750
Eh? Huh?

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,780
Man: I’m over here, koichi.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,320
( Koichi yelps )
R-Rohan kishibe!

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,190
Rohan: Now, now, you don’t
have to be so defensive.

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,860
My days of causing you harm
are long past.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,100
besides, after reading
your history with heaven’s door,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,530
I found myself filled with
a deep sense of respect for you.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
I’d go so far as to say
we’re two peas in a pod.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,140
Wouldn’t you agree? ( Chuckles )

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,710
( Koichi whimpers, chuckles )

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,870
Rohan: Now then, i’d like
to ask you a question if I may.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,780
You see, I used to call
this area around here my home

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,510
until I was four or so.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,280
I’ve spent the day trying
to find my old residence.

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,820
Nostalgia must have
gotten the better of me.

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,220
Recalling one’s childhood

18
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,350
is central
to a manga artist’s work.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,360
However, those memories
belong to a four-year-old,

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,530
- so they’re a little bit foggy.
- Koichi: Oh.

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,660
Rohan: That’s why
I need your help.

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,700
my question
concerns this town map.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,330
There’s something odd about it.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,730
look. This is
the soba shop arisugawa,

25
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,410
kisara drugstore,
and the owson convenience store.

26
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,270
They’re situated right to left.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,580
Koichi: Huh?

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,280
Rohan: Now take a look
at the shops themselves.

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,610
From the right,
you can see arisugawa,

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,080
kisara drugstore, and then...

31
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,550
- ( Koichi gasps )
- Rohan: You have owson

32
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,820
on the far left. See?

33
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,620
Koichi: Huh? That’s weird.

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,690
The map doesn’t show a road
between owson and the drugstore.

35
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,830
What sloppy work.

36
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,690
Rohan: Koichi,
would you tag along?

37
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,830
I would be forever in your debt
if you’d be my guide for a bit.

38
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,830
Koichi: Huh? Well, i’d like to,
but the thing is...

39
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,110
Rohan: That’s the response you
give after I ask so politely?

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,610
Fine. Have it your way.

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,440
I didn’t realize
showing me around

42
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,510
for a few meters
would be such a burden.

43
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,450
koichi: He sure
is self-centered. ( Sighs )

44
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,580
I can only spare five minutes.
Okay, sensei?

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,830
Rohan: Strange, isn’t it?
I’m checking my official

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,130
shoin press
ultra-detailed map of morioh,

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,500
and it makes no mention
of this street existing.

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,830
Koichi: On the bright side,
since your map had an error,

49
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,800
you might get a gift certificate
at the bookstore.

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,710
( Groans )

51
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Rohan: Blast it.

52
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,780
This map is absolutely useless.

53
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,580
Take a look, koichi.

54
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,720
It doesn’t show the yonemori,
honma, or onadera residence.

55
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,390
There are mistakes everywhere.

56
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,690
The bookstore’s going to owe me

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
more than two or three
gift certificates.

58
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,460
Koichi: Rohan-sensei, this place
looks like it’s been abandoned.

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,770
What a weird area.

60
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,600
The few houses
that are around here

61
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,870
- look completely unoccupied.
- Rohan: And look.

62
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,210
Even the vending machines
are out of order. Hmm?

63
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,480
Koichi: What the--
it’s the mailbox.

64
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,380
We made our first turn
at this corner

65
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,850
when we came down the alleyway.

66
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,520
This is too weird.

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,490
Somehow we’ve managed to end up
right back where we started.

68
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,660
Rohan: But we turned right,
left, then right.

69
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,230
( Swallows )

70
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,430
keep your guard up.
There could be an enemy nearby

71
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,300
manipulating things
with their stand.

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
( Koichi gasps ) You think?

73
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,730
Rohan: If you would,

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,100
have reverb fly overhead
and search the area.

75
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,730
( Koichi gasps )
Yeah, of course.

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,840
from up there,
it can see where we need to go.

77
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,570
Reverb act one.

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,180
( Reverb gasps )

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,450
Rohan: What’s the matter?

80
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,610
Koichi: There was
something up there.

81
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,580
I don’t know what, but something
just grazed reverb.

82
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,250
Rohan: Are you sure?
I didn’t see anything.

83
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
Koichi: I know something
came into contact with reverb.

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,790
Girl: ’scuse me.
Are you two lost?

85
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,830
( Koichi gasps )

86
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,830
Girl: I would be happy
to be your guide.

87
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,470
Rohan: A girl.

88
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,800
Koichi: She must be
the enemy stand user.

89
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,810
- Rohan: Heaven’s door!
- ( Girl gasps )

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,880
Rohan: And with the flick
of a finger, victory is mine.

91
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,050
We should be safe now.

92
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,450
I’ve written commands
in her pages,

93
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,350
so she won’t be able to harm us.

94
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,390
Koichi: Sensei,
that was amazing.

95
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,660
It’s like you launched
your drawing into midair.

96
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,490
I’ve made quite a lot
of progress with my stand.

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,330
That said, it still doesn’t work
on haters like josuke,

98
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,800
who wouldn’t know art
if it kicked him in groin.

99
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,670
she and I are
on the same wavelength.

100
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,310
oh, dear. She’s just
an ordinary girl, not an enemy.

101
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,540
koichi: Huh?
So she’s not out to get us?

102
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,180
Rohan: That’s right.

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,610
You can’t conceal anything
from heaven’s door.

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,080
Her name is reimi sugimoto,
age 16.

105
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,350
her address
is 312 kotodai, morioh.

106
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,720
That’s not far from here.

107
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,120
She has no boyfriend,
and her measurements

108
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,660
are 82, 57,
and 84 centimeters.

109
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,560
There’s a mole
by her left nipple,

110
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,330
and her first period came
at age 11 in September.

111
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,830
The first time she kissed a boy,

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,500
he rammed his tongue
down her throat.

113
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,500
Koichi: That’s just
about enough, Rohan!

114
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,540
If this girl’s not a stand user,
then I refuse to allow you

115
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
to read anything else
about her life!

116
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,610
Rohan: All right, all right.
I get it.

117
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,610
take it easy.
"I will forget everything

118
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,780
that has just happened." There.

119
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,450
Reimi: I’d be happy
to guide you.

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,180
Really, this place
trips a lot of people up.

121
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,290
Several of these alleys
look the same.

122
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,820
Rohan: Please point us
in the right direction,

123
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,260
and we’ll be on our way.

124
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,420
Reimi: Absolutely not.

125
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,830
A simple explanation
won’t cut it.

126
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,260
I’m your guide, so follow me.

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,560
- Rohan: Hmm.
- Koichi: Huh?

128
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,470
- Reimi: Want one?
- Both: Mm-mmm.

129
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,730
Reimi: If you’re sure.

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,370
but you still
have to hold on to the end.

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,540
Rohan: Hmm?

132
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,240
Reimi: Uh-oh. Better be careful.

133
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,280
Some girl is gonna dump you.

134
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,450
Rohan: Really?
Where’s your proof?

135
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,810
Reimi: Pocky fortunetelling.

136
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,520
The break tells me
all about you.

137
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,520
You’re majorly self-centered,

138
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,590
and you have a habit of pushing
people’s buttons, don’t you?

139
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,520
that’s why
you’re going to get dumped.

140
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,190
Rohan: Get a load
of this, koichi.

141
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,230
now we know
she’s off her rocker.

142
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,130
She actually thinks
i’m self-centered.

143
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,760
You’re about to find out
two can play at this game.

144
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,200
Light pink nail Polish
means you’re afraid of love.

145
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,530
That’s very telling.

146
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,640
you often let love
slip through your fingers.

147
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,540
( Reimi gasps )

148
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,210
No way.

149
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,480
Rohan: I use psychological
prodding over fortunetelling.

150
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
But enough about your love life.

151
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,210
something else
is weighing on your mind.

152
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,220
♪

153
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,360
Hmm?

154
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,460
Reimi: Have you heard
the story about this house?

155
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,800
It’s said it was the scene
of a murder 15 years ago.

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,230
Koichi: Did she say a murder?

157
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,500
Rohan: Yes, she did.

158
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,140
Reimi: No one lives
in the house now.

159
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,370
It’s empty. Here’s why.

160
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,780
This story was told to me
by the old lady next door.

161
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,080
it happened
in the dead of night,

162
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,120
while the young girl was
sleeping soundly in her bedroom.

163
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,590
she awoke
to a strange dripping sound

164
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,260
that seemed to be emanating
from her parents’s room,

165
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,720
but she couldn’t be sure.

166
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,720
( Koichi swallows )

167
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,590
Reimi: The sound puzzled her.

168
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,160
"Daddy," "mommy,"
she called out,

169
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,200
but she never heard a reply.

170
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,370
however, the girl
wasn’t particularly scared,

171
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,300
because she was accompanied

Rohan: Her dog?

173

reimi: Yes.
He was a big guard dog.

174
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,310
In the darkness, she’d offer
her hand to him under the bed,

175
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,410
and he’d always respond
with a whimper and a lick.

176
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,780
arnold was
her constant reassurance,

177
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,720
but the dripping
that had stolen the girl

178
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,390
from her peaceful slumber
continued for several minutes.

179
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,820
Finally, she’d had enough.

180
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,630
her curiosity
drove her to investigate.

181

Koichi: What happened next?
( Gulps )

182
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,070
Reimi: She found Arnold
with his throat slashed,

183
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,370
hanging from the coat rack
like an old pelt.

184
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,670
The dripping sound
was coming from him,

185
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,210
the sound
of his spilling blood.

186
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,510
( Both gasp )

187
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,210
Reimi: Suddenly,
she heard a voice

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,580
coming from under her bed.

189
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,780
"Your hand is so sweet
and tender, sweetheart.

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,320
"Whimper, whimper.

191
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,320
I’ve already murdered
your mommy and daddy."

192
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,320
And then he attacked the girl,

193
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,090
- killing her where she stood!
- ( Koichi screams )

194
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,290
Tell me that story was just
your way of joking around!

Sounded pretty real, didn’t it?

I was bound to this place.

the murderer,

before I got
a look at his face,

263

his knife
found its way into my back.

264
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,840
it was late and dark,
and I was doing my best to flee.

265

Rohan: Let’s back
this specter train up.

271
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,820
Why are you confessing
all this to us?

272

Reimi: Relax. I’m not
asking you to catch him.

273
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,560
i just need you
to tell someone who will.

274
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,830
You can tell the cops

275
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,170
or anybody else
you think is up to the task.

Why the hell should

277
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,700

fall on our shoulders?

I think it’s best
we remain levelheaded.

280
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,070
It’s an absolute tragedy.

281
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,010
I’m sorry your life
was stolen from you.

282
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
but that still
doesn’t explain things.

283
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,750
We find the murderer
so you can get closure?

284
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,580
That all seems rather pointless,
doesn’t it?

285
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,990
You’d be better off
letting go of this world.

286
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,820
Surely moving on
to the next world

287
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,920
would be a better existence
than haunting these alleyways.

do you have any idea

289
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,060
how many innocent boys and girls

Koichi: Wait a minute!
You can’t be serious!

299

This is still going on,
and no one’s done anything?!

300

Rohan: Hey! You can’t
just say things like that!

301
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,720
According to this story,
you didn’t even see his face.

302

How would you know
what’s going on?

303
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,960
Reimi: I know, because I see
the souls of his victims

304

dominating the skies!
It’s as clear as day!

305

are the same as mine!

Reimi: I can’t speak with those
traveling to the other side,

over and over.

one I know all too well.

313
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,610
Morioh has always been my home,

314
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,950
and for 15 years, it’s stood
in the shadow of murder.

315
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,550
It’s terrifying,

316
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,050
and on a personal level,
it’s utterly humiliating.

317
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,520
When they finally detain
that wild animal,

318
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,220
my cherished morioh
will have a new reputation.

319
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,230
All of Japan will know it
as the home of a monster.

320
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,060
But none of that
changes the fact

321
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,530
that we have to stop him
as fast as possible.

322
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,730
He’s preying on someone
as we speak,

323
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,170
and there’s nothing
at all I can do.

324

Whose life will be ripped away
from them next?

325

You still have blood
pumping through your veins.

326

If you won’t take back
morioh’s peace and dignity,

327
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,950
then tell me who will, and i’ll
ask for their help instead!

Although, this vicious killer

338
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,550
could be a good source
of inspiration.

339

for some interesting manga.

00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,490
Koichi: Don’t buy
the good-guy act.

343
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,260
It’s obvious that he
has ulterior motives.

344
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,860
And when it comes
to trustworthiness,

345
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,230
the guy’s shady at best.

346
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,600
( Rohan sighs )
Did you hear a word I just said?

347
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,070
Reimi: Then we’re agreed.

348
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,000
i’ll show you
how to get to the exit.

349
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,740
Koichi: Huh? The exit?
Where do we find it?!

350
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,110
Reimi: If you go
past the mailbox,

351
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,510
you’ll find it on the left.

352
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,250
- koichi: Yeah!
- Reimi: Hey, slow down!

353
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,950
trust me.
You don’t want to rush it.

354
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,250
There’s a rule
to making it through.

355
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,950
( Both stammer )

356
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,250
Rohan: There’s a rule?

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,220
Reimi: Yes. Once you
make it past the mailbox,

358
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,560
you’ll see the exit
about 20 meters away.

359
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,760
No matter what happens
around that corner,

360
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,100
I need you both to promise me
you’ll never look behind you.

361
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,730
Rohan: Why not?
What would be there?

362
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,970
Reimi: That’s just the rule
for passing to the next world.

363
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,640
Even Arnold understands
something as simple as that.

364
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,870
koichi: Okay.
If a dog can handle it,

365
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,480
I guess there’s no reason
I wouldn’t be able to.

366
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,850
Rohan: And if we do look back,
what happens then?

367
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,780
Reimi: Well, putting it
in layman’s terms,

368
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,250
your souls would be dragged
into the next world.

369
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,850
Put bluntly, you would die.

370
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,550
( Both gasp )

371
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,750
Reimi: But don’t worry.
It’ll be a piece of cake.

372
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,060
All you have to do is
look forward. Simple, right?

373
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,130
♪

374
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,200
( Rohan shudders )
Did you feel something, koichi?

375
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,000
koichi: Yeah.
When we passed the mailbox,

376
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,170
something flew past our legs
and went behind us.

377
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,010
Reimi: Remember, eyes front.

378
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,140
Just stay calm,
and you’ll be fine.

379
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,780
Koichi: You feel that,
rohan-sensei?

380
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,850
There’s some kind of ominous
presence creeping up behind us.

381
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,590
Rohan: Yes, i’m aware.

382

- ( Presence growls )
- ( Koichi gasps )

383
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,930
Something’s there.
I don’t know what,

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,800
but there’s something
right by my head.

385
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,530
Reimi: Just ignore it.

386
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,000
There will always be something
trying to make you look back.

387
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,040
I know it seems scary
and overwhelming,

388
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,810
but as long as you
don’t look back,

389
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,610
it can’t do anything
to cause you harm.

390
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,810
Koichi: There’s something warm
and runny oozing down my neck.

391
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,750
Ignoring this thing’s
gonna be a lot tougher

392
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,010
than you’re making it sound.

393
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,550
Reimi: Almost there.

394
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,720
Go through the light,
and you’re home free.

- Rohan: What?

396
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,490
Koichi: But I can’t
take any more of this,

397
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,720
and it’s so far away.

398
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,990
Let’s run for it, Rohan-sensei!

399
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,860
Reimi: Panicking
will make it worse!

400
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,530
It’ll try to trip you!

402
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,670
Reimi: You’re safe now.

403
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,200
You made it.

404
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,670
You can turn around now.
go ahead.

( Koichi panting )

406
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,240
I’ve never been so terrified.

Thank goodness it’s ov--

reimi: No, that wasn’t me!

409
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,250

Reimi: Koichi, if only
you had waited for us.

412
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,750
But this didn’t happen when I
came through here by myself.

413
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,020
Why’d they trick him?

414

- reimi: Koichi, no!
- Rohan: Huh. I don’t get it,

416
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,800
but if we don’t look,
we’re good to go, right?

417
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,800
You lucked out, koichi.
you’re with me.

418
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,170
Heaven’s door!

419
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,070
I’m taking your ability to see.

420
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,570
You’re welcome.

( Koichi gasping )

422
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,610
Rohan: You can
calm down, koichi.

423
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,620
I’ll reinscribe
your ability to see.

The alley between
the convenience store

426
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,090
and the drugstore,
it disappeared.

427
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,560
( Koichi sighs )
I’m just glad we’re back.

428
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,830
Reimi: I’m afraid
this is as far as we go.

( Both gasp )

430
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,570
Reimi: Well, at least
until he’s caught.

431
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,610
When that finally happens,
Arnold and I will look back,

432
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,080
and we’ll be reunited
with mom and dad.

433
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,910
Peace and dignity
must return to morioh.

434
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,280
only then
can we find eternal rest.

435
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,220
I’ll be right here if you ever
want to talk about anything.

You two don’t be
strangers, okay?

437

I’m here if you need me,
little Rohan, Mr. Koichi.

438

From the bottom of my heart,

439
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,130
I want to thank you
for listening to my story.

440
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,870
( Both sigh )

441
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,640
Rohan: She had some nerve.

442
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,210
Where does she get off
calling me "little Rohan"?

443
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,980
What an audacious ghost girl.

444
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,880
But, still, reimi sugimoto,

445
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,080
she has an unyielding spirit,

446
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,020
and that’s something
to be respected.

447
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,220
For 15 years, she’s waged
a fight for the living

448
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:35,790
with nothing but her courage
and trusted companion.

449
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,270
There it is. Reimi, age 16.

450
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,540
I never doubted her story,
but it’s nice to have evidence.

451

Monk: Ah, we have a visitor.

452
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,510
You wouldn’t happen to be
rohan kishibe,

453
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,910
the manga artist, would you?

454
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,610
Rohan: Uh, sorry.
Have we met before?

455
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,890
monk: Let’s see.
I’d say you would have been

456
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,720
about four when it happened.
It doesn’t surprise me

457
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,660
you have no recollection
of that night.

458
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,030
so i’ll start by saying
your house was close to theirs.

459
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,500
The night of the incident,

460
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,770
your parents
left home for the evening.

461
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,140
Apparently there was some urgent
business that needed attention.

462
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,570
Your parents and the sugimotos
were very close friends,

463
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,840
so they left you with them

464
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,480
while they handled
matters elsewhere.

465
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,480
( Rohan gasps )

00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,810
Monk: Rohan, that night,

467
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,820
the one that claimed the lives
of the sugimoto family,

468
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,090
you were there
and the only one rescued.

469
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,860
Rohan: I was there?

470
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,730
Monk: You were able
to survive that nightmare,

471
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,830
but once you were
in police custody,

472
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,200
you started crying
and repeating this sentence,

473
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,600
"big sis reimi snuck me
out the window and saved me."

474
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,900
Reimi risked everything
to get you to safety

475
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,270
before the murderer
could find you.

♪

477

Rohan: Now it all makes sense.

478
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,710
no wonder
she acted so familiar.

479
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,780
And I learned something else.

480
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,850
My heaven’s door,
it can’t reveal

481
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,620
my distant memories
or personal fate.

482
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,990

ever find yourself

wandering down this alleyway,
a word of warning.

485
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,660
You should never,
ever look back.

Koichi: I’m telling you,
I really met a ghost!

487
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,300
The girl you saw in that picture
is named reimi...

488
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,700
Josuke: Yeah, I get it.
i already said

489
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,370
that we believe you.
Right, okuyasu?

490
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,840
Koichi: She was also a student
at budogaoka high school.

491

Okuyasu: This cutie
is just my type.

492
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,240
If only i’d been born
15 years earlier.

493
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,780
Josuke: If she’s
gonna stick around,

494
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,250
we should probably meet
your ghost friend, too.

495
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,710
But fair warning, koichi.

496
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,450
if we go to jotaro
or Mr. Joseph about all this,

497
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,250
you can bet your ass they’ll
have one question for you.

498
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,460
"This unknown killer, is he
using a stand on his victims?"

499
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,190
Koichi: Uh, I guess
I really don’t know.

500
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,700
Josuke: Well, in that case,

501
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
it’s up to the police
and courts.

502
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,800
Koichi: What are you saying?!

503
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,630
There’s a bloodthirsty murderer
loose in morioh!

504
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,740
Josuke: Yeah, I know that,
and i’m telling you

505
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,940
that jotaro and
the speedwagon foundation

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,840
aren’t going after
an ordinary killer,

507
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,470
no matter how twisted he is.

508
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,310
Now take a deep breath.

509
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,450
He’s managed to avoid the police
for over a decade,
