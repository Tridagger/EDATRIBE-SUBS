the only passenger on board?

The rest of the crew members

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,490

the speedwagon foundation.

8

Even so, i’m sure chili pepper
will try to pass over the water

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,460
and sneak
onto the old man’s ship,

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,300
despite the fact
that he’s confined

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,300

23

30
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,200
is hiding
somewhere in this harbor,

31
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,500
watching our every move.
understand?

32
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,700
( Both gasp )

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,540

He’s laying low right now

34
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,140
and waiting for us
to do something

35
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,210
that’ll give away
the ship’s position...

36
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,650
And my gut’s telling me a boat
won’t be his hiding place.

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,750
All he needs to make it over
to the old man is a battery

38
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,150
and something faster
than a speedboat.

39
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,920
once he puts
those two things together,

40
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,720
he’ll use it
to send chili pepper

41
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,460
flying to the old man’s ship.

42
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,790
Koichi: Wait a second!

43
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,660
are you thinking
he’s gonna take to the sky?

44
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,830
jotaro: Yeah.
To be perfectly frank,

45
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,500
he’s probably making off

46
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,670
with a remote-controlled plane
as we speak.

47
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,300
Koichi: That thought
hadn’t even occurred to me!

48
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,840
But it’s possible.
Once they pick up speed,

49
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,310
model airplanes can fly
over 100 kilometers per hour,

50
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,310
faster than the motorboat’s
top speed!

51
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,580
And because chili pepper’ll
be in control of it,

52
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,610
he can fly the plane
as far and as high

53
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,680
as the battery will take him!

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,420
he doesn’t need
a remote-control’s signal!

55
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,590
Jotaro: Listen, josuke,
if you spot anything

56
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,190

to search for the user.

00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,820
josuke: I know stands
can move at incredible speeds,

176
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,220
but this is different.

177
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,260
It’s like he found a way
to teleport behind me.

178
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,290
Koichi: No, josuke,
that’s not what happened.

179
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,000
I was able to see everything
back there.

180
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,000
Otoishi didn’t take
a single step.

181
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,600
You’re the one
who changed position.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,870
- Something moved you!
- Josuke: Say what?

183
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,340
Koichi: Chili pepper
suddenly appeared

184
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,910
and flipped shining diamond
around 180 degrees

185
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,710
without you
even realizing it.

186
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,750
- ( Josuke gasps )
- Koichi: Just look.

187
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,350
You’re facing the ocean.

188
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,750
Josuke: Chili pepper did that?

189
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,920
Where is he now, koichi?

190
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,190
I don’t see that sparky bastard.

191
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,760
Koichi: He’s hiding underground.

192
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,130
He’s using the storm drains
to come and go!

193
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,030
He popped halfway out of
the drain to turn you around!

194
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,700
There must be underground
electrical lines

195
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,900
running all over the place!

196
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,300
Akira: A little soul-searching

197
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,240
always gives me the boost I need
to bring the pain.

198
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,100
Koichi: Behind you!
On your right!

199
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,940
- ( Josuke gasps )
- Shining diamond: Dora!

200
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,640
Dora!

201
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,810
Koichi: He’s right behind you!

202
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,780
( Shining diamond yells )

203
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,050
( Chili pepper laughs )

204
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,290
Koichi: He bolts back
into the electrical wires

205
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,890
at the last second,
and his speed

206
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,320
makes him hard to pin down!

207
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,630
Jotaro’s the only one
who can keep up with him.

208
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,730
What are we gonna do?!

209
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,130
Akira: Here in the harbor,

210
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,130
you don’t have the luxury
of digging up asphalt

211
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,770
and severing all the wires,
josuke higashikata.

212
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,700
However, the bigger the opening

213
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,970
you make in the ground
with shining diamond,

214
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,210
the easier it is
to surface from below

215
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,780
and knock your lights out!

216
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,980
Koichi: Josuke,
he’s on your right!

217
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,080
No, in front!

218
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,080
Behind you!

219
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,980
No, wait! He’s--

220
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,890
( gasping )

221
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,220
this is like a game
of whack-a-mole on steroids!

222
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,020
I can’t follow his movements at
all when he’s going that fast!

223
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,890
( Shining diamond yelling )

224
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,000
chili pepper:
What’s the matter, josuke?

225
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,930
Can’t keep your eye
on the birdie?!

226
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,970
- ( Koichi whimpering )
- ( Blows smacking )

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Josuke, no!

228
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,200
Akira: Well, look at that.
Two minutes to spare.

229
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,810
That gives me plenty of time
to finish this.

230
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
( Josuke panting )

231
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,880
Hey, koichi, keep track
of chili pepper’s location,

232
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,050
and call it out to me.
at this range,

233
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,380
he’s moving too fast
for my eyes to follow.

234
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,290
Koichi: But if you can’t follow
him, how am I supposed to?

235
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,190
As soon as I find him,
he disappears!

236
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,360
Josuke: Then you have
to look harder, koichi.

237
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,030
We’re about to win this,

238
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,760
and by now, you should know
what i’m thinking.

239
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,230
( Koichi gasps ) I should?

240
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,400
( Gasps )

241
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,370
That muck on the ground.

242
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,700
The asphalt’s turned into tar,

243
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,270
and the drains are covered
in all the oil from the tar.

244
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,940
i get it now.
When josuke struck the ground,

245
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,380
he reduced the asphalt
to its most basic ingredients,

246
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,780
which means...

247
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,790
Behind you, on the left!

248
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,390
( Shining diamond yelling )

249
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,060
( Akira groans )

250
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,790
Koichi: Oh, yeah!
Right in the kisser!

251
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,430
Josuke: Well, that’s great.

252
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,300
our strategy
worked like a charm.

253
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,230
Guess i’m the superstar now,

254
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,070
’cause i’m gonna rock
this loser’s world.

255
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,240
Okuyasu: Huh?

256
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,740
It’s the boat!

257
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,310
She’s dead ahead, jotaro!

258
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,010
See? We’re almost there!

259
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,440
Jotaro: Don’t drop
your guard yet.

260
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Okuyasu: Huh? Whoa!

261
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,350
What the hell’s
happenin’ over there?!

262
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,950
Josuke! Koichi!

263
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,750
♪

264
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,450
Koichi: What’s that light?

265
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,420
Akira: I underestimated you,
josuke higashikata.

266
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,790
I was too focused
on my presentation

267
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,830
and should have
just gone in for the kill.

268
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,230
But i’ve learned my lesson.
The juvenile me is no more.

269
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,440
i’m reborn
as a killing machine!

270
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,800
And for my first act of anarchy,

271
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,470
i’ll focus all of morioh’s
electricity into chili pepper.

272
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,310
chili pepper:
This is my last resort.

273
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,380
Using this technique
means temporarily

274
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,410
knocking out power
all over town,

275
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,820
which i’m forced to draw on
for my lifeblood!

276
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,850
But none of that matters now.

277
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,990
After i’ve done away
with you cretins,

278
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,290
i’ll bolt over
to the r.C. Plane’s battery!

279
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,060
Then i’ll fly over to Joseph
and slit his throat!

280
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,830
Koichi: What the--

281
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,930
I can’t see a thing!

282
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,200
( Josuke groans )

283
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,000
Bastard.

285
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,710
Ya-hah!

( Josuke gags )

287
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,110
( Koichi wails )
I don’t believe it!

288
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,350
chili pepper
got the best of josuke!

289
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,350
( Josuke gags )

290
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,320

( Josuke groans )

293
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,160
chili pepper:
Is it sinking in yet?

294
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,200
This entire town’s electrical
power is at my disposal.

295
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,170
Akira: And to really
drive the point home,

296
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,770
i’ll be sure to charge
my electric bill for the month

297
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,910
- to your address. ( Chuckles )
- ( Josuke growls )

298
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,240
chili pepper:
It’s lights out, josuke!

299
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,540
Huh? ( Grunting )

300
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,150
( Akira gasps )
Is that a tire?!

301
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,280
Josuke: Just as I expected,

302
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,090
you were too dense
to figure it out.

303
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,390
Akira: Huh?

304
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,860
Now I understand!

305
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,390
You blew up that tire
on purpose!

306
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,230
It was all part of your plan
to entomb my stand in rubber!

307
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,460
Koichi: Of course!
Rubber is an insulator,

308
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,300
so it doesn’t
conduct electricity!

309
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,270
chili pepper
is powerless in there!

310
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,340
Chili pepper: Damn it all!

311
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,940
Koichi: All right! We just
have to wait for jotaro now.

312
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,240
- Akira: Just kidding.
- koichi: Eh?

313
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,210
akira: A good idea,
but that’s not gonna work on me.

314
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,280
Hah! Your plan
might have succeeded

315
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,020
had the rubber
been a meter thick,

316
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,880
but this flimsy excuse
for a trap

317
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,220
doesn’t even register
as a threat.

318
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,390
So let me show you
some real power.

319
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,460
- Dumb-ass!
- ( Koichi gasps )

320
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,190
( Akira laughs )

321
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,890
You’ve lost this battle, josuke!

( Laughs )

323
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,160
Josuke: Just great.

324
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,000
you really are
as stupid as you look.

325
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,100
Having your stand
break through the tire

326
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,340
was the dumbest thing
you could have done.

327
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,570
- Chili pepper: Huh? ( Yells )
- Akira: Huh?!

328
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,880
Chili pepper: I forgot
about the air in the tire!

329
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,450
Koichi: The pressure release
launched him like a rocket!

330
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,620
Chili pepper: No, not the ocean!

331
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,850
Anything but the ocean!

332
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,590
Koichi: Oh, yeah, that’s right.

333
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,990
Salt water conducts electricity,
and in the ocean,

334
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,260
the electricity that powers him
will scatter in every direction.

335
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,400
chili pepper:
I’m sorry I tried to kill you!

336
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,070
Please, just get me
out of here!

337
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,630
josuke: Didn’t you
say something about getting rid

338
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,970
of your juvenile self
a while back?

339
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,370
Sorry. That’s impossible
for a lowlife like you.

340
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,840
( Chili pepper grunting )

341
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,420
I’m...dissolving.

342
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,980
Koichi: His stand’s
been completely diffused,

343
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,390
which means that Akira is...

344
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,350
( Sizzling )

345
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,200
Is--is he dead?

346
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,540
Reverb: Jotaro!

347
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,210
I have some great news.

didn’t kill him.
