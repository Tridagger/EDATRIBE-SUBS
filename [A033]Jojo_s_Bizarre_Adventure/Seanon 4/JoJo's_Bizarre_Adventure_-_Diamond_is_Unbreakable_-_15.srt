177
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,550
Koichi: Okuyasu!

178
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,760
Okuyasu: Hold it right there!

179
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Just keep looking
straight ahead, buddy.

180
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,730
You’d better not
try anything funny,

181
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,700
or i’ll crush you with my stand,
you doodling dipshit!

182
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,030
koichi: I don’t know how
you figured out I was in danger,

183
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,870
okuyasu, but thank goodness
you’re here!

184
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,670
You are the best!

185
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,670
Rohan: It appears
as though your friend

186
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,810
had a sudden epiphany, koichi.

187
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,510
I didn’t notice it before,

188
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,180
but that small cut on your hand
must have given away

189
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,710
the predicament
you’re currently in.

190
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,150
( Koichi gasps )

191
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,020
rohan: You probably
scratched yourself on something

192
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,750
while you were crawling.

193
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,020
Koichi: I was so focused
on escaping, I didn’t notice.

194
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,560
rohan: That is what
gave it away, right, okuyasu?

195
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,630
And your stand is the hand.

196
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,060
Also, you have
a bit of a complex

197
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,760
regarding your dead brother,
keicho,

198
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,030
and whenever you try
to make a difficult decision,

199
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,830
you wish your brother
was there to do it for you.

200
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,500
Isn’t that right?

201
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,000
( Okuyasu gasps ) Wha...

202
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,210
Who the hell told you all that?
Speak up, punk!

203
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,010
Hey, koichi, tell me everything
about this guy’s stand.

204
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,810
Koichi: Yeah! He’s able to--

205
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,680
I can’t do it.

206
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,090
I can’t say anything that’d
put Rohan at a disadvantage.

207
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,150
If you catch a glimpse of
even one panel, it’s all over.

208
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,690
I desperately wanna
tell you not to look.

209
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,490
Please, don’t look
at that manga.

210
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,760
Okuyasu: Hold it!

211
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,100
Didn’t I tell you
not to move a muscle?!

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,670
Rohan: Okuyasu, you were
of no concern to me at first,

213
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,570
but that changed the moment
you entered this house.

214
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,210
Now you’ll serve
as another of my muses.

215
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,840
- ( Koichi gasps )
- ( Okuyasu growls )

216
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,710
Bastard!

217
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,680
What the hell?

218
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,680
Koichi: He’s really fast.

219
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,590
( The hand screaming )

220
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,160
Koichi: Okuyasu!

221
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,230
Okuyasu: What going on?!

222
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,890
Rohan: Josuke higashikata,

223
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,860
I know you’re hiding over there.

224
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,200
( Okuyasu yelling )

225
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,540
Koichi: Okuyasu!

226
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,940
Okuyasu: What the hell is up

227
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,540
with this
freaky-ass manga artist?!

228
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,910
Rohan: Silence.

229
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,650
Now then, koichi,
if you don’t mind,

230
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,450
- I have a question.
- Koichi: Huh?

231
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,620
Rohan: Why do you think
josuke higashikata

232
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,050
is choosing to remain hidden
behind that door?

233
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,890
( Josuke gasps )

234
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,090
rohan: Hmm?
So what do you think?

235
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,490
why won’t he
show himself, koichi?

236
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,330
Koichi: Well, if I had to guess,
i’d say he’s laying low

237
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,000
so he won’t accidentally
catch a sight of your manga.

238
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,200
Rohan: My thoughts exactly.
How very astute of you.

239
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,000
Rohan: Okuyasu knew nothing

240
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,110
about the power
of my heaven’s door,

241
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,340
so he fell for my trap
hook, line, and sinker,

242
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,950
but in doing so, he exposed
the true nature of my stand

243
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,120
to josuke,
causing him to take cover.

244
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,120
I feel that I am somewhat--

245
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,550
no, at this point,

246
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,360
it would appear i’m
at a significant disadvantage.

247
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,920
However, I believe that josuke

248
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,590
has an ulterior motive
for choosing to remain hidden.

249
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,530
What do you think that is?

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,860
- ( Okuyasu gasps )
- Rohan: At any rate,

251
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,230
this game of cat and mouse
has gone on long enough.

252
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,340
I suppose i’ll have to resort
to other means

253
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,240
to smoke him out
of his hiding place.

254
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,340
Okuyasu: He’s only hiding,
’cause he wants to figure out

255
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,070
the best way to kick your ass!

256
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,940
( Rohan laughs ) You’re
probably right about that,

257
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,050
but that wasn’t the answer
I was looking for.

258
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,180
No matter, though.
I think i’ve got it.

259
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,290
Our dear hero josuke
is contemplating

260
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,260
whether he should flee
the mansion all by his lonesome.

261
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,390
Some friend, he is.

262
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,420
Koichi: You’re wrong!

263
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,930
Josuke would never
leave us behind!

264
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,990
- Rohan: Right you are, koichi.
- Koichi: Huh?

265
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,530
Rohan: According to your files,

266
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,270
josuke higashikata
has far too much character

267
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,940
to even think
about abandoning you two.

268
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,070
But due to the dynamic nature
of a manga artist’s work,

269
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,010
they tend to consider
every conceivable possibility

270
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,840
at every conceivable moment.

271
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,110
So, in the situation
we now find ourselves in,

272
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,080
what course of action will our
protagonist employ? Let’s see.

273
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,290
Perhaps josuke could flee with
knowledge of my stand’s power,

274
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,560
which would be
quite the dilemma for me.

275
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,360
Okuyasu: You know, running away

276
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,330
might be the best thing
he could do.

277
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,930
He could go and get jotaro,

278
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,000
and if he told yukako
what happened to you,

279
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,130
i’m sure she’d be
angry enough to help us out.

280
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,030
( Koichi yelps )
I’d rather not see her again,

281
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,400
but we could use her hair.

282
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,100
Okuyasu: Josuke,
get out of here,

283
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,970
and tell them what’s going on!
( Groans )

284
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,310
rohan: You imbeciles!
I explained all of that to you

285
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,040
exactly so it wouldn’t happen,

286
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,140
and I doubt you’d be
so quick to prompt josuke

287
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,410
if you knew
what was written in you!

288
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Koichi, i’m giving you
my express permission

289
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,350
to explain the content
of my missive. Let’s hear it.

290
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,150
( Koichi gasping )

291
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,120
Gah! There’s no way!
You can’t be serious!

292
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,930
Okuyasu: Hey, out with it.
What did he write, koichi?

293
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,000
Koichi: How could he do that?
It’s sick.

294
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,530
He’s completely trapped us
in this mansion.

295
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,930
It doesn’t matter what we do!

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,340
we’re never
getting out of here!

297
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,900
( Okuyasu growls )
That’s why i’m asking

298
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,270
what the hell this sicko
wrote on my arm, koichi!

299
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,910
Burn myself to death?!

300
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,180
Koichi: That’s why I said
we’re never getting out of here!

301
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,420
You’ll kill yourself if josuke

302
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,290
so much as lifts a finger
to help us!

303
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,290
( Josuke gasps )

304
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,350
( Okuyasu growls )

305
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,920
Hey, wait a second.

306
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,860
he thinks
i’ll burn myself to death?

307
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,190
( Laughs )
That’s total crazy talk.

308
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,430
As if i’d ever do something as
messed up as setting myself on--

309
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,600
hmm?

310
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,470
Koichi: That’s just it!
you will!

311
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,070
We’re completely incapable
of defying him!

312
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,070
Okuyasu: Come on, right hand!
Knock it off! This is so wrong!

313
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,070
( Screams )

314
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,440
( Josuke gasps )

315
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,080
Rohan: So you’ve come out.

316
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,510
Koichi: Like he
really had a choice!

317
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,480
He was basically
dragged out here,

318
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,020
because he couldn’t bear
to hear us suffer!

319
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,820
rohan: Oh.
That’s a rather childish move,

320
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,160
but closing your eyes
could be effective.

321
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,160
There’s nowhere to run
in this cramped room.

322
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,590
If he managed to knock me out,

323
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,190
heaven’s door
would release its grip,

324
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,360
and okuyasu
wouldn’t commit suicide.

325
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,360
( Okuyasu screaming )

326
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,570
Koichi: Josuke, help!

327
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,470
♪

328
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,170
Closing his eyes
is simple-minded,

329
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,510
but it just might work.

330
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,440
As long as he doesn’t see
the manuscript,

331
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,480
heaven’s door is powerless.
Come on. Keep charging.

332
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,580
Rohan: Eh, a pretty good plan,

333
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,350
but all I have to do now is find
a way to force your eyes open.

334
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Think fast!

335
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,320
( Josuke grunts )

336
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,920
rohan: What’s this?
He’s powering through the pain.

337
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,290
If he keeps charging at me
like a stampeding bull,

338
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,330
things are
going to get very ugly.

339
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,030
If I were a manga protagonist,

340
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,130
what would I do
in this situation?

341
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,130
How would I get my enemy
to open his eyes?

342
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,140
Koichi: Keep going, josuke!

343

For pete’s sake, hurry up!
