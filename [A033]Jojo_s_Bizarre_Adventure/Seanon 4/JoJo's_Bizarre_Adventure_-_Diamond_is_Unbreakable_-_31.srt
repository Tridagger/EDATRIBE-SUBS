Okuyasu: This thing
looks a lot bigger

175
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,460
once you get up close to it.

176
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,160
Man: If you fellas
know what’s good for you,

177
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,030
you’ll stop right there
and won’t get any closer!

178
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,340
didn’t you two
hear what I said? Get back!

179
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,170
I just answered
the call of nature,

180
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,710
and, trust me, you don’t wanna
be there to get the message.

181

182
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,240
Josuke: I’m really
not following.

184
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,210
- This is disgusting!
- ( Both yell )

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,180
Man: Don’t say
I didn’t warn you.

186
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,020
i needed
to fertilize the garden.

187
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,420
Josuke: Guh! That’s so gross!

188
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,220
Man: Watch your mouth!
That’s impolite!

189
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,360
I designed this nifty
contraption so it would

190
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,560
distribute the fertilizer
to all the plants below!

191
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,430
I’m all about that zero-waste
lifestyle, you know.

192
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,700
on the right
are asiatic dayflowers,

193
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,170
mountain asparagus,
and watercress.

194
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,240
They’re all completely edible!

195
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,240
and with all
of these plants around,

196
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,240
catching nibbling rabbits
is a cinch,

197
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,040
so i’ve got the best
of both worlds, baby!

198
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,310
Josuke: No way! So you’re really
living up there all alone?

199
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:28,120
Doesn’t this tower belong
to some electric company?

200
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,650
Man: What are you talking about?

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,520
I paid for this house with
my own money. It’s all mine.

202
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,490
I bought this abandoned tower
for 100,000 yen

203
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,290
and transformed it into
my self-sufficient dream house.

204
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,460
Okuyasu: You bought it?

205
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,030
Josuke: For 100,000 yen?

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,630
Man: Yes, that’s right.
it was a steal.

207
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,170
Since I support myself,

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
i’m not stuck working
for some lame company.

209
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,210
It’s a pretty sweet life,
if you think about it.

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,570
I don’t have to leave the house,

211
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,580
and I get all the exercise
I could ever need. Heh.

212
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,610
I mean, do you see this view?
It’s spectacular.

Run that by me again.

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,280
You don’t even have to leave?

215
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,550
Just how long have you
been living up there, anyway?

216

for about three years now.

dumb enough to attack us.

Josuke: You’re right.
For now, at least,

226

327

Okuyasu: This thing’s
pretty frickin’ solid,

350
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,390
but if we keep pounding it
like we have been,

351
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,760

and fall over in no time.

straight to using your fists.

the power of your attacks

over its entire structure.

hearing is the sound

368
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,370

left over from your punches

369
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400

throughout the whole tower.

370
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,670
Josuke: What?

371
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,870
Toyohiro: Mind if I ask
you boys a question?

372
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,010
Have either of you ever heard
of the law of conservation?

373
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,780
Once energy has been collected,

374
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,510
it’ll eventually be released
for use in a different form,

375
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,680

where it’s gonna go now.

376

are putting out

382

is just going
to go around and around

383
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,340
and come right back
to bite you in the ass.

384
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,440
so go ahead!
You’re only hurting yourselves!

385
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,580
Why not save the money
in hospital bills

386
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:10,450

that you’re outmatched?

387

how strong you are.

to dodge it.

left a hole in my side.

warned you about that, huh?

drop dead, that would never

All you have to do is find
someone else to take your place.

and one comes out.
