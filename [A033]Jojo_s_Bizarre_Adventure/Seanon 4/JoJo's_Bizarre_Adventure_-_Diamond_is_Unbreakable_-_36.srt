00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,340
and i’m still kinda groggy
from oversleeping.

180
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,470
Okuyasu: I know i’ve seen
this kid’s face before,

181
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,570
but, for the life of me,
I can’t remember where.

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,570
( Hayato gasps )

183
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,710
Koichi: Hey, look.
It’s josuke and okuyasu.

184
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
- Josuke: What’s up, bro?
- Okuyasu: Yo, koichi.

185
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,680
Hope your morning’s
been spiffy, jotaro.

186
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,780
Josuke: So we’re
still waiting...

187
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,650
Hayato: Th-there
are two more of them.

188
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,420
Kira told me that others
would eventually be showing up.

189
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,320
He was talking about them!

190
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,360
Josuke: ...Kid’s house
without Rohan helping us out?

191
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,690
Uh, sorry.

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,360
I nearly forgot I was
still hanging on to this.

193
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,530
I believe this is yours.

194
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,570
Hayato: Oh, thanks a lot.

195
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,570
Koichi: You know,
it might be the angle.

196
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,470
Oh, yeah, i’m sure of it.

197
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,180
I know i’ve seen
that face before.

198
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,510
I don’t know from where,

199
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,180
but he looks too familiar
to be a stranger.

200
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,780
Jotaro: Koichi, look
at the name on his backpack.

201
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,190
Koichi: Huh? Hayato kawajiri?!

202
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,790
Josuke and okuyasu: What?!

203
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,660
Hayato: Crap,
they figured me out!

204
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,230
( Hayato gasping )

205
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,970
Jotaro: Hayato kawajiri.

206
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,070
Okuyasu: What the hell
are you doing here?

207
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,270
- Josuke: Was all this planned?
- Koichi: Wait.

208
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,040
Could this have something
to do with Rohan-sensei?

209
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,110
( Hayato gasps )
What am I supposed to do now?

210
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,710
If these guys start questioning
me about my dad, it’s all over.

211
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,020
The bomb will kill
every one of them!

212
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,250
No, please don’t ask me
any questions.

213
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,220
If you guys
end up getting killed

214
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,290
who’s gonna get rid
of the murderer?

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,060
If I have to dupe them,
then so be it.

216
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,730
Whatever it takes,
I can’t let them die!

217
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,200
Jotaro: I’d like to ask you
about this photo.

218
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,600
To be more precise,

219
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,210
I want to know the reason
behind your video recording.

220
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,710
Be straight with me.

221
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,810
- Why were you--
- ( Hayato wails )

222
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,610
Shoot! Nosebleed! Oh, no!

223
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,810
I don’t know why my nose
started bleeding out of nowhere,

224
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,150
but I have to find a doctor!

225
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,150
- Sorry!
- Josuke: Hold it.

226
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,660
You said you got a nosebleed,
huh? Let’s see it.

227
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,860
Come on. Let me see.

228
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,060
( Hayato groans )

229
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,860
It’s bad. I need a doctor.

230
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,600
Josuke: Nah, I don’t think
it’s that bad.

231
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,170
- Hayato: Huh?
- Josuke: See?

232
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,170
- It’s not even bleeding.
- Hayato: Huh?

233
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,970
( Josuke chuckles )

234
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,110
Josuke higashikata.
Nice to meet you.

235
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,210
That’s jotaro kujo,
one of my relatives.

236
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,050
Derp-face over there
is okuyasu nijimura,

237
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,990
and that’s koichi hirose,
the nicest guy I know.

238
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,620
You go to budogaoka elementary,

239
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,990
so you’ve got some time
before class starts.

240
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,990
We won’t take up
much of your time.

241
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,990
- Now, about this picture...
- ( Hayato gasps )

242
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,030
Josuke: If it’s nothing,
we’ll just be on our way.

243
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,600
Hayato: It is something,

244
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,970
but I can’t answer
any of your questions!

245
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Please don’t ask!

246
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,740
Josuke: You see
the man you’re filming?

247
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,670
Would he happen to be your--

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,040
hayato: I’m begging you!
Don’t say anything else!

249
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,850
( All gasp )

250
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,850
Hayato: Crap. What have I done?

251
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,320
Now they’re going to ask
even more questions.

252
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,890
Josuke: What do you mean,
"don’t say anything else"?

253
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,260
Hayato: They’re not gonna stop.

254
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,060
Jotaro: Just what is it
that we shouldn’t say?

255
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,630
Hayato:
There’s nothing I can do!

256
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,800
Koichi: Does all of this
have to do with your dad?

257
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,570
Hayato: The bomb’s gonna go off!
It’s gonna kill them all!

258
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,130
( Crying )

259
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,970
Koichi: What the hell’s
going on, huh?

260
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Josuke: Why can’t
we say anything else?

261
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,870
Okuyasu: Yeah. I mean,

262
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,310
we haven’t even
asked him anything yet.

263
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,980
- Jotaro: Given his reaction...
- ( Hayato muttering )

264
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,550
Jotaro: It seems the mere act
of us questioning the kid

265
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,080
is what’s sending him
into a panic.

266
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,220
Koichi: That’s it.

267
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,590
I have no other choice.

268
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,190
If I die here,
they’ll still be able to live!

269
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,790
I’m the bomb, so I have to die!

270
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,890
With me out of the picture,

271
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,760
I know these guys
will figure out

272
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,100
a way to defeat that devil
and save mom!

273
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,970
- ( Gasps )
- ( Crunch )

274
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,900
Josuke: It shouldn’t
be this difficult.

275
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,040
Let’s just ask him
about kosaku kawajiri already.

276
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,110
Jotaro: Hold on, josuke.
Something is up with him.

277
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,080
Boys: Huh?

278
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,880
Jotaro: Hey, what’s wrong?

279
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:54,980
Hey!

280
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,850
( Hayato gasping )

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,820
( All gasp )

282
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,960
Hayato: No, I can’t do it!

283
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,290
Something’s keeping me
from slashing my throat!

284
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,890
- Jotaro: Wait! What?!
- Josuke: Isn’t that kira’s?!

285
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Okuyasu: Yeah, it is!
That’s a face i’d never forget!

286
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,560
Koichi: It’s deadly queen!

287
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,570
( Star platinum yells )

288
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,570
Kira: Actually,
you’re looking at deadly queen’s

289
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,570
bomb type three, bites the dust.

290
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,840
To attack me now
would be futile.

291
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,880
In fact, the only reason
you can see me

292
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,550
is because i’ve already
entered your pupils.

293
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,880
- ( Josuke gasps )
- Kira: It doesn’t matter

294
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,550
how many of you
have gathered together.

295
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,950
The moment you asked
about my true identity,

296
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,320
your fate was sealed!

297
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,760
( Trigger clicks )

298
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,800
( Hayato screaming )

299
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,210
( Screams )

300
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,880
Shinobu: Oh, hayato.
I guess you’re already awake.

301
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,340
I’m glad you finally decided
to answer me,

302
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,210
but there’s no need to scream
this early in the morning.

303
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
Breakfast is ready.
Come and get it.

304
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,620
( Door closes )

305
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,190
( Hayato crying )

306
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,290
I tried,
but I couldn’t stop him.

307
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,230
He got them, too.

308
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,730
It doesn’t matter what I do now.

309
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,900
In one hour,
fate will run its course,

310
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,100
and Rohan and his friends

311
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,040
will be wiped
off the face of the earth.

312
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,840
It’s over. It’s all my fault.

313
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,970
I can’t even kill myself.

314
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,740
If I died, he wouldn’t
be able to use his power,

315
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,910
but bites the dust
is programmed to protect me.

316
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,320
He’s unstoppable!

317
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,720
Yoshikage Kira is a monster!

318
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,020
Unless he dies
or decides to shut off

319
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,290
bites the dust
at just the right time,

320
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,990
those guys are
gonna be blown sky high.

321
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,860
He’s made sure of it.

322
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,540
( Sighs )

323
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,110
♪

324
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,680
He either has to die,

325
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,980
or shut off bites the dust
at just the right moment.

326
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,850
It’s crazy. I never
thought i’d ever be capable

327
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,120
of something like killing
a person in cold blood.

328
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,530
I mean, i’m a puny
11-year-old kid.

329
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,200
What could I do
against a monster like him?

330
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,570
A-a monster.

331
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,830
That’s it! 11 years old or not,

332
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,100
there’s one thing I can use
to take him down for good.

333
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,640
Kira called me
his secret weapon earlier.

334
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,810
Well, i’ve got my own weapon,

335
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,880
and it’s slumbering
in the shadows of the attic.

336
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,890
I’ve never prayed before,
but, if there’s a god out there,

337
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,220
I need you
to come through for me.

338
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,020
Please, god,
help me find the strength

339
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,760
to kill this homicidal maniac.

340
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,700
- ( Gasps )
- ( Feral cat meows )

341
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,200
( Hayato gasps )

342
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,570
- ( Feral cat growling )
- Hayato: So I was right.

343
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,080
The sun makes
this cat plant spring to life.

344
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,640
Then it attacks its target

345
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,650
by shooting bullets
of compressed air.

346
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,250
It’s incredible

do it inside or nearby.

as a weapon to take him out?

Is that why he’s deciding
to keep his distance?

No way. If he knew,
he wouldn’t be that close.

one shot to finish him off,
