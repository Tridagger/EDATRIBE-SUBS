00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,380
Eh?

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,380
Ken: ’scuse me!
I wanna buy this book!

179
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,150
Rohan: You obnoxious little...

180
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,620
( Stammers )

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,620
Ken: Let’s Duke it out,
roshambo style.

182
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,350
Rohan: Fine.

183
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,560
Ken: Brace yourself!

184
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,560
Ro-sham...

185
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,930
Rohan: Rock!

186
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,060
you’re messing
with the wrong artist, punk!

187
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,930
( Ken laughs )

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,870
Look at that. I won.

189
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,840
Still think i’m just a punk?

190
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,870
( Laughs )

191
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,840
One win, two losses.

192
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,840
Rohan: What the hell
is going on here?

193
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,910
( Gasps )

194
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,050
( Gasps ) What is this?

195
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,520
What the--

196
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,520
it’s that damn cheek hole.

197
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,720
So I wasn’t off base before!
He might be a user!

198
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,620
What?!

199
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,630
Ken: This is frickin’ awesome!

200
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,630
I never would have guessed
he was hiding something so cool!

201
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,670
I’ve never felt anything
like the energy

202
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,370
flowing into me right now!
It’s totally awesome!

203
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,070
It’s like being supercharged!

204
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,570
Rohan: That’s enough!
Now quickly, heaven’s door,

205
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,110
turn this little brat
into a book!

206
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,550
( Groans )

207
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,680
( Pole clangs )

208
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,690
Judging from his sloppy work,

209
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,020
that must’ve been the first time
he’s used his stand.

210
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,930
However, that doesn’t mean
he won’t master it given time.

211
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,090
Eh? Heh.

212
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,970
"I want to beat the crap
out of Rohan in roshambo," huh?

213
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,930
"Roshambo isn’t
a game of chance.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,670
"It’s a psychological
game of will.

215
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,640
"If I beat Rohan at roshambo,
it means i’ve outwilled him.

216
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,410
"Rohan’s only 20 years old,

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,640
"but he lives life
on his own terms.

218
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,780
"His work also inspires
a whole lot of people.

219
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,480
"If I can beat the crap
out of Rohan in roshambo,

220
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,990
"that’ll prove I can be
better than him one day.

221
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,990
"I can’t wait to grow up,
’cause then i’ll be

222
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,760
just as respected
as the great Rohan." ( Gasps )

223
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,660
I knew it!

224
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,870
This kid is well on the road
to becoming a stand user.

225
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,970
The arrow must have
just pierced his soul.

226
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,140
"Ability-- winning in roshambo

227
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,410
"makes my opponent’s energy
my own,

228
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,510
"but I must play five games.

229
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,010
winning two games
only gives me partial energy."

230
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,980
So he needs to win five.

231
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,080
Huh?

232
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,690
It can’t be. How did you...

233
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Ken: So this power’s
called a stand.

234
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,690
That’s pretty awesome.

235
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,160
thought you dodged
a bullet there, didn’t you?

236
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,900
Well, think again,
’cause i’ve already

237
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,830
got a third
of your so-called stand.

238
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,000
( Rohan gasps )

239
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,600
What?! My right arm is gone!

240
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,000
Ken: It sure is,

241
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,010
and 1/3 of its incredible power
is under my control!

242
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:37,480
That means you can’t poke around
in my head anymore.

243
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,680
Rohan: Damn you!

244
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,080
Ken: Oh, and if I win
two more times,

245
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,180
all of your powers will be mine!

246
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,090
Rohan: You punk! Damn it.

247
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,090
You won’t get away with this!

248
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,460
Ken: Taking a swing at me
like that was pretty ballsy.

249
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,960
Guess you got a taste
of your own medicine.

250
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,860
Rohan: Okay. Now I get it.

251
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,700
i have to defeat you
in another game of roshambo.

252
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,700
That’s the only way i’ll
win back my stand’s right arm.

253
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,140
Game on!

254
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,670
Ken: Here we go!

255
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,680
Completely oblivious

256
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,080
to the plight you’re in?

257
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,550
If you lose just one more time,
you’re finished.

258
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,050
Surely, by now, you’ve realized
you’re all out of chances.

259
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,020
since I know
you’re a stand user,

260
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,820
i’ll show you no mercy.

261
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,720
the moment
I retrieve my right arm,

262
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,130
i’m putting you
out of commission.

263
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,560
Admit defeat.

264
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,660
Ken: Wait. Are you
trying to psyche me out?

265
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,070
Rohan: All right,
let’s get this started.

266
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,570
Ken: I’m not ready
to play just yet.

267
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,700
I won the last match
using paper,

268
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,240
so I guess it’s only natural

269
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,640
to wanna go with rock
or scissors this time,

270
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,680
but it’d be kinda stupid to go
with the obvious, just ’cause--

271
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,680
and it’s pretty clear
to anyone with eyes

272
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,050
you’re not the naïve type,
Rohan-sensei,

273
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,720
so maybe going with paper
would be the best way to go.

274
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,920
I mean, what could
it hurt, right?

275
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,620
Okay, i’ve made up my mind!

276
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,660
Let’s go!

277
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,190
Ro-sham...bo!

278
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,230
- Rohan: What?!
- Ken: I did it!

279
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,100
I outwilled Rohan-sensei
with the power of paper!

280
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,300
( Rohan groans )

281
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,570
ken: That makes
two wins and two losses.

282
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,270
Sucks for you. ( Chuckles )

283
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,210
( Rohan gasps )

284
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,570
♪

285
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,650
( Rohan panting )

286
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,320
( Ken laughs )

287
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,120
I just took the lower half
of your heaven’s door.

288
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,960
If you’re tired, you could
rest on that bench over there.

289
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,290
rohan: No,
that won’t be necessary.

290
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,760
When vanquishing your opponent,
you must savor it

291
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,100
and look down on the conquered
with pity and disdain.

292
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,270
( Ken chuckles )

293
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,270
I’ve got two wins
and two losses,

294
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,010
so we’re both
one game away from destiny,

295
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,650
but i’m so close to victory,
I can almost taste it!

296
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,320
I know I lost twice, but I came
back and won twice in a row.

297
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,920
It’s the other way around
for you. You’ve lost twice.

298
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,920
You’re smack-dab in the middle
of a major losing streak!

299
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,920
( Rohan growls )

300
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,030
( Yoshihiro laughs )

301
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,230
Marvelous!

302
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,970
As expected from one
chosen by the arrow.

303
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,770
We’re almost there.
If this kid can finish

304
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,770
absorbing Rohan kishibe’s
mind-reading powers,

305
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,040
we’ll be unstoppable!

306
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,640
you’ll serve
my precious yoshikage well.

307
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,810
Rohan: Good work. You’ve gotten
better at the mind games.

308
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,750
Quite impressive for a punk kid.

309
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,280
Ken: You’ve lost the game
twice in a row. That’s a fact.

310
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,590
Rohan: Yes, you’re right.
i won’t argue.

311
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,020
Since you’re big on facts,

312
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,830
I take it you won’t mind
if I tell you another?

313
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,300
I’m positive you won’t be
using paper for this duel.

314
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,760
( Ken gasps )

315
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,130
( Chuckles )
Guess we’ll find out, huh?

316
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,870
Rohan: Let’s not get ahead of
ourselves. I’m not finished yet.

317
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,870
I went with rock twice,
and it cost me both times.

318
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,240
It’s obvious now that rock
is my unlucky play. Am I wrong?

319
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,180
- ( Ken grunts )
- Rohan: It goes without saying

320
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,710
i’d be adverse to using rock
again when it’s been so unkind,

321
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,220
and since I won’t be going
with rock this time,

322
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,190
you won’t be able to use paper.

323
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,790
Using it would be the same

324
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,820
as admitting
i’m not on a losing streak,

325
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,660
despite what you said
a while back.

326
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,060
ken: Hah!
You’re still gonna lose!

327
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,960
All right! Let’s do this!

328
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,870
It’s time!

329
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,170
- ro...
- Rohan: Sham...

330
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,200
Both: Bo!

331
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,170
( Ken screams )

332
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,770
Rohan: All that bluffing,
and he still used paper.

333
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,140
What mental fortitude!

334
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,310
Ken: There’s no way
i’m gonna lose to him.

335
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
I still have the upper hand
in this match!

336
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,850
I’ll use paper
four times in a row!

337
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,120
This game’s in the bag!

338
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,980
Rohan: Time to go back to rock.

339
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,120
I’ll make misfortune
work in my favor.

340
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,650
Ken: Here we go!

341
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,930
( Rohan groans )
Wh-what’s wrong with my knees?

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,330
Ken: Huh? He’s never
moved like that before.

343
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,170
the only move Rohan
hasn’t used yet is scissors.

344
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,910
Crap! Going with paper
four times in a row is risky!

345
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,570
What?! No way!

346
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,680
Rohan: It seems rock
wasn’t unlucky after all.

347
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,680
