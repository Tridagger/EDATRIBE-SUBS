184

and dad’s business went under.

185

he was buried under a mountain of debt.

186

187

188

193

there were jewels and precious metals,

194

196

197

My father had made a dark deal.

198
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,750
he sold his own soul to a man by the name of dio.

199
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:36,020
He became dio’s lackey for monetary gain.

202

dio’s goal was to scour the globe

203
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,660
in search of potential stand users,

204
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,200
and somehow he discovered

205
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,040
my dad had the capacity to manifest a stand.

206
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,070

207

208

209

It’s been ten years, but I remember it like yesterday.

210
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,650

211

230

231

242
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,930
in my studies, I learned of enyaba the hag

243
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,060
and obtained possession of the bow and arrow.

245

that dad would never recover from the curse that plagued him.

246
