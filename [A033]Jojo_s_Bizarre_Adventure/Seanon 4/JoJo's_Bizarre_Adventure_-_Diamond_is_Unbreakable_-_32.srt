00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,520
Toyohiro: How the hell
can you be so nonchalant?

175
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,490
Josuke: Four of them, huh?
Well, that should be plenty.

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,130
I only need four shots
to take you down.

177
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,060
Toyohiro: What are you
blathering on about?

178
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,600
Josuke: If i’m
remembering right,

179
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,270
you used the word "ricochet."

180
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,270
yeah, that’s right.
You said your stand’s energy

181
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,500
ricocheted around
like billiard balls.

182
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,570
well, that is
what you said, isn’t it?

183
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,340
that’s right!
What are you gonna do about it?!

184
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,080
Josuke: By now,
you know my stand

185
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,310
is called shining diamond,

186
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,810
but did the old fart
in the photo

187
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,810
let you in on the fact
that it can correct

188
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,750
destroyed matter
and fractured energy?

189
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,650
Toyohiro: Maybe he did,
maybe he didn’t,

190
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,350
but what’s that got to do
with your current predicament?

191
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,220
Are you really telling me
you had the time

192
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,590
to correct something just now?

193
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,160
What kind of fool
do you take me for?!

194
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,260
( Groans )

195
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,560
mikitaka:
He corrected the energy

196
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,070
ricocheting between the beams

197
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,830
so that it would return
to the slashed steel.

198
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,740
Mr. Josuke, I thought
that you were done for,

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,640
but you had already won
this battle.

200
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,640
toyohiro:
How’d you pull that off?

201
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,140
josuke: You said
coming up here was a dumb move.

202
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,780
What do you think
of my plan now?

203
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,750
( Toyohiro screams )

204
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,220
Please forgive me.
The whole reason

205
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,220
i started living
in this godforsaken tower

206
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,130
was to get away
from other people.

207
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,430
But that cranky, old grand-dude
in the photograph

208
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,360
convinced me
to trap a stand user.

209
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,070
He said if I could just do that,

210
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,070
he’d make sure
i’d be able to have a life

211
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,540
in the outside world,
so I decided to go for it.

212
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,040
Please, go easy on me!
I’m begging you!

213
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,480
If you’d let me go back
inside the safety of my tower,

214
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,150
i’ll be a good boy!
I never wanna leave home again!

215
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,480
Just let me stay
between these beams.

216
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,150
I promise i’ll live out the rest
of my life in peace and quiet.

217
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,290
Narrator: New morioh landmark,
the man in the electrical tower.

218
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,390
He’s a marvel
of self-sufficiency,

219
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,790
but if you bring him
a bit of salt or snacks,

220
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,060
he’ll be happy
to let you take a picture,

221
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,400
but don’t expect him to be
able to muster up the courage

222
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,770
to take off his mask
or divulge his real name.

223
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,230
Josuke: Yeah, that’s fine,

224
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,200
but tell us more
about the old guy.

225
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,640
Did he tell you anything else,

226
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,310
like the whereabouts of his son,
yoshikage Kira?

227
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,340
Anything would help us.

228
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,740
( Toyohiro sighs )

229
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,410
well, actually,
he did mention a stand user.

230
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,680
- I think his name was koichi.
- ( Both gasp )

231
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,020
josuke: What else
do you know about koichi?!

232
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,550
Toyohiro: Hey,
take it easy, man.

233
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,360
The geezer and I were just
having some casual conversation.

234
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,690
He barely even mentioned him.

235
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,290
The subject never came up again,

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,760
so I didn’t think
to ask anything,

237
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,760
and he didn’t elaborate
on who the guy was.

238
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,600
Okuyasu: Get to the point!
What did he say about koichi?

239
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,570
Toyohiro: Well, he told me that
he found a way to eliminate him.

240
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,170
( All gasp )

241
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,170
Josuke: He said
he got rid of him?!

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,170
toyohiro: And if
his son’s yoshikage Kira,

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,480
then it seems like the old man

244
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,140
might have already
caught up to him.

245
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,380
He said, from now on,

246
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,480
he would do more
than just protect his son.

247
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,720
He’d start seeking out
and attacking his enemies.

248
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,350
then he told me that
a recently created stand user

249
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,790
eliminated a user named koichi
just this morning.

250
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,790
But that’s all. I swear.

251
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,490

Look at this door.

254
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,170
this will be
about 800,000 yen by itself!

255
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,700
And these designs are from
the victorian or edwardian era,

256
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,740

English-made materials.

257

This is going to be a doozy.

Rohan: So he doesn’t want
anyone looking at his back.

259
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,110
I suppose that could explain

260
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,750
his rather odd behavior
when he first arrived.

261
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,550

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,590
Josuke: Yuya, for the last time,
where is the scent coming from?!

518
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,730
Man: I imagined, regardless
of josuke’s tough exterior,

519
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,700
plopping his mother
before his eyes

520
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,100
would certainly
stir up pangs of dread.

521
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,570
( Josuke gasps )

522
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,140
Man: Sure enough, there was
josuke’s very own Mark.

523
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,370
When he experiences fear,

524
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,510
he anxiously bites
his lower lip!

525
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,780
The next time josuke
reveals his Mark of fear,

526
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,240
misterioso will eradicate
that do-gooder

527
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,350
once and for all!

528
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,580
Josuke: Hey, yuya, you haven’t

529
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,680
taken your eyes
off my mom, right?

530
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,690
- ( Yuya gasps )
- Josuke: The user,

531
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,690
is it possible
he’s inside her jacket?

532
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,620
i don’t care
what kind of stand it is.

533
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,590
i need to know
what’s inside this pocket!

534
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,900
Man: Oh, is he
gonna bite his lip?!

535
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,260
Come on. Do it!

536
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,560
Josuke: Yuya, answer me!

537
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,830
Is he here or not?!

538
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,240
man: Damn,
fear hasn’t consumed him yet.

539
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,540
Yuya: We’ve been
over this, josuke.

540
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,910
i never promised
to help you fight any enemies.

541
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,910
We only agreed
that i’d track him.

542
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,340
- Josuke: Eh?
- Yuya: Any more,

543
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,880
and i’d be risking my life!

544
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,580
Besides, I only said i’d help
because you healed me.

545
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,480
There’s no way in hell
i’m goin’ down

546
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,820
as that dumbass
who walks right into harm’s way!

547
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,790
Sorry to disappoint you,
but this guy freaks me out!

548
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,690
( Josuke growls )

549
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,390
Then i’ll check for myself.

550
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,700
nothing.
Both pockets are empty,

551
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,430
other than this piece of paper.

552
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,730
( Sighs )

553
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,100
( Yuya gasps )

554
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,670
the scent’s
out of the pocket now.

555
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,400
Could it be? No, you fool.

556
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,170
if you know
what’s good for you,

557
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
you’ll keep
that piece of paper closed.
