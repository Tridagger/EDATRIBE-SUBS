1
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:32,637
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

2
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,425
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

3
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:38,097
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

4
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:42,085
<i>Let's go walking, you and me</i>

5
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,603
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go!</i>

6
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:50,721
<i>Over the hill, across the field</i>

7
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:54,136
<i>Through the tunnel we'll go</i>

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,086
<i>We'll run across the bridge</i>

9
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:02,185
<i>And down the bumpy gravel road</i>

10
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,553
<i>Creep beneath the spider's web</i>

11
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,659
<i>Ready, set, let's go!</i>

12
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,872
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

13
00:01:20,975 --> 00:01:22,683
<i>Hey, let's go!</i>

14
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,139
<i>I'm happy as can be</i>

15
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:30,561
<i>Let's go walking, you and me</i>

16
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,657
<i>Ready, set, come on, let's go!</i>

17
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,557
<i>The foxes and the badgers too</i>

18
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:42,467
<i>All come out to play</i>

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,083
<i>They all want to explore</i>

20
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,442
<i>The deep and wonderful woods all day</i>

21
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:54,472
<i>Look at all my many friends</i>

22
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:57,631
<i>Ready, set, let's go!</i>

23
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:02,477
<i>Look at all my many friends</i>

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,694
<i>Ready, set, let's go!</i>

25
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,751
Hey dad, want some caramel?

26
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:35,354
Thanks. How you doing back there?

27
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:35,831
Fine.

28
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,881
Are you tired? Oop!

29
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:37,441
Mmm-mmm.

30
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:38,806
We're almost there.

31
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:51,789
Mei, hide.

32
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,338
Whoops. I thought that was a policeman.

33
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:01,090
Hi!

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,082
Hello there. Are your parents around?
We're your new neighbors.

35
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,062
Great. Thanks.

36
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:45,134
Hello! Hi, we're the Kusakabes!
We're moving in down the street.

37
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,553
Why don't you and your family stop by sometime?

38
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:49,414
Okey, sure. Good to meet you.

39
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:49,994
Uh!

40
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,206
Hey, thanks a lot.

41
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,793
This is it, girls.

42
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:21,338
Wait up!

43
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:22,612
Here you go.

44
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,258
Mei, look at this bridge.

45
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:27,735
A bridge?

46
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:34,527
There's a fish! Oh, look! There's another one!

47
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,078
So, how do you like the new place?

48
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:41,338
Dad, it's perfect.

49
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,862
Look at this. A tunnel of trees.

50
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:47,988
Oh, wow! Look!

51
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,285
Dad, hurry!

52
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:08,991
Wow! It's creepy.

53
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:10,803
Creepy!

54
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,566
It looks like it could be haunted.

55
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:14,122
What, haunted?

56
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,226
Whoa.

57
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:18,811
Whoa.

58
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,013
Look. It's rotten.

59
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,646
It's collapsing!

60
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:36,811
It's collapsing!

61
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:48,874
Mei, look at that.

62
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:49,324
Huh?

63
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:52,401
Look.

64
00:06:01,353 --> 00:06:03,540
Wow! It's huge, isn't it?

65
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:04,119
Ah-choo!

66
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,247
Dad, what's that big tree?

67
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,866
Uh, that's a camphor tree.

68
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:17,292
A camphor tree.

69
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:18,353
Camphor tree!

70
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,528
Don't forget to take your shoes off, girls.

71
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,195
Huh?

72
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:28,797
Whoa!

73
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,817
An acorn.

74
00:06:34,845 --> 00:06:36,424
Let me see.

75
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,617
Another one!

76
00:06:43,938 --> 00:06:44,901
Here's one.

77
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:54,879
Out of the way, Mei.
I can't close the door with you there.

78
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,367
Acorns.

79
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,827
Dad, acorns are falling from the ceiling.

80
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:00,663
Falling from the ceiling.

81
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:02,745
Hmm.

82
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,646
Maybe squirrels live here.

83
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:09,991
Squirrels?

84
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,258
I think rats eat acorns. Maybe they're rats.

85
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,970
No! Squirrels are better!

86
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:18,347
Mister, where do you want your radio?

87
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,266
Oh, right, the radio. In here's good, I guess.

88
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,055
Satsuki, open the back of the house?

89
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,586
Okay.

90
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,232
Can you find the back door?

91
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:26,105
Of course!

92
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:29,074
Come on!

93
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,016
Hey, wait for me!

94
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:35,248
Well, hurry it up, then.

95
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:14,201
Let's go.

96
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:15,160
Hmph!

97
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:27,834
The bath.

98
00:08:27,859 --> 00:08:28,399
Yep.

99
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:35,582
I think they're gone.

100
00:08:37,468 --> 00:08:38,802
Hey, you found the bath.

101
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,763
Something's running around in here.

102
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:41,858
More squirrels?

103
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:42,872
I don't think so.

104
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:47,061
They're not bugs or mice either.
They were black and they were all over the place.

105
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:48,978
Hmm. Let's have a look.

106
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,427
Ah.

107
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:01,099
So?

108
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,536
It's probably just some soot gremlins.

109
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,456
What do you mean, "gremlins"? Like the ones in my book?

110
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,957
Well, it could be ghosts,

111
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,120
but ghosts don't usually like to
come out on nice days like this.

112
00:09:15,714 --> 00:09:18,425
Normally, you can't see soot gremlins, but once in awhile,

113
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:21,653
when you go from bright places to dark
ones, you catch a glimpse.

114
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,185
So that's it.

115
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,528
Come out, come out...

116
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,184
Wherever you are!

117
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:30,687
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

118
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:40,854
Hey, I need your help. It looks like somebody's
hidden the stairs to the top of the house.

119
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:41,743
What?

120
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:45,094
Can you find the stairs and open the windows up there?

121
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,181
Yeah!

122
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,231
Wail for me!

123
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:55,548
Nope.

124
00:09:56,672 --> 00:09:58,006
The toilet!

125
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,136
Not here.

126
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:05,246
Nothing here.

127
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,590
Nothing here.

128
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,477
Nope.

129
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:10,983
Nope.

130
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,091
Ahh!

131
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,540
Nope.

132
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:23,782
Nope. Hey!

133
00:10:32,013 --> 00:10:34,084
Mei, I found the stairs.

134
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,217
It's pitch-black.

135
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,566
Maybe it's the soot gremlins.

136
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:53,850
An acorn.

137
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:04,698
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

138
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,263
Hmph.

139
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:30,783
Ahh!

140
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:45,697
We know you're in here, soot gremlins.

141
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:46,903
Come on out.

142
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:54,887
Hey!

143
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,596
Huh?

144
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,641
Okay, lift.

145
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:16,654
Dad, come here! There's definitely
something weird in this house!

146
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:18,227
That's great.

147
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:22,685
I've always wanted to live in a haunted
house ever since I was a little boy.

148
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:23,986
Oh!

149
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,845
Ahh!

150
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,590
I caught one! Satsuki, look!

151
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:23,607
Ah!

152
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,424
Hi.

153
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:29,501
Mei?

154
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:34,871
Oh.

155
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:38,353
Whoa. Hey!

156
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:42,064
What a ball of energy!

157
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:44,816
This is our neighbor. She takes care of this house.

158
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,259
She said you can call her "Granny" if you'd like.

159
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,579
I'm Satsuki, and that's Mei. Nice to meet you.

160
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,325
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

161
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:56,286
What nice manners you have.

162
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,631
I'm sorry I didn't have time to
clean up more before you got here.

163
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:02,501
No, it's fine.

164
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,795
We've been busy in the rice fields,

165
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:09,194
but I did manage to keep the
place well-dusted, as you can see.

166
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,486
Mei, your hands are filthy. What on earth did you do?

167
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:14,738
I caught a soot gremlin, but he got away.

168
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,297
Ahh! Your feet!

169
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,274
Mine are black, too!

170
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:24,869
Ah...

171
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,492
You've got soot sprites in your house.

172
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:37,867
Soot sprites? The black puff balls? About this big?

173
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,163
They scurry everywhere when you enter a room?

174
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,378
That's right.

175
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,970
They live in old, empty houses

176
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:49,285
and run all over the place, covering everything with dirt.

177
00:14:49,965 --> 00:14:53,289
I used to be able to see them when I was your age.

178
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:57,222
So you've seen them, too. That's very interesting.

179
00:14:57,305 --> 00:14:59,230
So they're a kind of ghost, then?

180
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,370
Don't worry, dear. They're nothing to be afraid of.

181
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:07,065
If they decide you're nice people, they won't harm you,

182
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,384
and after a while, they'll just go away.

183
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:14,713
I bet they're up in the rafters right now,
having a talk about whether or not they should move out.

184
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:22,636
Hear that? They're gonna move out.

185
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:23,939
I don't want them to leave.

186
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:26,793
What if a huge one came chasing after you?

187
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:28,378
So what? I'm not afraid.

188
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:32,160
Right. Then you can go to the bathroom
alone in the middle of the night.

189
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,594
Come on, girls.

190
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:39,264
Let's get to work. Who'd like to fetch water for the pump?

191
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:40,487
I'll go get it.

192
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:42,099
I'll go, too!

193
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:47,526
Mei, wait there, okay?

194
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:58,219
Did you catch a fish?

195
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:12,627
Granny, the pump's working!

196
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,605
Keep pumping!

197
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,344
Don't stop until the water gets cold.

198
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:18,424
Okay.

199
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:04,015
Oh. Hello again. Can I help you?

200
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,971
Eh... My... mom said to give this to Granny.

201
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,939
Oh. What is it?

202
00:17:13,316 --> 00:17:13,955
Mmm.

203
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,415
Hmm?

204
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,053
Mmm! Eh...

205
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,780
Hey, wait! What is this?

206
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,391
Is that Kanta?

207
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:26,037
Hey, you in there!

208
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,405
Your house is haunted!

209
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,438
Kanta!

210
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,504
Mmm.

211
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,191
Satsuki, I acted just like that when I was a boy.

212
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,891
I hate boys, but I'm glad he brought this cake you made.

213
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:48,268
It's great, Granny.

214
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:50,538
Eat all you like.

215
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,106
Thanks, moving man!

216
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,162
Thanks, moving man!

217
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:57,819
Thanks for everything, Granny.

218
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,581
Good-bye, Granny!

219
00:18:00,606 --> 00:18:01,934
Good-bye, Granny!

220
00:19:15,932 --> 00:19:19,359
Dad, this house is too old. I think it's gonna fall down.

221
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,163
That would be a problem, since we just moved in here.

222
00:19:25,699 --> 00:19:26,700
Huh?

223
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:02,625
Everybody, try laughing.
Then whatever scares you will go away.

224
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,489
But, Dad, I'm not scared.

225
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,910
What? I'm not scared.

226
00:20:53,828 --> 00:20:56,581
One, two, one, two, one, two.

227
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,918
That's it. Stamp that dirt out, girls. That's it.

228
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:00,993
One, two...

229
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,717
Okay. That's all the chores.

230
00:21:07,793 --> 00:21:08,474
You're done.

231
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:10,460
Yay!

232
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:19,992
Ready? Hold on!

233
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,108
Who-o-oa!

234
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:28,947
Whoo-ooo!

235
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,631
Granny!

236
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,422
Hi, Granny!

237
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,027
Good afternoon!

238
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:46,881
Hello there, Kusakabes! Where are you headed?

239
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,093
We're going to visit Mom at the hospital!

240
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:52,804
That's good! Say hi!

241
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:55,348
Tell her I hope she's feeling better.

242
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,516
We will!

243
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,842
Mmm.

244
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,085
Mmm.

245
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:15,326
Hey, this way. Whoa!

246
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:33,109
Hey, Dad. There it is.

247
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:43,398
Good afternoon, ma'am.

248
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,469
Hello, dear.

249
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,069
Mommy!

250
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:49,593
Hi, Mei. It's so good to see you.

251
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:52,238
Daddy kept getting lost the whole way here, Mom.

252
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:54,991
Oh, he did? No school?

253
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,910
No, it's a rice-planting day.

254
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:58,202
Oh, is that so?

255
00:22:58,286 --> 00:23:00,510
Hey, Mom, Dad's talking to the doctor.

256
00:23:00,955 --> 00:23:03,322
I am so happy to see you girls.

257
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:06,501
So how do you like it in the country? Have you settled in?

258
00:23:06,544 --> 00:23:07,382
Yeah.

259
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,018
Hmm?

260
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,260
Mei's scared...

261
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:13,810
A haunted house?

262
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:14,262
Mmm-hmm.

263
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:16,971
Mommy, do you like haunted houses?

264
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:20,683
Of course. I'll have to get better
soon so I can meet some ghosts.

265
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:21,761
See that, Mei?

266
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:22,876
Mmm-hmm.

267
00:23:22,936 --> 00:23:26,442
Mei was worried that you wouldn't
come home if the house was haunted.

268
00:23:26,648 --> 00:23:27,870
Do you two like it?

269
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:28,882
Yeah!

270
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:30,844
I'm not scared at all.

271
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,823
Oh, what cute hair. Did you do this, Satsuki?

272
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:36,548
Mmm-hmm.

273
00:23:36,858 --> 00:23:39,184
It's very nice, huh, Mei?

274
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:40,887
What a lucky girl you are.

275
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,980
Yeah, but she yells at me a lot.

276
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,026
That's because you never sit still.

277
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,192
Let's see your hair, Satsuki.

278
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,020
You sure it isn't a little too short?

279
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:51,005
No, I like it this way, Mom.

280
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:52,890
Brush my hair! Brush mine!

281
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,282
Wait your turn, Mei.

282
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:56,371
Your hair will never cooperate.

283
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:59,097
It's exactly like my hair when I was your age.

284
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,265
Do you think it will start cooperating soon?

285
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:02,767
I want it to look like yours.

286
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:05,349
I think it will.

287
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:07,605
You and I are a lot alike, Satsuki.

288
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:27,229
Mom looked great, didn't she, Dad?

289
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:31,178
Yeah, she did, her doctor said she
should be able to come home soon.

290
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:33,609
So she'll be home tomorrow?

291
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,615
There she goes again with tomorrow.

292
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:37,677
Tomorrow might be a bit soon.

293
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,888
Mom said she was gonna sleep in my bed with me.

294
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,975
I thought you weren't scared to sleep alone.

295
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:45,685
Can't you sleep by yourself?

296
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:47,480
She's the one who's scared, not me.

297
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:13,087
Hey, Dad! Look, it's morning!

298
00:25:15,757 --> 00:25:16,422
Umph!

299
00:25:16,676 --> 00:25:19,242
Hey, wake up!

300
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,018
Sorry. I overslept again.

301
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,734
I have to take lunch to school today.

302
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:30,730
Oh, no. I forgot all about that.

303
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:33,274
That's okay. I'm making lunch for everyone.

304
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:34,448
Hey, it's burning!

305
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:35,967
I'm coming. Just a minute.

306
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,159
I'm making this one for you, Mei.

307
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:42,432
I get one?

308
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:44,968
Mei, sit down and eat.

309
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:48,421
There you go. Wrap it up so it stays fresh. Okay?

310
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:55,390
Satsuki!

311
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:56,566
That's Michiko.

312
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,616
Hi!

313
00:26:00,718 --> 00:26:02,845
So, you made a friend already, did you?

314
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,519
Satsuki, time for school!

315
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:06,695
She's walking to school with me.

316
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,311
I gotta go.

317
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,122
See you later!

318
00:26:14,036 --> 00:26:16,288
Have a nice day!

319
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,569
Hi, Michiko.

320
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:20,057
Hi. Ready for school?

321
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:20,413
Yep.

322
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:34,392
Hey, Dad.

323
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,592
Do I look like a big girl?

324
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:39,935
You do. Are you going somewhere?

325
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,818
I'm just off to run some errands.

326
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:06,750
Dad, is it lunchtime yet?

327
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:08,578
What? We just ate breakfast.

328
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:23,123
Dad, you be the flower shop. Okay?

329
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,866
Hey, tadpoles.

330
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:02,089
What a stupid bucket.

331
00:28:03,174 --> 00:28:04,272
Huh?

332
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:16,872
Acorn.

333
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:18,595
Ha!

334
00:29:07,989 --> 00:29:08,728
Huh?

335
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:45,775
Ha!

336
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:31,229
Hey!

337
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,447
Bleh!

338
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:48,889
Ahh!

339
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:56,199
Hey!

340
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:03,881
Ahh! Ahh!

341
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,452
Whoa!

342
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,163
Ahh...

343
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,082
Ah-choo!

344
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,443
Who are you? A great big soot gremlin?

345
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:21,535
To-to-ro!

346
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:25,681
Totoro?

347
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,218
Is that what your name is? Totoro?

348
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:32,021
Totoro.

349
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:34,481
Yep, that's your name, all right.

350
00:34:36,483 --> 00:34:38,745
Mmm. Totoro.

351
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,320
Bye.

352
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:49,504
See you later!

353
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,220
I'm home!

354
00:35:52,514 --> 00:35:53,252
Hi there.

355
00:35:53,644 --> 00:35:54,921
Wow. Is it that late already?

356
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:55,741
Where's Mei?

357
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,052
Did she like her lunch box?

358
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:00,323
We haven't eaten yet. She's running
around with that lunch box all day.

359
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,269
Mei!

360
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,613
Mei!

361
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:06,736
Mei?

362
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:11,335
Mei?

363
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,388
Hey, Dad! Come here!

364
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,512
I found Mei's hat!

365
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,315
Mei! Mei!

366
00:36:42,735 --> 00:36:44,319
Hmm? Hmm.

367
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:48,413
Hey, Mei, wake up!

368
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,519
What do you think you're doing, sleeping out here?

369
00:36:53,649 --> 00:36:55,080
Totoro?

370
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:56,183
Totoro?

371
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,916
Where's Totoro?

372
00:37:01,003 --> 00:37:03,046
Maybe you were dreaming.

373
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,129
No, I saw Totoro.

374
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:05,865
Totoro?

375
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,277
You mean a troll, like the one in your storybook?

376
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:11,430
Mmm-hmm. But he called himself Totoro.

377
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:15,121
He was furry, with a great big mouth.

378
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:18,652
There was a little one, and a bigger one,

379
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:22,901
and a huge one that kept falling asleep.

380
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:26,945
There you are.

381
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:31,617
Wow. This would make a great secret hiding place.

382
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,620
Dad, Mei said that she saw a Totoro here.

383
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:35,986
A Totoro?

384
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:36,729
Mmm-hmm.

385
00:37:37,581 --> 00:37:38,855
This way!

386
00:37:46,423 --> 00:37:48,300
Hey, wait up!

387
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:51,487
Huh?

388
00:37:53,806 --> 00:37:54,642
Here?

389
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:55,991
Mmm-mmm.

390
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,936
Last time the tunnel led to Totoro's tree.

391
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,942
I didn't see another path to take.

392
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,610
Hey, where are you going?

393
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:06,264
Mei, come back!

394
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:23,069
Quit laughing! I really did see Totoro!

395
00:38:23,544 --> 00:38:24,962
I'm not lying.

396
00:38:25,045 --> 00:38:25,658
Mmm.

397
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:34,811
Mei?

398
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,560
It's not a lie, Dad.

399
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,910
Hmm. Don't worry, Mei.

400
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:42,692
Satsuki and I believe you, and I bet I know what happened.

401
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:46,387
You must have met one of the spirits of the forest.

402
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,975
That means you're a very lucky girl.

403
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:51,321
But you can't always see the spirits.

404
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:53,609
You can only see them when they want you to.

405
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:56,326
Let's give the forest spirits a proper greeting.

406
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:57,350
A greeting?

407
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,122
Of course. Come on. Let's go.

408
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,150
Oh, Mei, you're getting heavy.

409
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,740
Dad, there's that big camphor tree.

410
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,936
It's incredible.

411
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:32,151
That's it!

412
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,429
That's Totoro's tree?

413
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:35,431
Yeah!

414
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,118
Come on, Dad! Can't you go any faster?

415
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:44,667
Whoa.

416
00:39:48,968 --> 00:39:50,547
Totoro's hole is gone.

417
00:39:50,631 --> 00:39:52,042
Are you sure it was here?

418
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:52,997
Mmm-hmm.

419
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,719
Dad, she says the hole disappeared.

420
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:58,639
Then, right now the forest spirits don't want to be seen.

421
00:39:58,838 --> 00:40:01,237
But, Dad, I want to see them, too.

422
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:04,311
Maybe you will, if you're lucky.

423
00:40:05,312 --> 00:40:07,765
Mmm. Magnificent tree.

424
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:10,944
It's been around since long ago,

425
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:14,207
back in the time when trees and people used to be friends.

426
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:23,845
When I saw this tree, I knew this would
be a good place for our family to live.

427
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,959
And I think it will make your mother feel right at home.

428
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:30,394
So, let's give this tree a nice
greeting and go eat our lunch.

429
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,298
I want to write Mom a letter and tell her about this.

430
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:34,629
I will, too!

431
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:36,043
Attention!

432
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:40,180
Thank you for watching over Mei
and making us feel so welcome here.

433
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:43,621
Please continue to look after us.

434
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:45,584
Last one home's a rotten egg!

435
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,235
Hey, no fair!

436
00:40:48,313 --> 00:40:49,285
Wait!

437
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:51,361
Uh!

438
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:52,600
Hurry it up!

439
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,734
Wail for me!

440
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:00,826
Dear Mom: We had an exciting day today.

441
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:04,523
Mei met a big forest spirit called Totoro.

442
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:11,570
I hope I'll be able to see him someday, too.

443
00:41:44,244 --> 00:41:47,006
Kanta, hurry up, or you'll be late for school.

444
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:48,324
Yeah.

445
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,518
Back to work.

446
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:25,355
Oh.

447
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:31,813
Mei?

448
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,127
Miss Hara!

449
00:42:34,278 --> 00:42:35,365
Yes, Satsuki?

450
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,839
Uh, my sister's here.

451
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,163
Her sister?

452
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,690
Granny, what's wrong?

453
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,082
I don't know.

454
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:51,668
She said she wouldn't stop crying
unless I brought her to you.

455
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:54,706
She said that? Mei, be reasonable.

456
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:56,755
You know you had to stay with Granny in the day.

457
00:42:56,817 --> 00:42:59,725
Because, I have school and Dad's
teaching at the university.

458
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:04,299
I only have two more hours of school to go.

459
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:06,520
Can't you just stay with Granny until then?

460
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:10,288
She's been so good up till now. Weren't you, Mei?

461
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,758
Well, I'll talk to my teacher and see what we can do.

462
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,349
Satsuki's mom is in the hospital,

463
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:33,133
so her sister Mei is going to
stay with us today, okay, class?

464
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,945
Let's make her feel welcome.

465
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,380
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:43,700
What are you drawing, Mei?

467
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:45,194
It's a big Totoro.

468
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:48,552
Shh. Mei, try to keep quiet, will you?

469
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:49,482
Mmm-hmm.

470
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,006
Bye, Mei!

471
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:02,799
Come again soon!

472
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:05,302
I have to skip our club meeting, Michiko.

473
00:44:05,385 --> 00:44:07,929
I'll let everyone know. Bye!

474
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:11,725
Hurry up, Mei. It's gonna rain.

475
00:44:11,808 --> 00:44:12,469
Okay.

476
00:44:20,734 --> 00:44:22,188
Ah! Here it comes!

477
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:23,677
Here it comes!

478
00:44:34,748 --> 00:44:35,510
Come on.

479
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:41,628
I didn't even cry. That's good, huh?

480
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:42,017
Hmm.

481
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:46,299
Yeah, but we're not home yet.

482
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:51,961
We'd like to share your roof for a
while, sir, if you don't mind.

483
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:28,248
Mmm.

484
00:45:28,273 --> 00:45:28,684
Huh?

485
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:30,251
Don't you...

486
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:32,671
Mmm. Mmm!

487
00:45:34,803 --> 00:45:35,803
Mmm!

488
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:38,821
Hey!

489
00:45:57,747 --> 00:45:59,351
That was lucky, wasn't it?

490
00:45:59,376 --> 00:45:59,898
Mmm-hmm.

491
00:46:01,835 --> 00:46:03,697
This umbrella has holes.

492
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:04,695
Hmm.

493
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,023
Dad left his umbrella here.

494
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:17,124
I better take it to him.

495
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,667
I wanna go, too.

496
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,481
What? I left it.

497
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:27,531
What kind of fool forgets his
umbrella at school when it's raining?

498
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:29,057
Hey!

499
00:46:29,082 --> 00:46:31,887
I bet you were swinging it around and you broke it.

500
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:33,022
No, I didn't.

501
00:46:40,957 --> 00:46:41,985
Ahh.

502
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:48,229
Hello! Is anyone home?

503
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,606
Oh, Satsuki and Mei. Come in. Granny!

504
00:46:55,138 --> 00:46:56,514
Thanks for watching Mei today.

505
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:58,683
Sorry we couldn't keep her happy.

506
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:02,051
Oh. I wanted to give back this
umbrella that Kanta lent us.

507
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,373
What? He lent you this? Oh, my. Look how beat up it is.

508
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:08,479
Mei was walking home from school with me.

509
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,713
So, it was really nice of him to help us out.
Tell him thank you.

510
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:12,865
He must have been drenched.

511
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:13,931
That's okay.

512
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:17,552
Kanta is such a dirty kid.
He can always use a good drenching.

513
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,829
Are you off to meet your dad at the bus stop?

514
00:47:19,913 --> 00:47:21,318
Yes, he forgot his umbrella.

515
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,439
Such good kids.

516
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:23,400
Bye, girls.

517
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:24,163
Bye!

518
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,280
Who was at the door, Kanta?

519
00:47:37,305 --> 00:47:38,289
Beats me.

520
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:44,209
There's the bus, Mei!

521
00:47:57,492 --> 00:47:58,743
Are you getting on?

522
00:48:00,306 --> 00:48:01,400
Drive on.

523
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,507
Satsuki, Dad wasn't on the bus.

524
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,152
He'll be on the next one for sure.

525
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:16,909
Do you want to go back to Granny's and wait there?

526
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:53,846
What's the matter?

527
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,681
What is it, Mei? Are you sleepy?

528
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:33,463
I knew this would happen.
Don't you want to wait at Granny's?

529
00:49:33,546 --> 00:49:34,723
Mmm-mmm.

530
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,330
It's okay, Mei. He'll be here soon.

531
00:49:44,426 --> 00:49:46,344
That bus sure is late, huh?

532
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:55,187
Here.

533
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:20,255
Totoro?

534
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:31,804
Oh, wait a minute.

535
00:51:37,629 --> 00:51:39,003
Here. Try this.

536
00:51:40,452 --> 00:51:42,683
Hurry. Mei's slipping.

537
00:51:48,687 --> 00:51:50,689
Hold it over your head. Like this.

538
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:05,591
Oh.

539
00:53:07,427 --> 00:53:08,858
Here comes the bus.

540
00:53:11,764 --> 00:53:12,500
Huh?

541
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:19,493
Well, Mei, so much for bringing Dad his umbrella.

542
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,209
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

543
00:54:34,788 --> 00:54:35,725
Drive on.

544
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,977
My train was delayed, so I had to wait for the next bus.

545
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,486
Were you worried?

546
00:54:42,396 --> 00:54:44,774
Totoro came back, Dad! I saw him!

547
00:54:44,857 --> 00:54:47,007
We saw a cat bus, too!

548
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:47,914
What?

549
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:50,303
It was huge!

550
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:51,981
With eyes like this.

551
00:54:52,073 --> 00:54:53,078
It was great!

552
00:54:53,103 --> 00:54:54,307
It was great!

553
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:57,829
I saw Totoro! I saw him!

554
00:54:57,912 --> 00:54:59,163
I saw him, too!

555
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:13,314
Hey, Dad, pick us up.

556
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:14,472
Come on, Dad.

557
00:55:24,897 --> 00:55:28,154
We had such a weird, mysterious, spectacular day.

558
00:55:28,442 --> 00:55:30,141
My heart is still pounding.

559
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,550
Totoro gave us a wonderful present.

560
00:55:33,906 --> 00:55:35,491
It was wrapped in a bamboo leaf

561
00:55:35,575 --> 00:55:37,648
and tied with a ribbon made of grass.

562
00:55:38,077 --> 00:55:40,663
As soon as we got home, we opened it.

563
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:42,540
It was filled with acorns.

564
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:46,233
Ahh.

565
00:55:47,962 --> 00:55:50,798
"We wanted to grow a beautiful forest with the acorns,

566
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:53,872
" so we planted them IN your garden out back, but..."

567
00:55:54,243 --> 00:56:00,234
... they just won't grow.
Mei watches them all day, every day,

568
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:01,713
waiting for them to sprout,

569
00:56:01,851 --> 00:56:03,508
it's starting to make her crabby.

570
00:56:03,853 --> 00:56:05,663
Here's a picture of Mei as a crab.

571
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:12,028
Summer vacation is almost here,

572
00:56:12,111 --> 00:56:14,068
and I can't wait to play outside with you.

573
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,713
Please get well soon. Love, Satsuki.

574
00:56:20,453 --> 00:56:23,688
Get ready, and... up!

575
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:27,304
Lights out, girls.

576
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:28,194
Wait, Dad.

577
00:56:29,128 --> 00:56:32,182
Do you think that they'll sprout tomorrow?

578
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:33,549
I don't know.

579
00:56:33,633 --> 00:56:35,741
You should ask the Totoro. He would know.

580
00:56:36,344 --> 00:56:37,322
Good night, girls.

581
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,217
Mei.

582
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:47,522
That's where we planted the acorns.

583
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,186
Ahh!

584
00:58:29,662 --> 00:58:30,979
Ow!

585
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,369
Yay! We did it! We did it!

586
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:22,917
Yay!

587
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:40,246
Mei, we're the wind!

588
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:32,262
Mmm...

589
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:42,566
Where'd the tree go?

590
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,326
Ahh!

591
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:49,615
They're growing! We did it!

592
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:50,699
We did it!

593
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:56,165
I thought it was a dream!

594
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:57,355
But it wasn't!

595
01:01:57,414 --> 01:02:01,544
I thought it was a dream! We did it!

596
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,862
We did it!

597
01:02:18,053 --> 01:02:20,270
Mr. Kusakabe? Telegram!

598
01:02:21,628 --> 01:02:22,712
Mr. Kusakabe?

599
01:02:24,733 --> 01:02:25,927
A telegram for you.

600
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:28,992
Huh. No one's home.

601
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:37,663
Granny!

602
01:02:42,334 --> 01:02:43,752
I'm over here.

603
01:02:45,671 --> 01:02:47,490
This one's ready to eat.

604
01:02:56,849 --> 01:02:58,375
What about this one, Granny?

605
01:02:58,628 --> 01:02:59,327
Try it.

606
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:08,915
Wow, Granny. Your garden is just like a market.

607
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:12,681
We've picked enough, haven't we? Let's take a rest.

608
01:03:19,204 --> 01:03:21,261
Mmm. Nice and cold.

609
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:23,129
Mark, get set, go!

610
01:03:32,384 --> 01:03:33,736
It's delicious.

611
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:36,805
I'm glad you like it. They're very good for you.

612
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:40,059
They've soaked up lots of vitamins and sunshine.

613
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,237
Would they help Mom get better?

614
01:03:42,262 --> 01:03:43,753
Of course they would.

615
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:47,649
If your mom eats my vegetables,
I bet she'd get well right away.

616
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:50,484
That's great, Granny. Mom's coming home on Saturday.

617
01:03:50,736 --> 01:03:52,988
She's going to sleep with me in my bed.

618
01:03:53,072 --> 01:03:56,792
Oh, good! She's finally leaving the hospital, is she?

619
01:03:57,328 --> 01:04:00,885
No. The doctor wants her to get used
to the new house a little at a time.

620
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,887
She goes back on Monday.

621
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:03,810
Is that so?

622
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:07,086
We'll feed her lots of my vegetables while she's here.

623
01:04:07,169 --> 01:04:10,282
I'll give her the corn that I picked.
That will make her better.

624
01:04:11,006 --> 01:04:13,326
I bet that will do her wonders.

625
01:04:13,351 --> 01:04:13,881
Yep.

626
01:04:22,101 --> 01:04:24,353
Here. The postman left us your telegram.

627
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:25,481
A telegram?

628
01:04:29,608 --> 01:04:32,569
What should I do with it? Dad won't be home till evening.

629
01:04:32,653 --> 01:04:35,185
Better open it. Might be an emergency.

630
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:36,613
Mmm-hmm.

631
01:04:39,203 --> 01:04:42,300
"Please contact Shichikokuyama."

632
01:04:43,058 --> 01:04:46,009
Shichikokuyama! It's from Mom's hospital!

633
01:04:46,667 --> 01:04:48,378
Something must have happened to her.

634
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:52,881
We have to get to the hospital right away, Granny.

635
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:56,635
Okay. Calm down.
First, we need to get in touch with your father.

636
01:04:56,718 --> 01:05:00,192
I know his phone number at the
university, but we don't have a phone.

637
01:05:00,305 --> 01:05:04,005
Kanta, take Satsuki to your uncle's
house and let her use the phone.

638
01:05:04,393 --> 01:05:05,118
Mmm-hmm.

639
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:12,841
Mei, you need to stay here with me!

640
01:05:21,692 --> 01:05:24,099
Mei, go back and stay with Granny!

641
01:05:32,796 --> 01:05:33,608
Uh!

642
01:06:01,408 --> 01:06:04,657
Hello? I'd like to place a long-distance call, please.

643
01:06:04,912 --> 01:06:08,240
It's to my dad at Tokyo 31-13-82.

644
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:09,248
Right.

645
01:06:11,126 --> 01:06:14,151
Now, that's a nice girl, eh, Kanta?

646
01:06:16,632 --> 01:06:17,155
Hello?

647
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:18,552
Yes.

648
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:22,899
Hello? I need to speak to my dad
in the archaeology department.

649
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:25,409
I mean, I need to speak to Mr. Kusakabe.

650
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:27,673
My name is Satsuki Kusakabe.

651
01:06:31,813 --> 01:06:33,982
Hello, Dad? Is that you? It's Satsuki.

652
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:35,199
What's wrong?

653
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,133
We got a telegram.

654
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:38,240
You're to call Mom's doctor at the hospital.

655
01:06:38,654 --> 01:06:40,045
What? The hospital?

656
01:06:40,614 --> 01:06:42,824
Okay. I'll call them right away.

657
01:06:42,908 --> 01:06:45,518
Did something happen to her? Do you think she's okay?

658
01:06:45,744 --> 01:06:46,997
Let's not worry.

659
01:06:47,496 --> 01:06:50,627
I'll call the hospital,
and I'll call you right back. Okay?

660
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:51,360
Yeah.

661
01:06:51,385 --> 01:06:52,483
Wait by the phone.

662
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,258
Mmm-hmm.

663
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,173
I need to hang up now. Okay?

664
01:06:57,631 --> 01:07:01,593
Excuse me, is it okay if I wait here?
My dad's going to call me back.

665
01:07:01,677 --> 01:07:04,346
Of course. Make yourself at home.

666
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:13,317
Satsuki!

667
01:07:22,197 --> 01:07:24,408
Back off! Don't touch my corn!

668
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:25,784
It's for my mommy!

669
01:07:26,994 --> 01:07:30,041
Too bad! She needs it to make her better.

670
01:07:46,305 --> 01:07:49,433
Mei, the doctor said that Mom's not doing well.

671
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:51,893
So she doesn't get to come home this weekend.

672
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,536
No fair!

673
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:56,747
It can't be helped, Mei.

674
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:58,942
What if she came and it made her worse?

675
01:07:59,026 --> 01:08:00,773
It's not fair!

676
01:08:02,154 --> 01:08:04,364
Mei, we just have to wait a little longer.

677
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:05,913
No!

678
01:08:07,339 --> 01:08:08,719
You want her to die, Mei?

679
01:08:08,744 --> 01:08:09,697
Is that what you want?

680
01:08:09,856 --> 01:08:11,937
No!

681
01:08:12,127 --> 01:08:14,296
You're such a baby! Just grow up!

682
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:26,587
Come on, Mei.

683
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:33,685
She's so mean!

684
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:03,299
Come on, girls. Let's put the laundry away.

685
01:09:04,549 --> 01:09:08,105
Oh, don't be sad. Granny's here to help.

686
01:09:15,769 --> 01:09:19,658
Don't worry. Your father is going to stop by the hospital.

687
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:23,416
The doctors say your mom just has a cold.

688
01:09:23,902 --> 01:09:26,656
She should be home next Saturday.

689
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:33,045
This is just like last time.

690
01:09:33,412 --> 01:09:36,882
They said Mom just had a little
cold, she'd be home in a few days.

691
01:09:39,251 --> 01:09:41,584
Granny, what will we do if she dies?

692
01:09:41,712 --> 01:09:43,213
Satsuki!

693
01:09:43,922 --> 01:09:45,414
Maybe she's dead already.

694
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:52,542
Now, don't say that, sweetheart.

695
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:57,644
How could she ever leave such sweet girls like you?

696
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,063
Oh, don't cry.

697
01:10:00,147 --> 01:10:02,265
Don't cry. It's all right.

698
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:06,443
I'll stay here until your father comes home. Okay? Okay?

699
01:10:48,313 --> 01:10:49,555
Mei!

700
01:10:55,744 --> 01:10:57,443
Mei!

701
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:02,687
Mei!

702
01:11:05,378 --> 01:11:06,399
Did she come back?

703
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:07,199
No.

704
01:11:07,589 --> 01:11:08,997
She wasn't at the bus stop?

705
01:11:09,187 --> 01:11:09,996
No.

706
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:11,927
Let's think.

707
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,179
Do you know where else she might have gone?

708
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:17,592
I yelled at her this morning. She wanted Mom to come home.

709
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,872
Granny, I bet she went to see Mom at the hospital!

710
01:11:21,269 --> 01:11:23,400
You think she'd try to walk to the hospital?

711
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:26,691
Why, that's a three-hour walk even for grown-ups.

712
01:11:26,775 --> 01:11:27,626
I'll go look.

713
01:11:30,028 --> 01:11:33,507
Kanta! Hurry! Run on home and get your father!

714
01:11:33,532 --> 01:11:36,409
Mei's disappeared, and we need all the help we can get!

715
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,757
I shouldn't have yelled at her. This is all my fault.

716
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:58,284
Mei!

717
01:12:05,063 --> 01:12:07,660
Excuse me, mister! Hello!

718
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:08,582
Yeah?

719
01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:10,545
I'm looking for my sister.

720
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:13,309
Did you happen to see a little girl pass this way?

721
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:16,265
Let's see. Uh, a little girl?

722
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:18,918
Mmm, I don't think so. I would have noticed.

723
01:12:20,199 --> 01:12:21,333
I'll try the other road.

724
01:12:40,932 --> 01:12:43,207
Are you sure that this is the way she came?

725
01:12:43,518 --> 01:12:44,508
I don't know.

726
01:12:53,278 --> 01:12:55,504
Mei!

727
01:13:16,927 --> 01:13:19,596
Stop! Please, stop!

728
01:13:21,348 --> 01:13:22,607
Oh! Are you crazy?

729
01:13:22,632 --> 01:13:23,874
I'm looking for my little sister.

730
01:13:23,934 --> 01:13:26,109
Have you seen a girl walking this way?

731
01:13:26,728 --> 01:13:27,729
Is she lost?

732
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:31,749
I think she's trying to walk to the hospital.
She's only four years old.

733
01:13:31,942 --> 01:13:33,632
Oh. I didn't see her. Did you??

734
01:13:34,486 --> 01:13:39,354
No. We just came from the hospital,
and there was no sign of a little girl on the road.

735
01:13:40,492 --> 01:13:42,077
Okay. Thanks.

736
01:13:42,869 --> 01:13:44,302
Wait. Where'd you say you're from?

737
01:13:44,604 --> 01:13:45,590
From Matsugo.

738
01:13:45,664 --> 01:13:47,207
Matsugo! Ho!

739
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,316
A four-year-old couldn't walk this far.

740
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:53,137
Good luck. I hope you find her.

741
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:05,081
Satsuki!

742
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,049
Kanta!

743
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:09,976
Find her?

744
01:14:10,001 --> 01:14:10,515
No.

745
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:11,968
I guess you didn't, either.

746
01:14:12,111 --> 01:14:12,920
Mmm-mmm.

747
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:15,478
My dad's got a bunch of people looking for her.

748
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,901
I could ride my bike to the hospital for you.

749
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:19,229
You should go back home.

750
01:14:19,284 --> 01:14:20,349
Check all around.

751
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:22,772
I'm sure that Mei got lost on her way to the hospital.

752
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:26,621
A little while ago, they found a sandal in the pond.

753
01:14:33,795 --> 01:14:36,326
They don't know for sure it's Mei's sandal!

754
01:14:53,565 --> 01:14:54,789
Did you find her yet?

755
01:15:19,299 --> 01:15:20,842
We'll check the irrigation ditch.

756
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:26,514
On the far end.

757
01:15:31,478 --> 01:15:34,606
It's much deeper over there. You should try there first!

758
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:36,166
Are there more poles?

759
01:15:46,785 --> 01:15:47,464
Huh?

760
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,289
It's Satsuki.

761
01:15:54,459 --> 01:15:56,544
Here. Is this Mei's?

762
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:06,954
It's not hers.

763
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:08,303
Oh!

764
01:16:13,089 --> 01:16:14,549
Ohh...

765
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,101
Oh, thank goodness.

766
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:22,994
I was positively certain that sandal belonged to Mei.

767
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:25,156
All right. Granny just got carried away.

768
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,909
Hey! It's not her sandal!

769
01:16:33,373 --> 01:16:37,744
All right everyone, I know you've spent a lot
of time here, but we still need your help.

770
01:16:48,054 --> 01:16:49,110
Satsuki!

771
01:17:04,864 --> 01:17:05,865
Please.

772
01:17:08,408 --> 01:17:10,785
Let me in to see Totoro. Mei's lost.

773
01:17:10,869 --> 01:17:13,371
It's getting dark, and she's out there all alone.

774
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:15,915
Please let me in to see him. It's an emergency.

775
01:17:46,744 --> 01:17:47,739
Totoro!

776
01:17:49,949 --> 01:17:54,076
Totoro, Mei's lost. I looked everywhere for
her, but I couldn't find her.

777
01:17:54,245 --> 01:17:56,600
Please help me. I have to find her.

778
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,352
I'm sure she's scared half to death by now.

779
01:18:01,085 --> 01:18:02,870
I don't know where else to turn.

780
01:19:02,349 --> 01:19:04,142
No one else can see it, can they?

781
01:19:34,067 --> 01:19:34,905
Huh?

782
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:53,031
FOREST-SWAMP

783
01:19:53,114 --> 01:19:56,534
CEMETERY-SHRINE

784
01:19:56,617 --> 01:19:57,618
MEI

785
01:19:57,702 --> 01:20:01,247
Mei.

786
01:20:16,554 --> 01:20:17,764
Mei!

787
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:19,891
Mei!

788
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:28,978
The trees are parting!

789
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:02,741
Mei!

790
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:08,532
Satsuki!

791
01:21:10,274 --> 01:21:12,551
Where are you?

792
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:13,427
Mei!

793
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:24,445
Mei!

794
01:21:24,542 --> 01:21:26,384
Satsuki!

795
01:21:28,334 --> 01:21:30,124
Oh! You're okay.

796
01:21:30,205 --> 01:21:31,551
I'm sorry.

797
01:21:34,298 --> 01:21:37,218
Were you trying to take your corn to Mom at the hospital?

798
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:38,269
Mmm-hmm.

799
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:46,540
HOSPITAL

800
01:21:49,814 --> 01:21:51,647
You're going to take us to the hospital?

801
01:21:54,485 --> 01:21:55,570
Thank you!

802
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:07,874
I'm sorry. I don't know why the hospital sent a telegram.

803
01:22:07,957 --> 01:22:09,357
It's just a cold.

804
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:14,449
I hope it didn't upset them too much.
I've caused enough grief already.

805
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:17,165
When they see you're all right, they'll be fine.

806
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:20,288
We'll just wait a little longer for a weekend together.

807
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:22,393
Don't worry. We've made it this far.

808
01:22:24,056 --> 01:22:27,351
The girls act so strong,
but I think it's harder than they let on.

809
01:22:27,435 --> 01:22:28,603
Especially Satsuki.

810
01:22:28,686 --> 01:22:30,682
She tries to act so adult.

811
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:32,849
That's true.

812
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:35,026
I can't wait until I get better.

813
01:22:35,109 --> 01:22:37,862
When I get home, I'm going to spoil the girls rotten.

814
01:22:46,204 --> 01:22:48,122
Look at Mom. She's laughing.

815
01:22:48,206 --> 01:22:49,710
Everything must be okay.

816
01:22:49,735 --> 01:22:50,384
Yeah.

817
01:22:58,716 --> 01:23:00,927
I'm going to hurry up and get well!

818
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:03,469
That's the spirit. Huh?

819
01:23:10,561 --> 01:23:11,748
Who left this?

820
01:23:13,981 --> 01:23:14,815
What is it?

821
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:19,237
I thought I saw Satsuki and Mei
smiling at us from up in that tree.

822
01:23:21,864 --> 01:23:23,908
It sounds crazy, but maybe you did.

823
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:24,748
Look at this.

824
01:23:25,043 --> 01:23:26,367
"For Mommy."

825
01:23:30,331 --> 01:23:32,905
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

826
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:36,702
<i>Totoro, Totoro</i>

827
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:49,216
<i>Who leaves the seeds</i>

828
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:52,609
<i>For you to find</i>

829
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:56,107
<i>Follow them and you will see</i>

830
01:23:56,190 --> 01:24:00,354
<i>A treasure there</i>

831
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:03,803
<i>Then plant the seeds</i>

832
01:24:04,365 --> 01:24:07,618
<i>And help them grow</i>

833
01:24:07,702 --> 01:24:10,501
<i>It may seem like a dream</i>

834
01:24:11,122 --> 01:24:14,448
<i>Things are not what they seem</i>

835
01:24:15,126 --> 01:24:18,212
<i>Now begins a new adventure</i>

836
01:24:18,237 --> 01:24:21,199
<i>For you!</i>

837
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:25,138
<i>And you'll be with To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

838
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:28,718
<i>To-to-ro! Totoro!</i>

839
01:24:29,904 --> 01:24:33,351
<i>Living in the forest trees,</i>

840
01:24:33,455 --> 01:24:36,481
<i>For such a very, very long time!</i>

841
01:24:36,545 --> 01:24:39,825
<i>There you'll be with To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

842
01:24:41,051 --> 01:24:43,592
<i>To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

843
01:24:44,699 --> 01:24:48,176
<i>You only see him when your very young,</i>

844
01:24:48,245 --> 01:24:52,771
<i>A magical adventure for you!</i>

845
01:24:53,074 --> 01:24:56,633
<i>It's magic for you.</i>

846
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:00,956
<i>Rain tumbles down...</i>

847
01:25:02,117 --> 01:25:04,776
<i>The bus is late.</i>

848
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:08,399
<i>Suddenly, a furry wet giant</i>

849
01:25:08,463 --> 01:25:12,198
<i>Is by your side!</i>

850
01:25:13,264 --> 01:25:15,430
<i>Don't be afraid...</i>

851
01:25:16,869 --> 01:25:20,247
<i>Just open wide!</i>

852
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:22,931
<i>Your umbrella for him,</i>

853
01:25:23,972 --> 01:25:26,650
<i>Watch him play in the rain!</i>

854
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:31,030
<i>Now begins a new adventure </i>

855
01:25:31,065 --> 01:25:33,623
<i>For you!</i>

856
01:25:34,299 --> 01:25:37,569
<i>And you'll be with To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

857
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:41,303
<i>To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

858
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:45,937
<i>And on a moonlit night,</i>

859
01:25:46,113 --> 01:25:49,030
<i>He plays a magic flute in the sky!</i>

860
01:25:49,173 --> 01:25:52,507
<i>There you'll be with To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

861
01:25:53,725 --> 01:25:56,463
<i>To-to-ro, Totoro!</i>

862
01:25:57,458 --> 01:26:00,861
<i>You only see him when your very young,</i>

863
01:26:01,052 --> 01:26:05,482
<i>A magical adventure for you!</i>

864
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,615
<i>It's magic for you.</i>
