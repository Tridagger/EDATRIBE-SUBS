1
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:21,041
Stop right there.

2
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,458
Shana.

3
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,083
Remember what I said?

4
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,625
It is impossible for me
to stand by your side

5
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,708
as long as you're
a Flame Haze.

6
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,375
Because you will never
stop condemning

7
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,166
the Crimson Denizens
for their nature!

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,166
They are treated as
if they don't belong.

9
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,166
You reject
their existence!

10
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,000
That is why I have chosen
to create their paradise.

11
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:43,416
I will take them to
Xanadu where they belong.

12
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
After they've departed,

13
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:48,625
the world of the humans will
be left in everlasting peace!

14
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,291
Why do you fight to
prevent that outcome?

15
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,333
Do you not realize

16
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,791
this is also the only way to
fulfill Yuji Sakai's desires?

17
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,625
I implore you,
do not stop me.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,708
[Music]

19
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,666
That's it?

20
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:53,500
You're telling me that's the
reason you can't be with me?

21
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,250
Those feelings.

22
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,500
The ones we shared.

23
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,625
Why can't you
believe in them?

24
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,000
Yuji.

25
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,500
Why?

26
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,041
Why?

27
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,041
Why?

28
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,750
I would've thought that

29
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,708
after living in the
human world for so long

30
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,708
you'd be better with
the ladies, master.

31
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,875
No, I didn't have
much luck with girls.

32
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,250
If you would be willing to offer
me a few pointers, General,

33
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,791
I'm all ears.

34
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,958
Unfortunately, I never had
much luck with 'em, either.

35
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,541
Ready, Wilhelmina?

36
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:57,583
I am, milady.

37
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,875
Master!

38
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,625
Throw me! Now!

39
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,916
The Psalm of
the Grand Order.

40
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,208
Yes!

41
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,875
And this is the
Treasure Tool, Chorde!

42
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:22,000
A projectile weapon that
carries an Unrestricted Spell.

43
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,708
I remember it well.

44
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,125
I have no idea how you got
your hands on the Psalm

45
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:29,250
but a lone projectile is
no threat to my plans.

46
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,416
What makes you think
I only have one?

47
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:39,750
It's over!

48
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,500
You must have
underestimated

49
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,208
how important this is to me.

50
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,375
Did you honestly believe

51
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,083
that I would leave
it so vulnerable?

52
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,750
Dontcha think you
should be helping her?

53
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,041
She's a big girl.

54
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,541
She can handle
that bonehead.

55
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,708
What the...?

56
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,666
Should I call the 'big girl'
to help you instead?

57
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Shut up.

58
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,833
It's probably one
of my old man's...

59
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,125
Well, hello Sale Habichtsburg!

60
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,875
I must say,
I'm beyond thrilled

61
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,500
that you could
join us for our

62
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,541
"It's time to pay your dues

63
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,708
and get your just
desserts" party!

64
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:49,875
Hang on to your
hat, Sale boy!

65
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:59,625
Huh?

66
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,916
Yes! Tremble in fear
and awe while your eyes

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
drink in the glory of the
ultimate "One-Hit Kill" weapon!

68
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:10,583
The miracle of science,
Excellent 252580!

69
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,875
The Ultimate Fist Circle!

70
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,250
Wonderful. I need a drink.

71
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,500
Yeah, make that two.

72
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,333
They certainly sound like

73
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,250
they're having a
blast out there.

74
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,500
Remind me why I'm stuck
inside this roach motel, again?

75
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,000
What did ya
expect, darlin'?

76
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,791
They're the decoys!

77
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,958
We're the ones with the real
job here, so no complaining.

78
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,250
Okay.

79
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,208
Don't give me that
mischievous grin.

80
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,708
If we wanna help our pals,

81
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:51,791
we have to do
our part, got it?

82
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,375
Yeah, yeah, but
it's still a drag.

83
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,833
I'd rather be drinking.

84
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,375
I didn't expect the girl
to be in the tower as well.

85
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,041
This could be a problem.

86
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,000
Ah. If she's useful to them
they'll keep her close

87
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,625
and make sure she's guarded.

88
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:07,750
Let's go.

89
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,625
Where did he come from?

90
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:40,541
No! Wait a second.

91
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,541
He's trying to bring
down the tower!

92
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,458
I'll take care of
this, Bel-Peol!

93
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,625
Stand back!

94
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,125
I guess it worked.

95
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,333
What a mess.

96
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,958
What happened?

97
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,041
Am I going to die?

98
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,750
No.

99
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,541
If that happens,

100
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,666
then there wasn't any
point in coming here.

101
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:48,666
Sydonay didn't want
Hecate to leave his side

102
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,916
but, in the end,
he let her go,

103
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
because he loved her.

104
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:59,916
I know Shana and Sakai
love each other.

105
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,708
But love is never as simple
as sharing the same path.

106
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,416
When you care that
deeply for someone,

107
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,458
sometimes you have to do things
that hurt them or yourself.

108
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,666
That's how it is
with everyone.

109
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,666
I mean, Pheles is doing
what Johann asked her,

110
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,375
even though it
pains her to do so.

111
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:23,458
And poor Johann is forced
to be separated from her.

112
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,916
Because they're
both in love.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,708
I think Pheles gave
me the Giralda

114
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,666
because she didn't
want me to use it!

115
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,833
But, if things continue
on their present course,

116
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,541
all that will remain
is sorrow!

117
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,833
I have to!

118
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,000
Shana!

119
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,875
Cut this for me!

120
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,041
Thanks a lot, Shana.

121
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,958
It's time to try it!

122
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,750
Kazumi.

123
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,625
They're trapped in a
fight they don't want.

124
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,666
I have the power
to change that.

125
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,208
By doing this, I could be
putting Sakai's life in danger.

126
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,958
It may even ruin whatever
Shana has planned, but...

127
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,708
I think it's for the best.

128
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,708
I feel like this is
the right thing to do.

129
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:29,666
For them, I'm willing
to throw my life away.

130
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,708
No.

131
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,416
I won't throw it away.

132
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,583
I'll make it
worth something!

133
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,250
I can hear you.

134
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,833
Your feelings are
so very strong.

135
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,541
I'm alive. Why?

136
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:14,125
The Giralda was created
as a means for humans

137
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,958
to use Unrestricted Spells.

138
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,958
You see,

139
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,333
humans cannot focus
on a single thought.

140
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:28,583
Concentration is key.

141
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,291
The chaos of your
mind inhibits you.

142
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,041
However, if you truly believe
you're sacrificing yourself,

143
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,750
your resolve can be used to
cast an Unrestricted Spell.

144
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,083
So I'm not gonna die?

145
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,333
Not today.

146
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,541
Did you give it to me

147
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,666
because you knew
this would happen?

148
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,166
No, quite the
opposite, in fact.

149
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,708
I never imagined that
you would try to use it.

150
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,583
But you did,

151
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:56,958
and your feelings created a
miracle which brought me here.

152
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
As we stand at this
crucial juncture,

153
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,750
I will change the path
that this battle follows.

154
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,000
Kazumi Yoshida.

155
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,500
You have done well.

156
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,583
Rest now, as I
grant your wish.

157
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,250
Pheles!

158
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,625
I am here to change the
course of this battle.

159
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,291
Though I dread it,

160
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:35,083
the time has come for me
to fulfill Johann's wish.

161
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:44,291
Pheles.

162
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,958
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,625
Let me help you!

164
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,458
No, I'm sorry.

165
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,291
Pheles!

166
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,416
I didn't think Yoshida

167
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,083
had the courage to
summon her here.

168
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,625
What?

169
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,833
I've got you.

170
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,916
Wake up, my beloved.

171
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,208
Hello.

172
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,500
It's good to see
you again, Yuji.

173
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,833
Or should I call you the
Snake of the Festival?

174
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,583
I'm leaving you now.

175
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,500
And I'll be taking
our Treasure Tool,

176
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,250
the Midnight Lost Child.

177
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,875
Yuji! Stay out of this!

178
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,291
If you were inside me,
as you claim to have been,

179
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,958
then you know what
Yuji Sakai is planning.

180
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,541
Are you opposed to it?

181
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,875
I suppose you
could say that.

182
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,416
I mean, I admire his
passion and his devotion,

183
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,583
but, I can't go
along with it.

184
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,083
Why is that?

185
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,958
I don't mind the means,
I just don't like the ends.

186
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,166
The ends?

187
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,208
Yes.

188
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,833
It seems to me

189
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:13,875
Yuji's getting the
short end of the stick.

190
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,500
Right?

191
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,416
While I think
it's a noble vow,

192
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,000
your little plan,
it's pretty boring.

193
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,458
In the end, everyone
winds up miserable.

194
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:23,958
Now tell me, where's
the fun in that?

195
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,125
You think this is
some sort of game?

196
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,208
I think you do.

197
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,750
And you've made it
nearly impossible

198
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,416
for anyone else to play.

199
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,750
The rules are too narrow;

200
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,833
"I did this,
so I have to do that".

201
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,583
You've left no
other options open.

202
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:38,958
There are none!

203
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,041
I'll do what I can then
accept my punishment.

204
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,458
It's narrow but necessary!

205
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:46,458
Is it also necessary to make
the girl you love unhappy?

206
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,625
If love is what inspired
your plan to begin with,

207
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,708
I think it's okay for you
to be a little selfish.

208
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,375
Shana would never go
along with my plan.

209
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,125
How can you be so sure?

210
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,625
You haven't even
told her about it.

211
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,875
You're so obsessed with
pursuing your goal,

212
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,666
you haven't paid any
attention to the person

213
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,791
that goal was meant
to benefit most.

214
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:12,833
If you mention it, I think
Shana might understand.

215
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,500
I cannot afford to
be that optimistic!

216
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,041
Revealing anything
at this point

217
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,916
could endanger
Xanadu's creation!

218
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,958
Are your plans
really that fragile?

219
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,208
Is it because you don't
trust those around you?

220
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
Or could it be...

221
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,041
That's it! Hah!

222
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,583
I have you figured out, Yuji!

223
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,791
Makes perfect sense,

224
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,125
you're underestimating love.

225
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,958
What did you say?

226
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,541
You tell yourself you can't
show her your feelings.

227
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,916
You use them as
an excuse, right?

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But all that does is
limit your own potential.

229
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,291
Love has the ability to
leave logic in the dust

230
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,916
and accomplish anything.

231
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
One just has to be brave
enough to trust in it.

232
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,416
That is nothing more
than your opinion.

233
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,416
But it's based
on experience.

234
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,958
You, on the other hand,

235
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,333
are throwing away everything
that brings you happiness,

236
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,750
all because you feel

237
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,541
you have to shoulder some
great burden on your own.

238
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,250
Do not pretend you understand
anything about me!

239
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,500
It's nothing more than
my opinion, remember?

240
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,750
It's all right, Johann.

241
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,375
And so is doing this.

242
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:23,708
I'll let you hold onto
it a little while longer.

243
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,208
What are you doing?

244
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,583
Isn't it obvious?

245
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,166
I'm changing your situation.

246
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,333
Pheles! Ready?

247
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,666
Yes!

248
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,375
I did it.

249
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,083
I did everything
you asked!

250
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,166
I didn't think I'd
be able to do it

251
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,291
but I tried my best for you.

252
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,791
Thank you, my beloved.

253
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,291
I'm sorry I put
you through that.

254
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,333
I promise no one will ever
come between us again.

255
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:54,500
Yes, I know, we'll
be together forever.

256
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:55,875
I love you, Johann.

257
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,666
Hurry it up!

258
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,791
Bye now!

259
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,083
Put the pedal to the metal!

260
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:29,333
You got it, Boss!

261
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,750
You'll be much safer
with them, Kazumi.

262
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,916
He didn't notice the bus

263
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
that flew into the
sky was an illusion;

264
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,208
the real one's headed
toward the surface.

265
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,541
That means.

266
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:47,083
Well, I could've used
her but that's okay.

267
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,625
Yuji!

268
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,000
Tell me.

269
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:52,708
Did you lose your
detection ability?

270
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,791
An effect of
Johann's departure?

271
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,250
Perhaps.

272
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,583
Does it matter?

273
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,291
How much could
it affect me?

274
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,041
What the...?

275
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,875
Do you normally greet
your guests this way?

276
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,875
Ah. Sorry for forcing
myself on you

277
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:34,250
but would you like an
escort for your escape?

278
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,958
I'd let a pack of
chimps escort us

279
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,750
if they had your
strength, old man!

280
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,666
I didn't expect the
Hyakki Yakou to show up.

281
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,916
So, the Mobilizer carved a
path for them to get inside.

282
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,500
But why would they
waste so much effort

283
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,000
just to recover that girl?

284
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,541
Who can say?

285
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,458
Whatever their motives, the
damage caused was substantial.

286
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,750
However, I doubt
it'll be anything

287
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,458
more than a minor setback.

288
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,541
Professor, how's the
tower's tuning coming along?

289
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,333
Splendidly, General!

290
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:08,208
We've just completed the
density calculations,

291
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,416
Now if only this
place wasn't so noisy!

292
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,333
Shut up, Domino!

293
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,083
You're going to ruin my
magnificent, climactic scene

294
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:17,458
with your incessant
babbling, you moron!

295
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,750
What do you have to
say for yourself?

296
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm so very
sorry, Professor!

297
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,583
How long until
we can use it?

298
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,208
Well, when do you
want to use it?

299
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,791
Right now?
Fine.

300
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,958
Sounds good!

301
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,416
Let's do this!

302
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,416
This isn't good, Professor!

303
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,791
The machinery's control room

304
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,791
is completely exposed
to the enemy!

305
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,000
I thought you
removed the monster

306
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,333
form control room functions

307
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,541
after the Strategist
scolded you...

308
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,083
Domino! Keeping
those functions

309
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:19,458
will add to the tower's
structural integrity!

310
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,333
Call it a "Noble
Self-Sacrifice!"

311
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,083
Sir.

312
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,875
If you want me to protect you,
please keep me informed.

313
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,291
-Can you do that?
-Yeah.

314
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,625
Sorry. Uh. Let's see.

315
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,208
Is it possible to
retract the control room?

316
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,750
I can do better than that!

317
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,750
Canopy close!

318
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,666
Give me a break.

319
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:51,833
This wasn't part
of the plan,

320
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,708
but I think we're
managing pretty well!

321
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,041
Taking out a single area

322
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:57,500
would be easier than
demolishing the whole tower!

323
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,541
Eventually we'll have to
destroy the entire thing anyway.

324
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,708
How about we just stick to
the plan we already had?

325
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,083
That sound good to you?

326
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,791
Hey, don't try to
put this on me.

327
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,375
I'm just along
for the ride.

328
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,708
Why do they keep fighting,

329
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,666
when they know they
can't advance?

330
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,333
I really couldn't
care less about

331
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,875
what those idiots are up to.

332
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:24,291
Soon we'll be in Xanadu and
we'll never see them again.

333
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,791
How strange.

334
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,625
What could they
possibly be planning?

335
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,708
How could this happen?

336
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,500
I've been rejected again.

337
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:47,541
[Music]

338
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:16,041
The battle over
Xanadu's creation

339
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,875
grows fiercer
with each breath,

340
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:20,791
as everyone puts their lives on
the line for their beliefs.

341
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,791
Meanwhile, Flieder
captures Rofocale

342
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,041
and presents him
with a bizarre request.

343
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:27,041
Next time on Shakugan
no Shana Final:

344
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,333
"The Egg of the World."
