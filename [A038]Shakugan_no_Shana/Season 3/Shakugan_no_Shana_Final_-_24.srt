1
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:08,833
Wilhelmina, Johann asked
me to give you a message.

2
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,625
"Please, my dear friend,
take care of him for us.

3
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,375
His name is Justus."

4
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,250
This child represents
the new way of being

5
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,125
that the God of
Guidance mentioned.

6
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:56,250
The Heir to Both Worlds.

7
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,708
When Johann realized

8
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,416
that he wouldn't
live much longer,

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,375
he suddenly had an idea.

10
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,458
There is one way that
we could overcome death.

11
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,208
A child.

12
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,916
A new life, Pheles,

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,041
one that we can
create together.

14
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:15,125
Then they knew,

15
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,833
this was the only way

16
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:19,208
they could continue
to live on together.

17
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,333
They joined both
their beings

18
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:22,833
to create a new life.

19
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:27,166
Dear Justus.

20
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,583
Beloved child.

21
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,708
Sweet boy.

22
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:34,041
Your parents
would be so proud.

23
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,166
Spiral Organ.

24
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,333
Was there sufficient
Power of Existence?

25
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,666
Yes, indeed.

26
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,166
There was more than enough
to activate the spell.

27
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,583
My work is done.

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,125
Now I understand.

29
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,958
The remaining Power of
Existence was your reward.

30
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:06,750
What'll you do with it?

31
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:17,333
Restore something special
that was once beyond repair.

32
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,708
Thanks a lot.

33
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,375
Before I go, I'd like to
leave you with a parting gift.

34
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,791
A little something

35
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,333
that will help to protect
your broken body.

36
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,333
Within that ring,

37
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:38,000
I've placed an incredibly
powerful Unrestricted Spell.

38
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,958
However, it will only activate
under certain conditions.

39
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:41,958
What conditions?

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,625
I have one last gift
for you, as well.

41
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,833
I shall name your
Unrestricted Spell,

42
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,791
Grammatica.

43
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,083
Explore the feelings
it brings to mind.

44
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,541
Grammatica?

45
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,750
You're such a silly boy.

46
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,041
We'll we meet again someday.

47
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,958
Till then.

48
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,416
Look, Wilhelmina.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,458
I think it'd be best for
the Heir to Both Worlds

50
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,166
to be raised in Xanadu.

51
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,958
You should probably
leave soon.

52
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,291
But I can't simply
leave you behind!

53
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Unacceptable.

54
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,458
Please, don't force
us to convince you.

55
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,000
You don't have much time.

56
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:34,291
The door to the new world
could vanish at any moment.

57
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,625
I can't.

58
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,916
If I go I can't help here.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,375
You have a new duty.

60
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:41,416
You must protect Justus.

61
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:46,291
Eventually the Denizens might
question Shaher's oracle,

62
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,750
and if that were to happen,

63
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,833
it could put the
child in danger.

64
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:52,000
That is why we need you.

65
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,333
You're not only capable
of raising this child

66
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,333
but you will help
him flourish.

67
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:59,041
Indeed, but still.

68
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,166
Everybody's ready to go!

69
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,791
Unfortunately, there were a
few we couldn't convince.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Hey guys! Up here!

71
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,500
I rounded up as many
of 'em as I could,

72
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,250
and I did pretty good!

73
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,333
They're a bunch of oddballs,

74
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:24,166
ready to charge
into the new world!

75
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,166
One thousand, two hundred,
twenty-five Flame Haze total!

76
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,791
We couldn't have done it if
Sophie hadn't prevented HQ

77
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,208
from figuring out our plans.

78
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,416
That's true.

79
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
We owe her for helpin'
us do one last thing

80
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,500
for the old man
and his great task.

81
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,958
Keisaku's outside the Seal

82
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:41,000
with an Outlaw observation team.

83
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,125
He ended up bein'
pretty useful.

84
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,458
That's my boy.

85
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,166
This is my old home.

86
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,916
It's where I grew up.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,125
It's the Heaven's
Road Palace.

88
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,583
You lived there?

89
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,291
Twelve hundred
Flame Haze, huh?

90
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,125
I suppose that's enough
to prove to the Denizens

91
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,500
that we will still be a
presence in the new world.

92
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,083
Well, it's not that we wanna
go after them or anything,

93
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,541
it's just that there's
no reason for us

94
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,875
to stick around here.

95
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,708
Allow us to take the lead.

96
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:12,750
Yeah, when you
put it that way,

97
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,666
we might as well
go along with you.

98
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,375
I believe that we
are powerful enough

99
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:18,791
to look after both worlds.

100
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,875
Please leave this to
us and go with them.

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,250
You have no need to worry.

102
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,916
The Chanter of Elegies
will remain here with us.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,875
Someone's gotta stay
and keep the Denizens

104
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,250
who didn't go to the
new world in line.

105
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,333
Gimme a break!

106
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,833
Even the Flame of Heaven

107
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,708
can see the chains of
love that bind you...

108
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,458
We'll see ya!

109
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,958
May we meet again at
the crossroads of fate!

110
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,250
You've still got time to
change your mind and come along.

111
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,916
You're just as
odd as any of 'em.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,833
You underestimate the
power of love, old pal.

113
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,250
Why do you think Chiara...

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,750
I wish you luck, Chanter.

115
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sure it'll all
work out for you.

116
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:25,958
You come out of a coma
with a boy on your arm

117
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,166
and you didn't bother
to give us the details?

118
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,541
Yeah, spill it!

119
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,500
Maybe Chiara can pick
up a few pointer...

120
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,250
Aw, that look on your
face is killin' me.

121
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,583
It's not like this is the
last time you're gonna see us!

122
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,166
We'll drink with
ya again someday!

123
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,708
I know, but...

124
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,958
Thank you for everything,
Wilhelmina.

125
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:11,541
I wouldn't be
here without you.

126
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,041
No, thank you.

127
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,458
For being such a
good friend, indeed.

128
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,833
Our gratitude.

129
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,791
Now on, he's your
purpose for existing.

130
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,916
Are you sure you can
handle that kind of burden?

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No kiddin', rug-rats
are a pain in the ass!

132
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,416
Indeed, I'm not doing
this because I have to

133
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,583
but because, I want to.

134
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,458
There's a distinct difference.

135
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,625
Unease persists.

136
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,208
Even so, I know
it's right for me

137
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,583
and it's what I want to do.

138
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,041
We'll leave him to you.

139
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,375
But before I go,

140
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,375
I have something
to say to you.

141
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,041
I wish you all the
luck in the world,

142
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,125
Flaming-Haired
Blazing-Eyed Hunter, Shana.

143
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,666
Yuji.

144
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,625
It's Sakai.

145
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,291
Time for our
final mission!

146
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,291
Now I want you to
be honest with me,

147
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:27,041
and tell me what
you really want!

148
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,333
I'd be glad to.

149
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,125
He's back to the old Yuji.

150
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,833
I want to use the massive
amount of Power of Existence

151
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,291
left behind by
the Denizens

152
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,875
to restore the damage
done to Misaki City.

153
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,416
Are you kiddin' me?

154
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,041
So that's his plan.

155
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,166
Is that possible?

156
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,041
It is.

157
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,916
You see, Lamies
left me this spell;

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,416
it's capable of restoring
that which is lost.

159
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,125
Death cannot be undone.

160
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:58,666
But.

161
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,333
It is possible to reverse
the loss of existence.

162
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,500
The things that we lost,

163
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,791
those the Denizens devoured.

164
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,250
They can be restored with
all this Power of Existence,

165
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,791
my Unrestricted
Spell, and...

166
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,833
The help of Yoshida,
who once tuned Misaki City.

167
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,291
You'll help me, won't you?

168
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,000
He's fast! Is that part
of his Unrestricted Spell?

169
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,458
It's doing something
completely different now!

170
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,958
Yuji, you plan to restore
your own existence, don't you?

171
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:37,333
No way, not me.

172
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,791
However, I'd like to
restore Yukari Hirai,

173
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,458
who is a part of you now.

174
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:49,500
But as long as you're
a core existence,

175
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,125
I'm unable to do that.

176
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,625
Shana, would you please
give her Torch back to me?

177
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,041
Since you took her existence,

178
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,750
if she is restored, my mom,
my dad, Ike, Ogata,

179
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,625
and everybody else
will forget you.

180
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,916
But...

181
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,416
She would be alive.

182
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,541
Then what happens?

183
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:17,000
What do you plan
to do after that?

184
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,583
That's all I want.

185
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,666
After that I'll go.

186
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,000
Off to Xanadu.

187
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,458
Do you plan to restore
the copy of Misaki City

188
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,708
once you get there?

189
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,750
That's impossible.

190
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,666
Though the new world
is a copy of this one,

191
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,500
there is no Misaki City.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,625
Don't you remember
what I told you before?

193
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,541
If I were to expand the
gaps within this city,

194
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,833
things would no longer
be able to connect;

195
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,791
they would sever from
their surroundings

196
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,791
and essentially
cease to exist.

197
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,208
You see, you can't copy
what doesn't exist.

198
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:55,416
Misaki City doesn't
exist there?

199
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,708
If that's the case,

200
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:59,833
then why're you in such a
hurry to get there, buddy?

201
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,958
Transform, Sydonay!

202
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,625
Well, Marcosias.

203
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,500
There's no point in
holdin' back now!

204
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:33,958
You got that right, my
short fuse, Margery Daw!

205
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,416
Restore it!

206
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,833
Sakai!

207
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,166
Please, Yoshida!

208
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,791
Do this for me!

209
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,625
The Seal's coming down!

210
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,250
You ready, Midget?

211
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,750
Go grab that
pain in the butt

212
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,291
and knock some
sense into him!

213
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,833
Then do whatever you
want with the kid!

214
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,416
Is that?

215
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,625
The Judge of Paradoxes'
Treasure Tool, Tartaros,

216
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,416
is protecting
the entire city!

217
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,916
I am going to Xanadu

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,250
where this place
doesn't exist!

219
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,833
I'll teach the Denizens
how to live with the humans

220
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,750
so that they won't
ever feed on them again!

221
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,291
Someone has to teach them!

222
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,625
There's a rule in place to
keep them from doing that!

223
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,083
I want humans and
Denizens to coexist,

224
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:13,583
and one rule won't
make that happen!

225
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,666
It isn't an
unrealistic goal.

226
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,041
The Denizens
have shown me

227
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,000
this is what they
want, as well.

228
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,000
After living with the humans
for thousands of years,

229
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,541
they finally began to
accept and respect them.

230
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,708
That's why they wished
for the same world!

231
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,416
When their paradise
was created

232
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,416
they were the ones who
made the request

233
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,833
to prohibit the
devouring of humans.

234
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,750
I will use the God of
Guidance's oracle

235
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,458
and the Heir to Both Worlds

236
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:45,583
to ensure they'll never
taste human flesh again!

237
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't care how many
centuries it may take me!

238
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,833
In a world
without this city?

239
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,541
That's right!

240
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,666
All alone?

241
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,666
That's right!

242
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,125
Everyone!

243
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,458
Look at me!

244
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,125
Remember me!

245
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:10,375
All I ask is that you
remember I was here,

246
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:12,500
even if it's only
in your dreams.

247
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,458
Don't forget me!

248
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:18,291
So he's afraid of
being forgotten.

249
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,083
Once I've accomplished
all of this

250
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,708
only then can I
walk with you.

251
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,208
In my mind, I
don't deserve to

252
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,875
until I've made
things right.

253
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,500
So please, help me
bring Hirai back.

254
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,458
You should have
just told me.

255
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,875
You should have
just told me!

256
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,750
It's Hirai's Torch!

257
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,208
-Shana.
-Shut up!

258
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,333
Shut up! Shut up!

259
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:10,458
I'm ready to walk
with you, Yuji!

260
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,041
Why must you wait when
you can be with me now?

261
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm sorry but I
don't have a choice.

262
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,500
After all, I've
taken so many lives.

263
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:28,708
Flame Haze,
Denizens, Humans.

264
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,541
I knew what I was
doing the entire time.

265
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,875
I want to be with you.

266
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,208
But I was so determined
to change your destiny,

267
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,583
to protect this city,

268
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,833
and protect the
people of this world.

269
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,750
I killed anyone
who got in my way!

270
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,166
That's why!

271
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,666
You've decided wandering
around alone in the new world

272
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,958
is your punishment?

273
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,541
If we were to go there
together I'd be happy,

274
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,416
and then there
would be no point!

275
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,375
It's only a punishment
if I lose everything!

276
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,458
Yuji Sakai.

277
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,375
You mustn't blame yourself.

278
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,458
Fine words from the
God of Atonement!

279
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,416
Another Unrestricted Spell?

280
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,375
It's an almighty type!

281
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,500
We can't resist it.

282
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,666
We'll cut through!

283
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,500
Why do you want to
fix everything alone?

284
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,208
I told you.
If I'm not alone,

285
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:44,208
it isn't a punishment!

286
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,541
But I could help you!

287
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,708
Why can't you get that
through your head!

288
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,500
I would do anything for you

289
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,250
so why won't you agree
to go with me, Yuji?

290
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:56,875
I can't do that!

291
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,458
Then that's it.

292
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,541
Prepare yourself.

293
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,833
I'll attack you with
everything I have!

294
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,916
Here goes, Marcosias!

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,250
Let's give him a rhyme
that he won't forget!

296
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,625
I'm all for it!

297
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,750
This is our chance to
take it to the limit!

298
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,583
Who killed cock robin?

299
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,958
I said the sparrow!

300
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,000
Who caught his blood?

301
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,125
I said the fish!

302
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,208
Who'll dig his grave?

303
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,291
I said the owl!

304
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,791
Who'll be chief mourner?

305
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,458
I said the dove!

306
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,708
All of the birds of the air

307
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,833
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing!

308
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,250
Damn it! How much
power is it gonna take

309
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,833
to finally kill
this guy off?

310
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,708
We gotta do this
for all the Flame Haze

311
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,958
this jerk's murdered!

312
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,666
When they heard the bell
toll for poor Cock Robin!

313
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,041
Aw, man!

314
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,458
I'm dyin' here.

315
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:31,416
Nah, he is.

316
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,083
What happened?

317
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,833
Did you allow them take
your life, General?

318
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,166
Yeah. I did.

319
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,416
Deep down I think
that's what I wanted.

320
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,666
I know the three of us
will be together again.

321
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,791
Four, don't forget
about the master.

322
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,333
We'll be reunited someday.

323
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:07,083
It makes perfect sense,
you are underestimating love!

324
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,041
If love is what
inspired your plan,

325
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,291
I think it's okay for you
to be a little selfish.

326
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,166
I forced my will
on everybody.

327
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,250
I can't simply let
go of all that guilt

328
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,208
for the sake of love.

329
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,500
It's all right.

330
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,000
I love you anyway.

331
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,833
I love you more
than anyone.

332
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,791
No matter what, if I
think you're in the wrong,

333
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,166
I'll stop you.

334
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,875
If you're suffering,
I'll be there to comfort you.

335
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,208
If you're worried,
I'll talk through it with you.

336
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:40,000
But you have to promise
you won't ever leave me.

337
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,250
Shana.

338
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,166
I know what you're
thinking, Yuji,

339
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,000
but I wanna know
what you're feeling.

340
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,625
Tell me.

341
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:51,041
I'm sure I'll do
things that hurt you.

342
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:53,541
But if I'm suffering
I want you there.

343
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,708
If I'm worried
I'll talk to you

344
00:21:55,791 --> 00:22:00,291
because all I ever
wanted is to be with you.

345
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,583
Same here.

346
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,750
Shana.

347
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:26,375
What's that?

348
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,500
I dunno.

349
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,541
Lamies gave it to me.

350
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,416
It's an Unrestricted
Spell I'm unfamiliar with.

351
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,791
You're not a Torch anymore.

352
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,208
You're a true existence.

353
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,541
I am?

354
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:45,833
I never thought I
could be so lucky.

355
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,041
I feel like I
can do anything!

356
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,125
Shall we go to Xanadu,
the new world?
