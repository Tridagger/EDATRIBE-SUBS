1
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,375
- Alastor: SHANA AND YOSHIDA

2
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:53,583
ATTEMPTED TO FIND COMMON GROUND
WITH PHELES.

3
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,750
BUT WHEN THE REAL PHELES
SHOWED UP,

4
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,416
THEY REALIZED
THEIR EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN.

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,583
SHE CALLED TO HER LOVER JOHAN
AND ASKED HIM TO COME TO HER.

6
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,583
HOWEVER, WHEN SHE DID,

7
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,875
A HAND CLAD IN SILVER ARMOR
REACHED OUT FROM WITHIN YUJI

8
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,541
AND IMPALED HER.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,125
- ( theme music playing )

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,625
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

11
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,458
- JO-- JOHAN.

12
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,083
- THERE'S AN ARM
COMING OUT OF ME.

13
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:11,000
WHAT THE HELL?

14
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:13,083
- ( coughing )

15
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:17,208
YOU, TELL ME,
WHO ARE YOU?!

16
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,791
I'M GETTING WEAK.

17
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,416
- IT'S DRAINING
HER POWER OF EXISTENCE.

18
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,250
- JOHAN.

19
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:42,291
- NO!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

20
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,000
- I-- I CAN'T,

21
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,875
NOT WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT HERE.

22
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,250
( screaming )

23
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,583
- ( growls )

24
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,750
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

25
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,708
- Marcosias: A POT OF BEER!

26
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,708
- Margery:
YOU'D BETTER STAY STILL
IF YOU DON'T WANNA DIE!

27
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,250
- Marcosias: NO NEED TO FREAK
OUT, PRINCESS.

28
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,083
WE'RE NOT ATTACKING
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

29
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,625
I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM
FOR SO MANY YEARS.

30
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,250
FINALLY, THIS IS THE MOMENT
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR.

31
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,875
- Marcosias:
THIS IS IT, MARGERY DAW!

32
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:42,083
SHOW HIM WHAT YOU GOT,
MY BELOVED HELL RAISER!

33
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,833
- DAMN STRAIGHT I WILL.

34
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,000
"WHERE IS YOUR MONEY?"
- I'VE FORGOT!

35
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,500
- AHHHH!

36
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,291
( screaming )

37
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,291
- PLEASE, PHELES,
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

38
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,208
- LET ME GO.

39
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:03,166
JOHAN!
- LISTEN TO ME!

40
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,875
- Taimat: SHE'S HYSTERICAL.

41
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,750
- ( weeping ) 
- PLEASE, I AM BEGGING YOU.

42
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,875
- JOHAN! ( weeping )

43
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,083
- Kazumi: SAKAI.

44
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,958
- ( panting )

45
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,958
NO, NOT AGAIN.

46
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:13,041
- ( grunting )

47
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,500
- YUJI!

48
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,541
- AHHHH!

49
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,083
- ( machinery humming )

50
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,250
- Fecor:
THE HEAD HAS DISAPPEARED.

51
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,125
AND THE LEFT ARM.

52
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,416
- IT WOULD SEEM WE'RE IN A BIT
OF A PICKLE, FECOR.

53
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,333
HE SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO TELEPORT, BUT LO AND BEHOLD!

54
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:26,833
- HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
- WELL, I COULDN'T TELL YOU,

55
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,458
BUT THE TAIMEI SHIHEN

56
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,416
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

57
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,041
- YOU THINK?

58
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,916
I THOUGHT WE WERE THE ONLY ONES
WHO COULD ACTIVATE IT.

59
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,500
- WE ARE.

60
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,375
AT LEAST, IN THEORY.

61
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,208
THERE IS
ONE OTHER POSSIBILITY.

62
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,625
- THE CREATOR
OF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

63
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,916
MUST BE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

64
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,166
- IS THAT THE CASE,
PROFESSOR?

65
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,083
- AHH!  THAT IS
A VERY DISTINCT POSSIBILITY.

66
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:07,500
- THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY?
BUT THAT'S A PROBLEM.

67
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:11,375
AREN'T ANY OF YOU WORRIED
THEY MIGHT FIND OUT
ABOUT OUR PLANS?

68
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:15,333
- NO, THE ARTIFICIAL VESSEL
HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE.

69
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,208
OUR CHARADE HAS GONE ON
LONG ENOUGH.

70
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,250
- ( screaming )

71
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,833
- Margery: I'VE GOT HIM! 
- Marcosias: ATTA GIRL!

72
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,958
- YUJI!
- Margery: HE'S SO STRONG.

73
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,208
BETTER MOVE FAST.
LISTEN UP, KID!

74
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,625
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED,
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

75
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,708
GRAB AS MANY OF THE SPELLS
AS YOU CAN

76
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,041
AND COMBINE THEM TOGETHER.

77
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,458
- ( grunting )

78
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,708
- THIS IS IT.

79
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,666
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
I'LL FINALLY GET MY REVENGE.

80
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,250
- KONOE?

81
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:22,125
- WHAT THE--
THEY SHOULD BE FROZEN.

82
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,958
- GREAT.
WHAT'S SHE UP TO?

83
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,250
- KONOE, WHAT THE--

84
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,208
( grunts )

85
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,041
- Sato:
WHAT THE HELL'S HAPPENING?

86
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,541
- NO.  KONOE.
YOU CAN'T BE--

87
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,250
- I ORDER YOU
TO WITHDRAW.

88
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:47,250
- AHHH AHH AHHH!

89
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,625
- RESEAL THE TREASURE TOOL.

90
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,500
- AHHHH!

91
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,958
- ( growling )

92
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:16,375
- MAGNESIA!
- Alastor: THAT'S FECOR'S
UNRESTRICTED SPELL!

93
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
IT'S DANGEROUS
TO BE OUT IN THIS STORM!

94
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,208
YOU NEED TO TAKE COVER!

95
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,083
- YUJI.

96
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,750
- WE HAVE TO FIND SHELTER.

97
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,291
- Alastor: FECOR,
THE TEMPESTUOUS CLAW.

98
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,500
- AND THE SUPREME THRONE,
HECATE!

99
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,708
- Margery: I NEVER IMAGINED
THOSE TWO WOULD SHOW UP.

100
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,166
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING
ABOUT THIS.

101
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,833
- Marcosias:
YEAH, YOU AND ME BOTH.

102
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,208
- YUJI!
- Alastor: SHANA, WAIT!

103
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,166
- I BEG OF YOU, PRIESTESS,
YOU MUST CAPTURE HIM.

104
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,958
- IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE.

105
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,541
- AHHHHH!

106
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,000
- PLEASE, HECATE.

107
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,125
WHAT--
WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT?

108
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,250
- AHHHH!

109
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,958
- Alastor: MAGNESIA
CREATES A PARTICLE STORM.

110
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,916
IT FORMS A NEARLY
IMPENETRABLE DEFENSIVE SHIELD.

111
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:34,333
- AHH!

112
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:37,750
- YOUR WORK IS DONE,
MY VESSEL.

113
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,500
OPEN YOURSELF,
RETURN TO ME.

114
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,666
- KONOE, NO.

115
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:54,083
- WHERE'D SHE GO?
- HOW DID SHE JUST DISAPPEAR?

116
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,625
THIS HAS GONE
FROM BAD TO WORSE!

117
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:59,333
- YOU RECOVERED THE FRAGMENT
OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS.

118
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,208
PLUS WE WERE ABLE
TO PREVENT THE SILVER
FROM MATERIALIZING

119
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,458
AND RESEAL
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

120
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,791
WHAT'S NEXT?

121
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,791
- WE DESTROY ITS MYSTES.

122
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,541
- OVER MY DEAD BODY!

123
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,666
- ( roaring )

124
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,833
- YUJI!

125
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,916
- ASTER!

126
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,041
- AH!

127
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,750
AHHHH!

128
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,500
- ( heartbeat )

129
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,500
- ( grunting )

130
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,625
- ASTER.

131
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,625
- AT LAST, I'M FREE!

132
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,333
- HUH?
- ( all gasping )

133
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,000
- PHELES, MY LOVE.

134
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,583
- OH, JOHAN!

135
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,958
- SORRY I KEPT YOU WAITING.

136
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,708
- IT'S FINE.
YOU'RE HERE NOW.

137
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:02,083
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I'VE MISSED YOU.

138
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,458
- I'VE MISSED YOU MORE.

139
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,416
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- IT'S TRUE.

140
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,583
- NO WAY.

141
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,125
- DAMN IT!
- ASTER.

142
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,833
- WHAT HAVE I
EVER DONE TO THEM?

143
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,375
ALL I WANT
IS TO BE WITH MY LOVE.

144
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,833
- YOU'RE FREE NOW.
LET'S GO.

145
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,291
- JOHAN.

146
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,250
- Johan: I'M SORRY.

147
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,333
- YUJI.  YUJI.

148
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,541
- Margery: WHERE'S SHE GOING? 
 - Marcosias: YOU GOT ME.

149
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,458
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH THESE YOUNGSTERS.

150
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,041
- NO.  JOHAN!

151
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,250
- STOP IT!  STOP IT!

152
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,250
YUJI'S GONNA DISAPPEAR!

153
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,416
AHH!

154
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,416
- WHAT SHALL WE DO?
- WE'LL TAKE OUR LEAVE.

155
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,416
- WHAT?
ARE YOU SURE, PRIESTESS?

156
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,666
- WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
EVERYTHING WE SET OUT TO DO.

157
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,625
THERE'S NO NEED
TO TAKE THIS ANY FURTHER.

158
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,666
- RIGHT.

159
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,500
THE POOR KID.

160
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,000
- Alastor: SHANA.  SHANA!

161
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,958
- ( gasps )

162
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,625
- YUJI!

163
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,083
- EASY.
YOU'RE HURTING ME, SHANA.

164
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,458
- YUJI.

165
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,416
YUJI!

166
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,375
- WHAT'S WRONG?

167
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,000
DON'T WORRY, I'M FINE.
SO PLEASE DON'T CRY, OKAY?

168
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:40,541
- Kazumi:
I WISH IT WAS ME UP THERE
HOLDING HIM.

169
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,041
- Sato: HEY, MAN.

170
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,166
YOU SURE
YOU'RE FEELIN' ALL RIGHT?

171
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,083
- Yuji: I'M COOL.

172
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,666
I'M STILL NOT TOO SURE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

173
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,500
BUT I'M GLAD
TO BE BACK TO MYSELF.

174
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,666
I GAVE PHELES A LOT OF POWER
OF EXISTENCE.

175
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,333
I'M PRETTY EXHAUSTED.

176
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:13,208
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I TOUCHED MY BELOVED JOHAN.

177
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,666
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

178
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,000
- NO, IT WON'T.
I KNOW THAT.

179
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,166
YOU SEE,
JOHAN ALREADY TOLD ME

180
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,416
THAT IT COULD
NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

181
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,708
ALSO HE ASKED ME
TO DO HIM A FAVOR.

182
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,500
I SHOULD BE GOING.

183
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,875
- Alastor: PHELES,
WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING US?

184
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:35,625
- I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T SAY ANY MORE.

185
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,000
IT WOULD PUT US IN DANGER.

186
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,041
- ARE YOU CERTAIN? 
- I AM.

187
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:44,083
YUJI, I'LL LEAVE YOU HERE
WITH THEM FOR NOW.

188
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,625
BUT I'LL BE BACK.

189
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,666
- Wilhelmina: PHELES,

190
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,375
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BEAR THIS ALONE.

191
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,708
I'LL HELP YOU.

192
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,291
- YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND,

193
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:57,458
BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO GET INVOLVED.

194
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,875
- I WANT TO HELP YOU.

195
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:01,666
- THANK YOU.

196
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,416
- HEY, WHERE'D THOSE LAZY BUMS
SATO AND SAKAI RUN OFF TO?

197
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,250
THOSE PUNKS.

198
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,250
- Yuji: I WONDER WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME NOW.

199
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,916
- I'M GOING TO PROTECT YUJI

200
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,875
NO MATTER WHAT.

201
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,333
- SO MANY STRANGE THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED LATELY.

202
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,166
THINK THINGS'LL
CALM DOWN NOW?

203
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,541
- HMM.

204
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:55,625
NO, WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN.

205
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,541
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

206
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,416
Yuji:
AFTER THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL,

207
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,208
OUR SCHOOL LIFE
GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL.

208
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,666
IT'S KIND OF STRANGE
THAT NONE OF OUR CLASSMATES

209
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,041
REMEMBER FUMINA KONOE.

210
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,708
BUT SOON, THE MEMORIES
OF OUR LOST FRIEND
BEGIN TO HAUNT US.

211
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:43,416
KAZUMI REVEALS
THAT SHE RECEIVED
A TREASURE TOOL FROM PHELES,

212
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,666
ONE THAT COULD
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

213
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,500
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

214
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,208
"EVERLASTING LOVE."
