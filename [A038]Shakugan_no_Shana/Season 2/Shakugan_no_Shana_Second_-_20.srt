1
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,291
- Alastor: YUJI WAS
CONFRONTED BY A JAEGER

2
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,833
FROM BAL MASQUE
NAMED ZAROVEE.

3
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:56,833
ONCE YUJI FIGURED OUT HIS PLAN,

4
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,958
HE ATTACKED
AND KILLED THE DENIZEN.

5
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,041
SHANA ARRIVED
IN THE NICK OF TIME,

6
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,708
DEFEATING ZAROVEE'S PARTNER,
THE WANDERER BIFRONS,

7
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:08,583
JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO FIRE.

8
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,375
- ( theme music playing )


9
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:50,041
- Yuji: ALL OF A SUDDEN,

10
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,125
THAT WEIRD FEELING'S
BACK AGAIN.

11
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,208
CAN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT NOW.

12
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:59,875
SHANA!  THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU.

13
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,125
- AH!

14
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,666
- WHOA!

15
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,166
- ( fire crackling )

16
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,416
- Yuji: WHAT HAPPENED?

17
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,291
AH!  AHHH!

18
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,458
WHO THE HELL IS HE?

19
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,541
WHOEVER HE IS,

20
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,291
HE'S A LOT STRONGER
THAN THOSE OTHER DENIZEN.

21
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,208
AND HE'S SO POWERFUL.

22
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:15,083
WHY DIDN'T I
SENSE HIS PRESENCE?

23
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,416
WHO ARE YOU?

24
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,625
- Wilhelmina:
HIS NAME IS SABRAC,
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE.

25
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,166
- WILHELMINA.
- HE IS THE CRIMSON LORD

26
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,708
WHO WORKS AS AN ASSASSIN
THAT I WARNED YOU ABOUT.

27
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:42,875
- Yuji: SO THIS IS THE GUY
WHO CAST THE SPELL.

28
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,291
- SOMEHOW I KNEW
YOU WOULD BE THE FIRST
TO STAND UP TO ME.

29
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:50,041
OUR PREVIOUS BATTLES
MUST HAVE TAUGHT YOU WELL.

30
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:54,083
YOU'RE THE ONLY FLAME HAZE
WHO'S PREPARED TO COUNTER 
MY ATTACK.

31
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,208
- SABRAC,
PREPARE TO BE DEFEATED

32
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,333
BY THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING,
WILHELMINA CARMEL.

33
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,166
- Tiamat: GET HIM!

34
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:17,291
- YOUR SKILLS
ARE AS IMPRESSIVE AS I REMEMBER.

35
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,958
IT IS A SHAME
YOU'RE ON MY LIST

36
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,166
OF THOSE I WAS SENT HERE
TO ASSASSINATE.

37
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,250
AND IT IS MY DUTY
TO SEE EVERY NAME

38
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,458
CROSSED OFF THAT LIST.

39
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,458
- WHOA!

40
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,041
- I MUST BE MORE CAREFUL.

41
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,583
I LOST A SWORD IN THAT STRIKE.

42
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:51,958
SHE IS A STRONG ADVERSARY,

43
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,083
BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE
FOR LOSING MY WEAPONRY.

44
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:58,916
I SHALL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE OUT 
FOR ANOTHER SWORD TO REPLACE IT.

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,041
I DOUBT IT WILL BE THE ONLY ONE
LOST DURING THIS BATTLE.

46
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,958
- AHHHH!

47
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,875
- THERE IS NO REASON
TO BE ALARMED.

48
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,666
- Tiamat:
 SO PLEASE STOP YELLING.

49
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,000
- IT VEXES ME
THAT YOU ARE STILL ABLE TO FIGHT

50
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:09,125
AFTER RECEIVING
SUCH A POWERFUL BLOW.

51
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:12,708
I HAVE FACED COUNTLESS ENEMIES
ON THE BATTLEFIELD,

52
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:16,625
BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
WHO TRULY MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL.

53
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,208
I WAS CONSERVING MY POWER
IN CASE

54
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,000
A MORE FORMIDABLE OPPONENT
APPEARED.

55
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,500
IT SEEMS THAT STRATEGY
WILL ONLY INHIBIT MY WORK HERE.

56
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,125
- WILHELMINA!

57
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,416
 YOUR-- YOUR WOUNDS--

58
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,041
- IT'S SABRAC'S
UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

59
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:38,291
STIGMA-- IT CAUSES
WOUNDS HE'S INFLICTED
TO WORSEN OVER TIME.

60
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,208
- BUT WHEN DID HE
EVEN HIT YOU?

61
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,666
AHHH!

62
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,333
- ( gasps )

63
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,875
- IT'S MY FAULT.

64
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,250
I'M SORRY.

65
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,208
YOU GOT HIT
TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

66
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,958
- PLEASE DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF.

67
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,250
THIS IS HOW SABRAC OPERATES.
- WHAT?

68
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,833
- IT'S ALL A PART
OF HIS PLAN.

69
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,416
- SHANA AND THE OTHERS.

70
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,833
GOOD.

71
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:20,250
I CAN STILL SENSE
EVERYONE'S PRESENCE.

72
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,458
THEY SEEM WEAK THOUGH.
PROBABLY FROM THAT BLAST.

73
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,791
- ( grunting )

74
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:37,875
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

75
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,125
 MARGERY.

76
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,125
- Marcosias: I WAS WONDERIN'
WHEN YOU'D WAKE UP, KID.

77
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,833
- MARCOSIAS.

78
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,666
- YOU'VE BEEN OUT COLD
FOR A WHILE.

79
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,708
THE BASTARD WHO ATTACKED US
SURE GOT US GOOD.

80
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:55,291
LOOKS LIKE MARGERY HERE
IS DOWN FOR THE COUNT. 

81
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,833
- I GOTTA WAKE HER.

82
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,208
- AW, COME ON, JUST SLAP HER!

83
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,541
- NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
I MEAN--

84
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,750
SHE'S WAKING UP.

85
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,583
- RISE AND SHINE,
SLEEPING BEAUTY.

86
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,875
 HOW'RE YOU FEELING,
MY DEAR MARGERY DAW?

87
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,208
- NOT TOO GREAT.

88
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,000
THAT ROSE-MADDER COLORED FLAME.

89
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,458
COULD IT BE?
- YEP-- SABRAC,
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE.

90
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,458
TURNS OUT
HE WAS USING THE JAEGER

91
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,291
AND THE WANDERER TO LURE US
INTO HIS TRAP.

92
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:35,000
- IT LOOKS LIKE SAKAI'S SAFE.

93
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,166
BUT HOW'RE SHANA
AND WILHELMINA? 

94
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,791
- I'M NOT SURE.

95
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:42,208
BUT I CAN STILL SENSE
THEIR PRESENCE. ( grunts )

96
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,000
- MARGERY!

97
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:50,666
- YOU'RE NOT LOOKIN' SO GOOD.

98
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,166
- IT'S SABRAC'S
DAMN UNRESTRICTED SPELL, STIGMA.

99
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,000
CAN'T GET WORSE THAN THIS.

100
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,916
- SAKAI.

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,541
- THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR AN ORDINARY HUMAN.

102
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,583
THIS TREASURE TOOL
ALLOWS YOU TO SUMMON ME.

103
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,833
- WHAT HAPPENED?!

104
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,708
SHANA?

105
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,500
- ALL THIS TIME

106
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:03,250
AND I'M STILL UNABLE
TO SENSE SABRAC'S PRESENCE.

107
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,250
- I COULDN'T EITHER.
SO WHY IS THAT?

108
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,833
- HE IS ONE OF THE FEW LORDS
WHO IS ABLE TO MASK IT.

109
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:13,041
THAT POWER ALLOWS HIM
TO ASSASSINATE HIS TARGETS

110
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,166
WITHOUT THEM EVER KNOWING
WHAT HIT THEM.

111
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,166
BACK THEN...

112
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,458
WHEN I WAS TRAVELING
WITH PHELES AND JOHAN...

113
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:36,458
I TRIED TO BE WARY
OF OUR SURROUNDINGS.

114
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,750
BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE
TO PREDICT SABRAC'S ATTACKS.

115
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,583
FINALLY,
AFTER YEARS OF PURSUING THEM...

116
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:51,416
HE INDEED AMBUSHED
THE ENGAGED LINK
WHILE I WAS AWAY

117
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,291
AND THEY BARELY ESCAPED
WITH THEIR LIVES.

118
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,750
HE DAZES HIS TARGETS
WITH A SURPRISE ATTACK,

119
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,041
THEN KILLS THEM
BEFORE THEY CAN FIGHT BACK.

120
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,916
THAT IS SABRAC'S...
- Tiamat: MODUS OPERANDI.

121
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,916
- IT'S QUITE SMART, REALLY.

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,583
INDEED IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO PREPARE FOR HIS ATTACKS,

123
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,333
WHICH LEAVES HIS TARGETS
AT AN EXTREME DISADVANTAGE.

124
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,833
IF THEY DON'T FALL
TO HIS SWORDS,

125
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,875
THEY'LL FALL
TO HIS UNRESTRICTED SPELL,
STIGMA.

126
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,166
IT'S HARD TO FIGHT
WHILE YOUR WOUNDS ARE WORSENING.

127
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,958
I WOULD KNOW AS I HAVE FOUGHT
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE
MANY TIMES BEFORE.

128
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:34,375
- THEN HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DEFEAT THIS GUY?

129
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,125
OH!

130
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,916
THIS WEIRD FEELING--

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,625
IT'S COMING
FROM DOWN THERE.

132
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,875
- WHERE'S SAKAI?

133
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,708
- Alastor: 
THERE'S NO NEED TO WORRY.

134
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,083
AS LONG AS HIS SEAL IS UP,
HE IS FINE.

135
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,541
- THAT'S GOOD.

136
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,250
BUT I WISH I COULD SEE HIM
FACE TO FACE.

137
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:33,250
I FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT I SAID TO HIM.

138
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,041
- PLEASE DON'T BE UPSET.

139
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,375
YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT YUJI.

140
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,291
YOU DID.
- YOU THINK SO?

141
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,416
- BUT NONE OF THAT
MATTERS ANYMORE.

142
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,625
'CAUSE HE'S FINALLY
BACK TO NORMAL.

143
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,625
- ARE YOU SURE?
- MM-HMM.

144
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,416
I JUST HOPE
HE'S SAFE OUT THERE.

145
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,958
I'M SURE WILHELMINA'S
LOOKING OUT FOR HIM.

146
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,416
- ( grunts )

147
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,541
- SHANA, ARE YOU OKAY?

148
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,125
- Yuji: HE NOT ONLY ATTACKS
WITH THAT WAVE OF FLAME,

149
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,000
HE'S GOT SWORDS
HIDING IN THERE?

150
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,833
SO HE'S MEGA-POWERFUL,
HE'S GOT THAT STIGMA SPELL,

151
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,875
AND WE'VE GOT
TO DODGE HIS BLADE ATTACKS?

152
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,833
THIS DOES NOT
SOUND TOO ENCOURAGING.

153
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,208
- THERE IS ONE THING
IN OUR FAVOR--

154
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,708
HIS ATTACKS MAY BE POWERFUL,
BUT THEY LACK VERSATILITY.

155
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

156
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,541
- HIS LARGE-SCALE
SURPRISE ATTACKS,

157
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,833
LIKE THE EXPLOSION
HE CAUSED BEFORE HE APPEARED,

158
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,750
ARE LIMITED TO A SINGLE USE.

159
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,666
- THEN THAT MEANS
EVEN IF HE WANTED TO,

160
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,666
HE COULDN'T USE THAT ATTACK
ON US AGAIN?

161
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,708
- ALTHOUGH SABRAC
HAS THE ABILITY

162
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:51,791
TO EXPAND HIS POWER
TO COVER A LARGE AREA,

163
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:54,958
 HE IS SO FOCUSED ON DEFEATING
THE OPPONENT IN FRONT OF HIM,

164
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,333
 I GUARANTEE
HE WILL NOT EVEN THINK

165
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,833
TO ATTEMPT
ANOTHER LARGE-SCALE ATTACK.

166
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,708
- OKAY, YOU'RE SAYING AS LONG
AS WE KEEP HIM ON OUR TAIL,

167
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,875
SHANA AND MARGERY
WILL BE SAFE.

168
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,916
- THAT IS INDEED
WHAT I'M SAYING.

169
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,791
- Tiamat: WE RISK OUR LIVES.

170
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,458
- AT SOME POINT,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

171
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,291
DO MORE
THAN DODGE HIS STRIKES.

172
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,875
IF ONLY WE COULD GET IN TOUCH
WITH THE OTHERS SOMEHOW.

173
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,875
BUT I LOST THE BOOKMARK
MARGERY GAVE ME
IN THE EXPLOSION.

174
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,500
- NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,
MINE IS GONE TOO.

175
00:15:20,583 --> 00:15:23,208
I BET HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

176
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,083
WILHELMINA!

177
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,375
AHH!

178
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,416
- Tiamat: APPROACH FROM ABOVE.

179
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,666
- COULD THAT EARLIER ATTACK
HAVE BEEN A FEINT?

180
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,541
- YOU GOT HIM!

181
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,791
- I KNEW THAT ALLOWING YOU
TO LIVE

182
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,208
WOULD ONE DAY
COME BACK TO HAUNT ME.

183
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,916
THOUGH YOU MAY PESTER ME,

184
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,625
YOU WILL NOT PREVENT ME
FROM COMPLETING THIS MISSION.

185
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,666
I AM AN ASSASSIN.
THERE IS NO STOPPING ME.

186
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,958
ONCE I HAVE FULFILLED MY DUTIES,

187
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,250
I WILL GLADLY DISPOSE
OF ALL OTHER NUISANCES.

188
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,458
- Wilhelmina: SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT WOULDN'T WORK.

189
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:30,125
SABRAC'S DEFENSE
IS IMPECCABLE.

190
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:33,208
INDEED ANOTHER REASON HE IS
SUCH A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT.

191
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,625
- THAT'S CRAZY.

192
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,500
 THIS GUY'S A MONSTER.

193
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,666
 I COULD HELP HER.

194
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,833
- DON'T DO ANYTHING STUPID.

195
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:55,333
- BUT I--
- IF YOU TRULY
WANT TO BE OF ASSISTANCE,

196
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:58,750
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT TASK.

197
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,500
- I DON'T GET IT.

198
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,083
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME KIND OF UNRESTRICTED SPELL

199
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,833
THAT CAN HEAL YOUR WOUNDS?

200
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,250
- I DO,
BUT THIS WOUND ISN'T ORDINARY.

201
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,916
- Marcosias:
 SHE ALREADY CAST
SOME COUNTER SPELLS,

202
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,166
BUT THEY DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE ANY EFFECT.

203
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,625
- KEISAKU, LET ME
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY

204
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:19,791
TO DRIVE HOME A POINT
I MADE EARLIER.

205
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:23,750
YOU WANNA HELP ME,
NO MATTER WHAT THE RISKS MAY BE.

206
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:27,375
YOU SAY
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR OUTLAW.

207
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,541
- UH, YEAH.

208
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,708
- WOULD YOU STILL WANT TO
IF I WERE TO DIE?

209
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,791
- LURING ME
INTO A NARROW ALLEYWAY

210
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,708
WILL DO NOTHING
TO LESSEN THE POWER
OF MY ATTACKS.

211
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,083
PERHAPS THIS IS WHERE
THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING

212
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,083
FANCIES
TAKING HER LAST BREATH.

213
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:02,000
AH, WELL,
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM
IN HUMORING HER.

214
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,833
DAMN.
I FELL FOR IT.

215
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,208
- AHHH!

216
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,375
- HOW IS IT
HE'S COMPLETELY UNSCATHED
AFTER THAT ATTACK?

217
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:55,750
 IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.
 - Tiamat: INCONCEIVABLE.

218
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,583
- PROBABILITY OF ILLUSION?
- NIL.

219
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,458
- IN ALL HONESTY,

220
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,083
I'M SURPRISED THIS ENCOUNTER
HAS LASTED SO LONG, SPECIALIST.

221
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,083
I LIED BEFORE.

222
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,708
YOUR LEVEL OF SKILL
HAS IMPROVED SINCE LAST WE MET,

223
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:14,458
THOUGH SEEMINGLY NOT ENOUGH
FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY DEFEAT ME.

224
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,375
- LET ME GUESS, SABRAC--

225
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,708
YOU USED THE JAEGER
AND WANDERER AS BAIT,

226
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,708
HOPING TO LURE
OUT THE FLAME HAZE.

227
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:23,375
- CORRECT.
I ASKED THE TRI-CLOPS WOMAN,

228
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:26,000
BEL-PEOL, TO SEND THEM
BEFORE MY ARRIVAL.

229
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,625
IT GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY
TO SEE WHO I WAS UP AGAINST.

230
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:31,791
THEY WERE MERELY A MEANS
TO AN END.

231
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,291
THERE WAS PART OF ME
THAT NAIVELY HOPED

232
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,208
THEY MIGHT FINISH THE JOB.

233
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,833
BUT THEIR INCOMPETENCE PROVED
TO BE THEIR ULTIMATE UNDOING.

234
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,500
- SO IT WAS BAL MASQUE
WHO HIRED HIM.

235
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,833
THEN HE'S AFTER--
- Tiamat: THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD.

236
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,291
- ( grunts )

237
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:23,791
- YOU'VE BECOME
A COMMENDABLE OPPONENT.

238
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,083
THIS JOB WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH EASIER

239
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:29,875
IF ONLY I HAD KILLED YOU
YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

240
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,791
MY OWN IMPATIENCE IS TO BLAME.

241
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,958
I SHOULD HAVE DEFEATED YOU
ONE BY ONE

242
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,583
INSTEAD OF TRYING
TO TAKE YOU ALL AT ONCE.

243
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:52,791
NOW THAT THE BOY HAS FALLEN
INTO MY HANDS,

244
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:55,416
I'M AT A LOSS
ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH HIM

245
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
WHILE IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.

246
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,250
YOUR QUESTION WAS AN ATTEMPT
TO DIVERT MY ATTENTION
AWAY FROM HIM.

247
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,625
WHERE IS HE?

248
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,750
- I'VE GOT TO THINK.

249
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,875
THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY
WE CAN DEFEAT SABRAC.

250
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,583
- HIS ATTACKS
LACK VERSATILITY.

251
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:37,708
HIS LARGE-SCALE SURPRISE ATTACKS
ARE LIMITED TO A SINGLE USE.

252
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,541
HE IS SO FOCUSED
ON DEFEATING THE OPPONENT
IN FRONT OF HIM.

253
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,000
SABRAC'S DEFENSE
IS IMPECCABLE.

254
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,166
- ( grunts )

255
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,583
THAT'S IT.

256
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:36,791
- YOU ARE WEAKENED,
APPROACHING YOUR INEVITABLE END.

257
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,625
SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING,

258
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:42,458
ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

259
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,166
- I DO NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH MORE I CAN TAKE.

260
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,750
- Tiamat: DO NOT LOSE HOPE.

261
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,291
- ( theme music playing )


262
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,333
- Yuji: WILHELMINA STRUGGLES
AGAINST A SEEMINGLY
INVINCIBLE VILLAIN.

263
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,208
SHANA AND I
ARE REUNITED

264
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,833
AND WE COME UP WITH A STRATEGY
TO DEFEAT SABRAC.

265
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,333
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

266
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:40,416
"COMBINED STRENGTH".
