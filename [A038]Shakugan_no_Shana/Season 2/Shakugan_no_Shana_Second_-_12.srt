1
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,833
- Alastor:
WHILE YUJI SAKAI AND HIS FRIENDS

2
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,333
WERE BUSY PREPARING
FOR THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL,

3
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,083
WILHELMINA WAS INVESTIGATING
PHELES AND JOHAN,

4
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,625
KNOWN AS THE ENGAGED LINK.

5
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,791
WHEN YUJI REVEALED
HE'D CAST A SILVER SEAL,

6
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,208
WILHELMINA MADE A PLEA
TO PHELES,

7
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:07,125
BUT TOO LATE, AS HER WIND HAS
ALREADY BLOWN INTO TOWN.

8
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,541
- ( theme music playing )

9
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,416
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,541
- ( wind howling )

11
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,583
- ( grunting )

12
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,250
- FEELS GOOD TO GET A LITTLE
TRAINING IN.  IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

13
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,666
- IF WE TAKE TOO MUCH TIME OFF,
YOU'LL LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS.

14
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,458
- Alastor: WITH YOUR TRAINING
LIMITED TO MANEUVERS,

15
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,750
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
WON'T SUSPECT ANYTHING.

16
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,083
- IS THERE A REASON WILHELMINA
DIDN'T JOIN US?

17
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,958
- YES, SHE'S BUSY INVESTIGATING
THE CAUSE OF YOUR SILVER FLAME.

18
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,625
I'M AFRAID THIS IS A MYSTERY

19
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,583
THAT WILL NOT BE EASY TO SOLVE,

20
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:37,791
BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT

21
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,750
THAT WILHELMINA CARMEL
IS UP TO THE TASK.

22
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,875
WE'LL LET HER BREAK THE NEWS
TO THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

23
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,875
- OKAY.

24
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,666
- I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME

25
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,833
WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION,

26
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,833
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

27
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:04,125
- BUT, SHANA.

28
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,166
I PROMISE.

29
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,958
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

30
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,458
AFTER ALL OUR WORK, I'M GLAD
THE FESTIVAL'S FINALLY STARTING.

31
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,583
( gasps )

32
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,958
- COME ON.  LET'S GO.

33
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:45,166
- HEY, SHANA.  WAIT UP!

34
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,916
- I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE ABLE
TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION

35
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,791
FROM THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
FOR LONG.

36
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,208
- Tiamat:
YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

37
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:59,916
- WE'RE GOING TO
NEED HER ASSISTANCE

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,958
IF PHELES COMES LOOKING
FOR THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

39
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,625
INDEED, SHOULD THE MYSTES
BE RELATED TO THE SILVER?

40
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,333
EVEN MORE SO.
- AGREED.

41
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:11,791
- AN ENCOUNTER WITH THE SILVER
IS WHAT PROMPTED HER

42
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:14,541
TO ENTER
INTO A FLAME HAZE CONTRACT.

43
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,833
I WONDER HOW SHE'LL RESPOND
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT.

44
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,000
- WE'LL BE CAREFUL.

45
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:48,500
- WILL YOU MAKE SURE
THE TENT'S TIED DOWN?

46
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,833
HOW COME THE FOOD
ISN'T HERE YET?

47
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,791
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE,
GET A MOVE ON!

48
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,416
- HAVE THEY FINISHED
BUILDING THE STAGE?

49
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,208
- HURRY!  WE DON'T HAVE LONG
TILL THE OPENING PARADE STARTS.

50
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,208
- Girl: WOW!
- ( crowd gasping )

51
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,708
- I LIKE YOUR DRESS
IT SUITS YOU.

52
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,750
- OH, DO YOU THINK SO?

53
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,083
WELL, I THINK YOU
LOOK VERY HANDSOME.

54
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,583
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D GO THAT FAR.

55
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,125
- AWWWW!  SHE'S SO CUTE.

56
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,208
- I THINK YOU'RE A SHOO-IN
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE, SHANA.

57
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,583
- YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.  I THINK
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD CHANCE

58
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,750
OF WINNING.
YOU'D BETTER START WORKING

59
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:30,375
ON YOUR ACCEPTANCE SPEECH NOW.
- WORK ON MY WHAT?

60
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,208
- YOUR SPEECH.  YOU GET TO SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

61
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,166
- LIKE IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
WANNA SAY TO SAKAI FOR INSTANCE,

62
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,708
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO DO IT.

63
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,916
- THIS IS MY CHANCE.

64
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,500
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO
FALL ASLEEP ON YOUR FEET THERE.

65
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,625
- I HAD TO PULL ANOTHER
ALL-NIGHTER YESTERDAY.

66
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:55,333
I'D TAKE A NAP, BUT THIS
COSTUME'S HARD TO MOVE IN.

67
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,291
- YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN SLEEP
WHEN THE FESTIVAL'S OVER.

68
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,041
- SO FUNNY I FORGOT TO LAUGH.

69
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,625
- POKE, POKE.

70
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,833
- HUH?  OH.

71
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,000
- I'M GLAD KAZUMI AND SHANA
ENDED UP WITH THOSE ROLES.

72
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,125
THEY LOOK GREAT, DON'T THEY?

73
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,625
- YEAH, NOT TOO BAD,
BUT I GOTTA SAY,

74
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,708
YOU WOULD'VE MADE A BETTER
DOROTHY OR JULIET.

75
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,958
- OH, STOP IT.
- NO, I WAS BEING SERIOUS.

76
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,958
HEY, SATO, DO YOU THINK
MARGERY'S GONNA SHOW UP

77
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,916
TO THE PARADE?
I SURE HOPE SO.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,291
- ( growls )

79
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,333
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA STAND THERE
STARING AT ME, AREN'T YOU?

80
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:44,916
- ( fireworks popping )

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,583
- Man over PA: WELCOME TO MISAKI
HIGH SCHOOL'S AUTUMN FESTIVAL.

82
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:49,750
- ( cheering )

83
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:01,625
- CHECK OUT THE GIRL DRESSED
AS ALICE IN WONDERLAND.

84
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,250
I BET SHE WINS.
- HEY, HOTTIE.

85
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,375
- ( laughing )

86
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,625
- ARE YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO WALK THE PARADE ROUTE?

87
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,708
IT'S LONG.
- I KNOW,

88
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,333
BUT I FEEL BETTER NOW
SO I'LL BE OKAY.

89
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,583
- Ogata: GUESS IKE'S THE ONLY
ONE WE GOTTA WORRY ABOUT.

90
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,250
THE PARADE ROUTE GOES ALL
THROUGH THE SHOPPING DISTRICT,

91
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,291
TO MISAKI STATION
AND THEN BACK AGAIN.

92
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,958
- WILL HE BE ABLE
TO WALK ALL THAT WAY?

93
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,250
- HECK, WILL HE BE ABLE
TO STAY ALIVE?

94
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,750
- It's time
for the opening parade.

95
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,750
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE WE GO, GUYS.

96
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,708
- LET'S HAVE
A GOOD TIME OUT THERE

97
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,500
AND TAKE HOME THE GRAND PRIZE.

98
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,375
- YEAH!

99
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,291
- KILL ME NOW.

100
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:45,250
- A BEAUTIFUL SEASON INDEED.
- Tiamat: THE FOLIAGE IS LOVELY.

101
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,916
- WE WERE JUST ADMIRING IT.
YOU CARE TO JOIN?

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,541
- SO YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE HERE?

103
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:01,208
- JEEZ, WHAT'S GOT
YOU ALL WOUND UP?

104
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,625
CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?
IT'LL CALM YOUR NERVES.

105
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,958
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

106
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,041
- JULIET IS SO PRETTY.
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE A MODEL.

107
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,916
- OH, LOOK HOW CUTE DOROTHY IS.
- ( laughing )

108
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,250
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT TIRED
OF WALKING YET, ARE YOU?

109
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,875
- NO, I'M FINE
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

110
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,833
- ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE IT THROUGH THIS, BUDDY?

111
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,625
- YEAH, IF YOU GET TIRED, IKE,

112
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,541
LET US KNOW AND WE CAN CARRY YOU
THE REST OF THE WAY.

113
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,208
- THANKS, BUT I'LL BE OKAY.
- Konoe: YOU GUYS CAN CARRY ME.

114
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,458
- OUR BOY'S GOT A TOUGH DECISION
AHEAD OF HIM.

115
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,833
I SURE WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE IN HIS SHOES.

116
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:46,791
- ( laughs )

117
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,916
- LOOKS LIKE MARGERY'S
NOT GONNA MAKE IT, HUH?

118
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,083
- SHE STARTED DRINKING AS SOON
AS SHE WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

119
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,916
SHE'S GOTTA BE PASSED OUT
BY NOW.

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,666
- TALKING ABOUT THE CHANTER--

121
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,166
I MEAN, ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT MARGERY?

122
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,291
- YEAH, SHE NO-SHOWED ON US.
- SHE'S HERE.

123
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,583
SHE CAME ALONG WITH WILHELMINA.
- HUH?

124
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,166
YEAH, SEE?  RIGHT THERE.

125
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,625
- SHE MADE IT.

126
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,833
- I'M NOT LEAVING YOUR SIDE

127
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,958
UNTIL YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW.

128
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,333
- THE INFORMATION ISN'T
ABOUT HIM EXCLUSIVELY.

129
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:29,208
- I SAID EVERYTHING.

130
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,458
- I THINK IT'S BEST WE WAIT.

131
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,250
I WOULD LIKE
THE FLAME OF HEAVEN,

132
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,333
THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER

133
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,291
AND THE MYSTES TO BE PRESENT

134
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,291
WHEN INDEED WE FINALLY
DISCUSS THE MATTER.

135
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:42,291
- Marcosias: WHY ARE YOU BEATING
AROUND THE BUSH?

136
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,458
- Tiamat: NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

137
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,708
- HOW LONG ARE WE TALKING?

138
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,500
- WHY DON'T WE MEET
WITH YOU TOMORROW NIGHT?

139
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,500
- Margery:
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

140
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,500
DID YOU BRING ME HERE JUST
TO TEASE ME WITH INFORMATION?

141
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,083
- NO, I BROUGHT YOU HERE

142
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,333
TO SHOW YOU INFORMATION
IS NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

143
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,250
- I'M SO TIRED.
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

144
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,458
- QUIT COMPLAINING
AND PERK UP, GUYS.

145
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,458
- YOU WANNA IMPRESS MARGERY,
DON'T YOU?

146
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,500
- IKE, THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO,
HEAR ME?

147
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,750
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO BOSSY.
- HEY!

148
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
I'M SORRY.

149
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,500
IT'S JUST THAT WE MAY NEVER HAVE
ANOTHER CHANCE TO WALK

150
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,833
IN A PARADE LIKE THIS AGAIN.

151
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,708
IT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT

152
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,541
AND I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE
THE MOST OF IT.

153
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,958
- OGATA'S RIGHT.

154
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,625
I MAY HAVE PROBLEMS,

155
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,083
BUT I'M GONNA FACE THEM.

156
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,791
I NEED TO MAKE THE MOST
OF EVERY MOMENT.

157
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,583
- ( laughing )

158
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,291
- YAY!

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,250
- Marcosias: THIS WAS A CHEAP
TRICK, SPECIALIST.

160
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,041
YOU KNEW DEEP DOWN MARGERY'S
A SOFTIE AND THE BEST WAY

161
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,458
TO GET AT HER IS TO TUG
AT HER HEARTSTRINGS-- OW!

162
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,416
- THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.

163
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,125
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I'LL GIVE
YOU UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT.

164
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,583
BUT I WANT EVERYTHING LAID OUT
ON THE TABLE.

165
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,791
NO SECRECY.  GOT ME?

166
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,916
- THANK YOU, CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

167
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,416
- THE PARADE HAS MADE IT BACK
TO CAMPUS.

168
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,833
- ( CHEERING )
- THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE ONE LAST

169
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,791
LAP AROUND THE FIELD.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO PICK

170
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,708
YOUR FAVORITE COSTUMES
TO NOMINATE FOR THE GRAND PRIZE.

171
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,708
- MAN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
SO EXHAUSTED.

172
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,666
- AT LEAST YOU'RE NOT COVERED
IN FUR LIKE ME.

173
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,208
- DO NOT EVEN GO THERE.

174
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,125
- ( sighs )

175
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,375
- CHECK OUT SAKAI.  HE DOESN'T
EVEN LOOK LIKE HE'S BEEN

176
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,875
FAZED BY ALL THIS WALKING.
GUY'S GOT SOME STAMINA.

177
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,833
- Yuji:
YOU ALL RIGHT, IKE?

178
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,708
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

179
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,750
- COOL.  I THINK I CAN WALK
THE LAST STRETCH ON MY OWN.

180
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,250
- ( shouting )

181
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,000
- YOU'RE THE CUTEST DOROTHY
I'VE EVER SEEN, SHANA.

182
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,500
- YOU LOOKED SO BEAUTIFUL
OUT THERE, KAZUMI.

183
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,791
- OUR CLASS IS SURE
TO WIN THE GRAND PRIZE.

184
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,875
- SAKAI, YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME
AS ROMEO.

185
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,541
I BET YOU'LL WIN FOR THE BOYS.

186
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,458
- EVERYBODY QUIT PUSHING.
I'M GETTING CRUSHED.

187
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:22,291
- HEY, YOU GUYS, IKE'S NOT
GOOD WITH CROWDS.

188
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,791
- I CAN'T HANDLE IT!
( sighs )

189
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,708
- ( all laughing )

190
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,416
- HERE, ONE BLUEBERRY CREPE.

191
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,458
- MAN, THIS SUCKS.  THEY GOT US
WORKING LIKE DOGS BACK HERE.

192
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,791
- I KNOW IT'S ROUGH, BUT
SOMEBODY HAD TO COVER FOR IKE

193
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,458
SO HE COULD GET SOME REST.

194
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,125
WE'RE RUNNING KIND OF
LOW ON BATTER.

195
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,666
CAN SOMEONE GET MORE?
- NO PROB.

196
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,583
I'LL BE BACK IN A SEC.

197
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,166
MARGERY.

198
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,375
- LOOK, I'M REALLY NOT IN THE
MOOD FOR THIS RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

199
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,083
- COME ON, LIVE A LITTLE.

200
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,125
- WILHELMINA, HI.
- YOU BROUGHT HER HERE?

201
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:50,291
- YOU MEAN A LOT TO THEM
AND THEY MEAN A LOT TO ME.

202
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,833
THIS WAY, EVERYONE'S HAPPY,
RIGHT?

203
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,416
AND TO BE HONEST, I WAS KIND OF
HOPING WE MIGHT GET THE CHANCE

204
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,125
TO HANG OUT TOGETHER.
- Shana: HERE.

205
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,250
- YOU MADE THIS FOR ME,
MILADY?

206
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,833
- YES, INDEED.

207
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,583
- IT IS DELICIOUS.

208
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:20,083
- ( sighs ) I'M GONNA GO.

209
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,875
- OH, NO.  WE'VE COMPLETELY
RUN OUT OF BATTER.

210
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:25,333
- ON IT.

211
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,541
- SORRY FOR THE WAIT,
BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE HIM LONG.

212
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:31,250
- WE APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE,
GUYS.

213
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,958
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HAVE A TASTE?

214
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,541
- IT'S TOO SWEET,

215
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,291
BUT...

216
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,125
I GUESS THE MESS
IS PART OF THE FUN.

217
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,708
- ( cheering )
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT THIS!

218
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,166
- UGH!

219
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,333
- ( cheering )
- NICE!

220
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,291
- Yuji: YOU FEELING
BETTER NOW, IKE?

221
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,333
- YEAH, I REALLY
NEEDED THAT NAP.

222
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,583
- I'M GONNA TAKE IT EASY
THE REST OF THE DAY,

223
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,041
THOUGH IT'S NICE
AND QUIET IN HERE.

224
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:57,625
- IKE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

225
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,666
EVERYBODY'S HOURS FOR
THE GYM ARE MIXED UP.

226
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,291
- ( groaning )

227
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,375
- HE CAN'T ESCAPE HER.
THE POOR GUY.

228
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,708
- IF I TRULY WANT TO BE CLOSE
TO HIM.

229
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,083
- IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL.

230
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,083
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART. 
IT'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

231
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,875
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS REACH OUT.

232
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:25,833
- UH, SAKAI?
- HUH?

233
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,500
IS IT ALL RIGHT
IF I WAIT FOR YOU?

234
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,625
- WHAT?

235
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,750
- WELL, I MEAN,
UNTIL YOU MAKE A DECISION.

236
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,666
MAYBE IT'S SELFISH OF ME,

237
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,833
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP
ON THE IDEA OF US.

238
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:46,875
I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE WITH YOU.

239
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:50,000
I WANT YOU TO LOVE ME

240
00:18:50,083 --> 00:18:51,875
THE WAY I LOVE YOU.

241
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:03,416
THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANNA GIVE UP
TILL YOU'VE MADE A DECISION.

242
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,416
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.

243
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,666
 - YEAH, THAT'S OKAY.

244
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,208
- Boy:
TESTING, ONE, TWO.

245
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,166
HELLO FROM
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL COMMITTEE.

246
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,791

00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,666

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,833
YUKARI HIRAI
AND KAZUMI YOSHIDA.

252
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,958
- THEY PICKED BOTH YUJI
AND THE MIDGET?

253
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,916
- LASTLY, FROM CLASS THREE,
TOSHIKO KURODA.

254
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,875
- Both: ALL RIGHT!

255
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,125
IF I CALLED YOUR NAME, PLEASE
CHANGE BACK INTO YOUR COSTUME

256
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,458
AND MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE STAGE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

257
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,750
- YOUR SPEECH, YOU GET TO
SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

258
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,958
LIKE IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU
WANNA SAY TO SAKAI FOR INSTANCE,

259
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,333
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO DO IT.

260
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:06,250
- THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO TELL HIM AGAIN, FOR REAL.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,041
I LOVE HIM.

262
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:19,125
- OH, NO, I'M GONNA BE
THE LAST ONE UP THERE.

263
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,083
- WAIT, DON'T FORGET
YOUR HAIR BOWS.

264
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,500
- ( wind howling )

265
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,375
- THAT WIND.

266
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,791
- CAN'T BELIEVE SAKAI
COULD WIN THIS.

267
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,333
HE'S NO ROMEO.
- RIGHT?

268
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,500
I FIGURED YOSHIDA WOULD,
BUT SAKAI WAS A LONG SHOT.

269
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,000
- GIVE HIM A BREAK,
HE WAS A GREAT ROMEO.

270
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,541
NOT TO MENTION HE WAS THE ONLY
GUY WHO MADE IT THROUGH

271
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,083
THE WHOLE PARADE UNSCATHED

272
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,541
AND HE HAD IKE ON HIS SHOULDER
HALF THE WAY.

273
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,583
- THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN
WAITING FOR.

274
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,875
FIRST UP, WE'LL ANNOUNCE
YOUR CHOICE

275
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,458

282
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,750
- All: YEAH!

283
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:26,291
- SHANA, WOULD YOU
PLEASE STEP FORWARD?

284
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,750
- WEIRD.  I'M NOT NERVOUS.

285
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,500
- WANNA SAY A FEW WORDS?

286
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,208
- YUJI!

287
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,625
- ( murmuring )

288
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:06,166
- I WANTED TO SAY...

289
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,916
- ( shouting )

290
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:17,875
- ( screaming )

291
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,166
- IT'S PHELES!

292
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,958
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

293
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,291
- Yuji: THE BUSY AUTUMN FESTIVAL
SCREECHES TO A HALT

294
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,958
WHEN PHELES ARRIVES
AND A SEAL IS CAST.

295
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,958
WILHELMINA TRIES TO STOP HER,

296
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,583
WHILE SHANA ATTEMPTS TO SAVE ME.

297
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:40,583
MARGERY GOES BERSERK WHEN SHE
CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE SILVER,

298
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:44,250
AND TANAKA WATCHES AS OGATA
DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLAMES.

299
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:53,000
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II"...

300
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:55,458
"CONVERGENCE, THEN AN OMEN."
