1
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,916
- Alastor: LIFE IN MISAKI CITY
SEEMED TO RETURN TO NORMAL.

2
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,125
BUT SHANA AND THE OTHERS
REMAINED CAUTIOUS,

3
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,916
KNOWING BALL MASQUE
COULD ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,333
KAZUMI YOSHIDA'S WORLD
WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN

5
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,250
WHEN PHELES GAVE HER
THE TREASURE TOOL, GIRALDA.

6
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,916
AND BALL MASQUE
CAME ONE STEP CLOSER

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,583
TO EXECUTING
THEIR FORMIDABLE PLANS.

8
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,125
- ( theme music playing )


9
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,666
- EH?

11
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,291
- Sydonay:
THE END OF THE DOREL PARTY.

12
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,333
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT'D BE THAT EASY

13
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:51,625
TO CRUSH
ONE OF OUTLAW'S MAIN POSTS.

14
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,625
I EXPECTED
MORE OF A FIGHT FROM SOMEONE
LIKE DOREL KUBELIK.

15
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,916
IF WE CAN DEFEAT THE PIPER
OF SORROWFUL DREAMS,

16
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,625
THEN I HAVE NO DOUBT
WE CAN TAKE 'EM ALL DOWN.

17
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,458
- Ike: WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT, OGATA?

18
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,750
- WELL, PLEASE TELL ME
IF YOU THINK I'M JUST
BEING SILLY,

19
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:25,375
BUT DO YOU FEEL
LIKE EVERYBODY'S BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGE LATELY?

20
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,750
- I DIDN'T THINK
ANYONE ELSE NOTICED.

21
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,625
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP.

22
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:36,250
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE I DON'T KNOW THEM ANYMORE.

23
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,500
IT'S LIKE
WE'RE ALL STRANGERS.

24
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,833
EXCEPT THAT'S NOT THE CASE
WITH YOU AND TANAKA.

25
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,583
- HUH?
- THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE GOTTEN CLOSER.

26
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,333
YOU'VE BEEN ATTACHED AT THE HIP
EVER SINCE THE FESTIVAL.

27
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,041
- YEAH.
( chuckles )

28
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,750
HEY, LOOK AT THE TIME.

29
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,708
THANKS FOR LISTENING
TO ME VENT.

30
00:04:56,791 --> 00:05:00,125
I REALLY NEEDED THAT.
- YOU HEADED TO PRACTICE?

31
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:04,458
- YEP, WE'VE GOT
AN IMPORTANT SCRIMMAGE GAME
AGAINST AMOAE NEXT FRIDAY.

32
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:08,208
HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD
SINCE I'M THE ONLY FRESHMAN
ON THE TEAM.

33
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,250
I'VE GOTTA IMPRESS 'EM!

34
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,250
- YOU SHOULD INVITE HIM.

35
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,208
INVITE TANAKA.

36
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,458
YOU KNOW, TO COME
AND WATCH YOUR GAME.

37
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,208
- I WILL.
GOOD IDEA, IKE.

38
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,000
- SATO.
HEY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

39
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:34,625
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
- NUH-UH.

40
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,583
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

41
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,166
WELL, I GOTTA JET.
I'LL CATCH YA LATER.

42
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,083
- ( door opens )

43
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,708
- Wilhelmina: I'VE COMBED
THROUGH ALL THE REPORTS.

44
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,166
WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ANY NEW INTELLIGENCE
REGARDING THE SILVER.

45
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,125
- Tiamat: NOT ONE LEAD.

46
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,875
- WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE
A SINGLE REPORT

47
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,125
CONTAINING
PERTINENT INFORMATION.

48
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,458
THIS KIND OF MISTAKE
IS UNLIKE THEM.

49
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,083
- AND WHO ARE THESE REPORTS
COMING FROM?

50
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,583
- Tiamat: OUTLAW.

51
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,916
- I WAS THOROUGH
IN MY DESCRIPTION

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,125
OF THE TYPE OF INTELLIGENCE
DESIRED,

53
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,791
BUT AS YET, WE HAVE RECEIVED
NOTHING PERTINENT.

54
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,875
NOTHING AT ALL.
- THEY ARE INCONSISTENT.

55
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:21,833
- Marcosias: YOU'D THINK
THEY WOULD'VE IMPROVED
OVER THE LAST CENTURY.

56
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,500
GUESS NOT.

57
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,500
- THEY HAVE IMPROVED.

58
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,708
I SUSPECT
THEY'RE HAVING PROBLEMS
WITHIN THE NETWORK.

59
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,500
- INTERESTING.

60
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,416
YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD,
KEISAKU?

61
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,916
I KNOW YOU'RE
OUT THERE EAVESDROPPING.

62
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,416
LET'S HEAR
WHAT EITA HAD TO SAY.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,833
- HE DIDN'T SAY MUCH.
I'M SORRY.

64
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,083
- HA!  SO HE'S STILL
UPSET WITH ME, IS HE?

65
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,041
OH, WELL, LET'S GIVE HIM
SOME TIME TO THINK.

66
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,125
HE'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO EVENTUALLY.

67
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,375
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

68
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:58,000
SO, UH, MARGERY?
- YEAH?

69
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:02,833
- I, UM, I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
MORE ABOUT OUTLAW.

70
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,666
I MEAN... NEVER MIND.

71
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,541
DAMN IT.

72
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,750
- Marcosias:
THAT WAS A COLD-HEARTED STARE
YOU GAVE HIM.

73
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,541
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING TOO HARD
ON THE KID, MY DEAR MARGERY?

74
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,000
- THOSE BOYS
ARE JUST CONFUSED.

75
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:24,458
THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH PATH
THEY WANT TO TAKE.

76
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:28,125
I DON'T WANT THEM
MAKING A DECISION LIKE THAT
HAPHAZARDLY.

77
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,375
IT'LL AFFECT
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

78
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,500
CALL IT TOUGH LOVE.

79
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,875
- THIS TREASURE TOOL
ALLOWS YOU TO SUMMON ME.

80
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:54,458
BUT IN DOING SO,

81
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,125
IT WILL CONSUME
ALL OF YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

82
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:03,500
- Kazumi: I KNOW MY FEELINGS
FOR SAKAI ARE REAL.

83
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,708
SO IF THIS
IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE

84
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:11,208
TO STAND BY
HIS SIDE FOREVER...

85
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:13,916
- Alastor: YUJI SAKAI,

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,583
AS OF THIS EVENING,
WE WILL BE ADVANCING
YOUR LEVEL OF TRAINING.

87
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,625
- I'M GONNA COME
AT YOU WITH 20 SWINGS.

88
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,166
YOU'LL HAVE TO DETERMINE
WHICH ONE IS COMING
AT FULL FORCE

89
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,791
AND THEN
SUCCESSFULLY BLOCK IT.

90
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,541
- ONE'S NOT ENOUGH.

92
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,458
YOU SHOULD INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF FULL-FORCE SWINGS.

93
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,250
- BUT, YUJI...

94
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,500
- Alastor: THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO BE COCKY, YOUNG MAN.

95
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,125
YOU'VE NOT YET MASTERED
WIELDING BLUTSAUGER.

96
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,250
DON'T GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF.

97
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,958
- NOW THAT BAL MASQUE
HAS IMPLANTED A TRANSMITTER
INSIDE OF ME,

98
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,541
I CAN'T RUN OR HIDE
FROM THEM ANYMORE.

99
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:49,041
BESIDES, IF THIS CITY
IS A MAELSTROM OF WARFARE
LIKE YOU SAID,

100
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,333
I'M IN DANGER.

101
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:54,458
I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO PROTECT MYSELF.

102
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:57,750
BUT I'LL TRY.
I HAVE TO, ALASTOR.

103
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,875
- MMM.

104
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,750
IT MAKES SENSE
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY.

105
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,208
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

106
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,250
HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS.
EN GARDE.

107
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,458
( grunting )

108
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,583
- YEAH SO?

109
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,541
WHY'D YOU DRAG ME
ALL THE WAY UP HERE?

110
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,250
- SORRY.  IT'S JUST,
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

111
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:51,750
- WELL, THEN YOU CAN ASK ME
BACK DOWN IN THE CLASSROOM.

112
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,916
- NO, THAT WON'T WORK.
SAKAI'S DOWN THERE.

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
OVERHEARING OUR CONVERSATION.

114
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:06,666
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME
MORE ABOUT OUTLAW?

115
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,125
- TANAKA.

116
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:16,083
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
- YOU BRING YOUR LUNCH TODAY?

117
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:20,000
- UH, NO.
I FORGOT IT AT HOME AGAIN.

118
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:24,083
I'D ASK YOU TO JOIN ME,
BUT YOU ALWAYS BRING YOURS.

119
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,250
- ACTUALLY,
I FORGOT MINE TOO.

120
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,875
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

121
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,958
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT FORGET YOURS
SO I LEFT MINE AT HOME.

122
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:37,500
HEY, TANAKA?
BE HONEST WITH ME.

123
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:40,166
YOU'VE BEEN FORGETTING
YOUR LUNCH ON PURPOSE, RIGHT?

124
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,291
- NO.
WHY'D YOU ASK?

125
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,416
- I GET THE FEELING

126
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,000
YOU'RE TRYING
TO DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM EVERYONE, EVEN SATO.

127
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,333
- TH-- THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

128
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,458
- THEN WHY'VE YOU BEEN ACTING
SO ALOOF LATELY?

129
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:57,583
EVEN WHEN IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME.

130
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:04,458
I WAS WONDERING,
WHAT'RE YOU UP TO NEXT FRIDAY?

131
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,000
TANAKA?
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?

132
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,125
- OF COURSE I AM.
FRIDAY SOUNDS GREAT.

133
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,125
I'LL TAKE YOU ANYWHERE
YOU WANNA GO, OKAY?

134
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,166
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

135
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,083
- FORGET IT.

136
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,708
- SOMETHING WRONG?

137
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,083
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU.

138
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,958
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

139
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,083
- WHAT'S OUTLAW?

140
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:50,000
- THEY'RE A NETWORK
THAT SUPPORTS FLAME HAZE.

141
00:11:50,083 --> 00:11:53,875
MARGERY'S MENTIONED THEM
TO US BEFORE.

142
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,208
THEY HAVE POSTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD

143
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,791
THAT ARE CONSTANTLY
EXCHANGING INFORMATION.

144
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,083
I FOUND OUT IT
ISN'T JUST FLAME HAZE
WHO WORK THERE.

145
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,083
EVIDENTLY THEY HIRE
PLENTY OF REGULAR PEOPLE TOO.

146
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,041
- WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH ME?

147
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,125
- DON'T YOU GET IT, DUDE?

148
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,333
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT
A WAY FOR US TO HELP.

149
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,708
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO FIGHT DENIZENS,

150
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,458
BUT AT LEAST
WE CAN DO SOMETHING USEFUL.

151
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:24,166
COME ON, MAN.
- I'M GLAD YOU FOUND THE PATH
YOU WANT TO TAKE IN LIFE.

152
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,833
BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME.

153
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,250
- ARE YOU GONNA MOPE AROUND
LIKE THIS FOREVER?

154
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:34,666
JEEZ, I THOUGHT
WE WERE IN THIS TOGETHER

155
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,458
AND NOW YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LEAVE ME BEHIND?

156
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,875
- HEADS UP!
- Girls: READY!

157
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,375
- YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

158
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:19,666
MAYBE I WAS
A LITTLE TOO HARD ON HIM.

159
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,166
- Girl: OGATA!

160
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,416
- ( grunts )
- KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL.

161
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,916
YOU BETTER NOT
SPACE OUT TOMORROW.

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,458
- I WON'T, SORRY!

163
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,166
- Wilhelmina: IRRELEVANT.

164
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,958
IRRELEVANT.

165
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,125
AH.  THIS ONE CONTAINS
PERTINENT INFORMATION.

166
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,875
HOWEVER,
THESE TWO DO NOT.

167
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,416
I AM SURPRISED
BY THE LACKLUSTER REPORTS

168
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,708
SENT FROM OUTLAW RECENTLY.

169
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,125
IT'S AS IF
THEY'VE BEEN THROWN TOGETHER
WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT.

170
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,083
- Tiamat: COMPLETELY GENERIC.

171
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,875
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

172
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,708
YOU STILL HAVEN'T FOUND
A SHRED OF USEFUL INFORMATION

173
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,041
ON THE SPELL SEALED
WITHIN THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD?
- NO.

174
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,125
- IF IT WAS ABLE
TO AFFECT BOTH JOHAN
AND THE KEEPER,

175
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,333
THEN IT MUST BE
A POWERFUL SPELL.

176
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,958
- IT IS NOT THE SPELL
THAT SHOULD BE WORRYING YOU.

177
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,791
YOU SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED
WITH THE POSSIBILITY

178
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:15,250
OF COMING FACE TO FACE
WITH THE SPELL'S CASTER, SABRAC.

179
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,083
- SABRAC.

180
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,916
HE'S AN ASSASSIN
IN THE CRIMSON WORLD, RIGHT?

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,750
- WE KNOW HE HAS AN ATTACHMENT
TO THE TREASURE TOOL.

182
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,166
I WOULD SAY AN EVENTUAL MEETING
WITH HIM IS INEVITABLE.

183
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,125
WE'VE YET TO RECEIVE NEWS
OF ANY SIGHTINGS OF HIM
IN MISAKI CITY.

184
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,208
THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE
HE'S HIDING SOMEWHERE,

185
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,416
PLOTTING HIS ATTACK. 
 - IS HE REALLY THAT DANGEROUS?

186
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,000
- HE IS INDEED.
HE'S THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE,

187
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,250
ONE OF THE CRIMSON WORLD'S
STRONGEST LORDS.

188
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,541
HE'S NOT CONNECTED
TO ANY ORGANIZATION,

189
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,666
BUT IS HIRED BY THEM
AS AN ASSASSIN.

190
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,708
- Tiamat: OUR NEMESIS.
 - Wilhelmina: AT ONE POINT,

191
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,833
I ALMOST FELL VICTIM TO HIM.

192
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,583
- WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

193
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:26,458
- IF PHELES AND JOHAN
HADN'T SHOWN UP WHEN THEY DID,

194
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:28,333
I'D BE...

195
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:32,041
- SO THAT'S WHY YOU AND PHELES
BECAME SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.

196
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,750
- BEFORE THAT FATEFUL DAY,

197
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,875
WE HAD TRAVELED TOGETHER
FOR YEARS,

198
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,833
ALWAYS PROTECTING EACH OTHER.

199
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,666
WHENEVER
SABRAC WOULD ATTACK US,

200
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,583
I WOULD DISTRACT HIM
WITH MY RIBBONS

201
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:44,541
AND THEN
PHELES WOULD BLOW HIM AWAY.

202
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:47,500
BUT ONE DAY,
SABRAC ATTACKED OUR CAMP

203
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,625
WHILE I WAS AWAY
AND MORTALLY WOUNDED JOHAN.

204
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:54,291
PHELES SAVED HIM
THE ONLY WAY SHE KNEW HOW.

205
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,375
- Yuji: SABRAC,
THE DESTRUCTIVE BLADE,

206
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:02,208
A DENIZEN POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO ALMOST KILL WILHELMINA,

207
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,166
IS COMING FOR ME.

208
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,708
- WHAT IS THIS?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

209
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,791
- DID YOU FIND NEW INFORMATION?

210
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,625
- WHAT, WILHELMINA?

211
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,958
- MARGERY,

212
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:21,625
DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

213
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,458
IT'S ABOUT OUTLAW.

214
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,416
I'D LIKE TO GO
WORK WITH THEM.

215
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,375
I KNOW I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH
TO FIGHT DENIZENS,

216
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,625
SO I CAN'T BE
ON THE FRONT LINES.

217
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,000
BUT AT LEAST I'D BE ABLE
TO HELP.

218
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,291
- THE SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING
WAS JUST HERE WITH NEWS.

219
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,125
IT SEEMS
ONE OF OUTLAW'S MAIN POSTS

220
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,416
WAS ATTACKED BY DENIZENS.

221
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
- Marcosias:
IT WAS IN SWITZERLAND,

222
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,666
RUN BY A GUY
NAMED DOREL KUBELIK.

223
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,750
EVERYONE WHO WORKED THERE
WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED,

224
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:54,041
INCLUDING DOREL HIMSELF.

225
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:58,708
THEY KILLED FLAME HAZE
AND HUMANS.
 - NO WAY.

226
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,708
- APPARENTLY OTHERS HAVE
BEEN ATTACKED AS WELL.

227
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,083
DAMAGE REPORTS
AND S.O.S. CALLS
HAVE BEEN COMING IN

228
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,750
FROM OUTLAW POSTS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

229
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,083
- EXPLAINS WHY THE REPORTS
HAVE BEEN SUCH A MESS.

230
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,416
YEAH, SO I'M GUESSING
THAT WASN'T EXACTLY

231
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,750
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR,
WAS IT?

232
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,541
YOU STILL WANT TO WORK
FOR OUTLAW NOW?

233
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:37,083
- IKE, WHAT'S UP?
- YOU'RE GOING, AREN'T YOU?

234
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:38,333
- HUH?

235
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,958
- OGATA'S GAME
THIS AFTERNOON.

236
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,500
SHE SAID
SHE WAS GONNA ASK YOU.

237
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,208
- HA!

238
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,791
- ( whistle blows )

239
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,458
- TANAKA. 
- ( whistle blows )

240
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,541
- ( grunts )
- ( whistle blows )

241
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,791
- YEAH!

242
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,541
( laughs )

243
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,958
- ( whistle blows )

244
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,875
- Girl: YOU GOT THIS, OGATA!

245
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,916
- ( whistle blows )

246
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,541
( whistle blows )

247
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,541
( whistle blows )

248
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,875
- GOT IT!

249
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,875
- ( stick strikes ) 
- ( grunting )

250
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,541
- Alastor:
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T READY.

251
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,625
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE AGREED
TO ADVANCE YOUR TRAINING LEVEL.

252
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,583
- BUT I CAN FEEL IT.

253
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,750
I CAN FEEL HER INTENT TO KILL.

254
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,208
I'VE ALMOST GOT IT.

255
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,791
- ALL RIGHT, YUJI.
THEN LET'S GO AGAIN.

256
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,916
- ALL OF HER SWINGS ARE STRONG,

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,375
BUT ONE HAS MORE POWER
OF EXISTENCE BEHIND IT.

258
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:22,125
SHE CONCENTRATES THAT POWER,
MAKING HER SWING DEADLIER.

259
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,625
THIS IS IT!

260
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,041
- DON'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN.

261
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,958
- NO JOKE.
LESSON LEARNED.

262
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,083
- Alastor:
MMM.  I MUST SAY I'M IMPRESSED.

263
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,666
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN HER SWINGS.

264
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,208
WELL DONE.  I THINK
WE SHOULD CALL IT A NIGHT.

265
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,875
- NOT YET.

266
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:52,250
I'M JUST NOW STARTING
TO GET THE HANG OF IT.

267
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,750
KEEP GOING, PLEASE.

268
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,916
- YUJI.

269
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,083
- Sato: 
THIS BETTER BE GOOD, MAN.
IT'S PRETTY LATE.

270
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:10,541
- I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

271
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:15,000
- YOU SERIOUSLY
DID NOT GET ME OUT OF BED
JUST FOR THIS, DID YOU?

272
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,666
DAMN.
CHILLY OUT HERE.

273
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,875
COME ON,
LET'S GO BACK TO MY PLACE

274
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:23,541
AND TALK IT OUT THERE.
- I'M NOT GOING TO YOUR HOUSE.

275
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,583
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO SEE MARGERY.

276
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,666
- SHE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
SHE REALLY IS.

277
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,708
SHE DOESN'T ACT LIKE IT,
BUT SHE DOES CARE.

278
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,000
- YOU BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT.

279
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,500
BUT I DON'T EVER
WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN.

280
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,041
I WENT TO OGATA'S
VOLLEYBALL GAME TODAY.

281
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,916
SHE WAS KICKING ASS,
FOR REAL.

282
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,458
WHILE I WAS WATCHING
HER ON THE COURT,

283
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,791
I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
THAT DAY.

284
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,208
I'M SCARRED FOR LIFE
'CAUSE OF IT.

285
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,375
IN THE BEGINNING,

286
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,791
I WAS INTO THE IDEA
OF FOLLOWING MARGERY.

287
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,041
BUT AFTER WHAT SHE DID,
I JUST CAN'T.

288
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,125
- I UNDERSTAND.

289
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,916
I'M GLAD YOU FOUND THE PATH

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,791
THAT YOU WANT TO TAKE IN LIFE.

291
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,208
- THANKS, SATO.

292
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,166
( sobbing )

293
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:24,583
- AW, CUT IT OUT.
BE A MAN, WOULD YA?

294
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,500
IN ALL HONESTY, I'VE BEEN
HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS MYSELF.

295
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,125
EVIDENTLY,
WORKING AT OUTLAW

296
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:35,291
IS A LOT MORE DANGEROUS
THAN I THOUGHT IT'D BE.

297
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,833
BUT, HEY,
I'VE ALREADY MADE MY DECISION.

298
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,875
I'D FEEL
LIKE A COMPLETE LOSER

299
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,875
IF I DIDN'T
FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT.
YOU KNOW?

300
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:50,708
- HERE, TAKE THIS.
GIVE IT BACK TO MARGERY.

301
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:12,000
YOU CAN TELL HER
SHE WAS RIGHT.

302
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,333
I AM THE TWERP
SHE THOUGHT I WAS.

303
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,083
I'M JUST A GOOD FOR NOTHING,
WHINY COWARD.

304
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,791
- NO, BUT YOU'RE BEING STUPID.

305
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,500
TODAY'S THE DAY
YOU STOPPED BEING A COWARD.

306
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,416
- ( theme music playing )


307
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,166
- Yuji:
NOW THAT THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL
IS OVER

308
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,416
AND LIFE'S RETURNED TO NORMAL,

309
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,833
I'M DEVOTING
ALL OF MY FREE TIME
TO TRAINING WITH BLUTSAUGER.

310
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:38,500
SHANA'S WORRIED
THAT I MIGHT BE OVERDOING IT,

311
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,583
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

312
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,041
MY TRAINING WILL BE TESTED

313
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:45,333
WHEN A DENIZEN NAMED ZAROVEE
COMES TO MISAKI CITY.

314
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,041
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

315
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,208
"COMPLICATED YUJI."
