1
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:52,208
- Alastor: AFTER LEARNING
HIS MOTHER IS WITH CHILD,

2
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,958
YUJI IS MORE DETERMINED
THAN EVER

3
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,125
TO PROTECT MISAKI CITY
AND ITS CITIZENS.

4
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:59,333
SHANA AND KAZUMI
DECIDED TO END

5
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:02,125
THEIR LONGSTANDING
RIVALRY FOR YUJI'S HEART.

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,791
AS YUJI MADE HIS WAY
TO MEET THE GIRL HE CHOSE,

7
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:08,583
HE WAS AMBUSHED
BY THE SUPREME THRONE, HECATE.

8
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:10,708
- ( theme music playing )


9
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,916
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,208
- ( grunts )

11
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:00,958
SHE TOOK
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

12
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,166
- WE FINALLY GOT OUR HANDS
ON THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD, SIR!

13
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,666
- MMM?

14
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,250
( laughs ) WHY DO YOU
SOUND SO SURPRISED?

15
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,875
IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME,
DOMINO!

16
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,125
- YES, SIR!
- THAT FOOLISH MYSTES

17
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,958
COULD NEVER
THWART OUR PERFECTLY LAID PLANS.

18
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,333
NO!
NOT ONLY WERE WE ABLE

19
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:50,083
TO ATTACH A TRANSMITTER
TO THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

20
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,083
WHICH LED US TO HIM,

21
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:56,083
BUT WE ALSO FOUND A WAY
TO DISENGAGE THE KEEPER

22
00:04:56,166 --> 00:05:00,166
THAT THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY
PLACED ON THE TREASURE TOOL!

23
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,333
WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS!

24
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,916
AS THEY SAY,
"PERFECT PLANNING

25
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,041
PREVENTS
PISS-POOR PERFORMANCE."

26
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,500
AND WE COULDN'T HAVE
PLANNED MORE PERFECTLY.

27
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,208
IT'S ALMOST BEEN TOO EASY!

28
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,541
I'VE BEGUN
TO LONG FOR CONFLICT

29
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,208
SOLELY BECAUSE
IT BREEDS SUSPENSE.

30
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,833
LET US BREATHE LIFE
INTO THIS SLEEPING GIANT

31
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,583
SO THAT I MAY ONCE AGAIN
FEEL THE THRILL

32
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,333
OF ANTICIPATION!

33
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:40,250
- Hecate: BECOME THE HEART
OF THE BEAST.

34
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,250
- ( heartbeat )

35
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,708
- ( engine whirring )

36
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:03,583
- AWAKEN.

37
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,708
- AHA HA HA!

38
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,875
- WHAT IS THAT?

39
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,333
- Alastor: UNBELIEVABLE.

40
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,458
- IT'S NOT A SEAL, IS IT?

41
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,708
- Alastor: NO.
BUT IT IS SIMILAR

42
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,708
IN THE SENSE
THAT HUMANS CAN'T SEE IT.

43
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,458
- HEY, MIDGET,
WOULD IT HAVE KILLED YOU
TO CAST A SEAL?

44
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:19,833
- Marcosias: ( laughs )
THE HUMANS WOULD FREAK
IF THEY SAW THIS!

45
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:27,500
- MILADY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT MAY BE CAUSING THIS?

46
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,250
- NO CLUE.

47
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,666
IT WAS LIKE THIS
WHEN I GOT HERE.

48
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,000
BUT ONE THING I DO KNOW--

49
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,875
YUJI IS INSIDE OF IT.

50
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,250
( grunts )

51
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,125
- IT'S A SEAL.

52
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,250
THEN WHAT IS THAT BIG,
BLUE SPHERE THING?

53
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,083
( panting )

54
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,375
( heartbeat )

55
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,416
- Margery: WELL,
BRUTE FORCE ISN'T WORKING.
- Wilhelmina: INDEED.

56
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,375
OUR ATTACKS APPEAR
TO BE DOING LITTLE TO NO DAMAGE.

57
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:40,958
- Tiamat: IMPENETRABLE.

58
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,708
- WE'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO KEEP TRYING!

59
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,000
- Alastor: ENOUGH.

60
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,500
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME
BLINDLY ATTACKING IT.

61
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,375
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

62
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,208
- WHOA, MARCO,
DO YOU FEEL THAT?

63
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:59,458
- Marcosias: YEAH,
LIKE THE GROUND UNDERNEATH US

64
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,916
IS PULSATING.

65
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,125
- COME FORTH.

66
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,875
THE FOUNTAIN SHALL FLOW.

67
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,375
- ARE THOSE BEAMS
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE?

68
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,083
WHY WASN'T I
ABLE TO SENSE ANYTHING?

69
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,333
- I DID.

70
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,375
IT WAS RELEASED
A FEW MOMENTS AGO.

71
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,833
IT SEEMS TO BE COMING
FROM UNDERNEATH THE CITY.

72
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,708
- Alastor: THE ONLY DENIZEN
CAPABLE OF PULLING OFF
A STUNT LIKE THIS

73
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,541
IS THE JUDGE OF PARADOXES,
BEL-PEOL.

74
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,083
- BAL MASQUE.

75
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,208
- OF COURSE.
WHAT ARE THEY UP TO NOW?

76
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,750
- THE FIRST STAGE OF OUR PLAN
IS NOW COMPLETE.

77
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,791
- THAT'S MUSIC TO MY EARS.

78
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,875
THIS IS THE FIRST
OF MANY LOFTY GOALS

79
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,333
THAT BAL MASQUE
WILL BRING TO FRUITION.

80
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,833
- MAY POWER GIVE IT LIFE!

81
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,833
- THE MOMENT OF TRUTH!

82
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,291
IT'S ALIVE-- ALIVE!

83
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:11,166
- ( rumbling )

84
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,666
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

85
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,458
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

86
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,416
SOMEBODY MUST BE USING IT.

87
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,375
I CAN FEEL
MY POWER OF EXISTENCE FADING.

88
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,916
WITHOUT THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,
IT WON'T RENEW ITSELF.

89
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,125
AND AS MY POWER RUNS OUT...

90
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,125
I'LL START TO DISAPPEAR.

91
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,416
- STRANGE PRESENCE.

92
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE A DENIZEN.

93
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:56,583
- WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T THINK IT'S FRIENDLY.

94
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,333
- WE WON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH
UNTIL WE GET INSIDE.

95
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,958
I'LL BREAK THROUGH.

96
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,708
I'LL JUST HIT IT
WITH EVERYTHING I'VE GOT!

97
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,166
- Alastor: IT'S USELESS. 
 - I HAVE TO TRY!

98
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,458
- EVEN IF YOU ARE ABLE
TO BREAK THROUGH,

99
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:12,666
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S LURKING
ON THE OTHER SIDE?

100
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,375
IF THIS IS A TRAP
SET BY BAL MASQUE,

101
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,750
YOU MUST KNOW THEY'RE GOING
TO BE EXPECTING US.

102
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,500
- Tiamat: ENEMY AMBUSH.

103
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,958
- Marcosias: IF WE CAN'T
BUST OUR WAY IN,

104
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,041
THEN WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

105
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,583
- WE'LL HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

106
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,333
- SHANA.
- KAZUMI?

107
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,375
DAMN IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

108
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,666
- I-- I'M SORRY,
BUT I'VE GOT NEWS ABOUT SAKAI.

109
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,833
SOMEONE STOLE
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

110
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,458
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, STOLE IT?
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

111
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:47,083
NO.
YUJI'S BEEN KILLED?

112
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,083
- NUH-UH, HE'S STILL ALIVE.

113
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,875
THEY JUST TOOK IT
OUT OF HIM.

114
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,500
- BUT HOW?
THERE'S A KEEPER--

115
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,583
- THE SPELL
THAT CAUSED THE MUTATION
WAS BAL MASQUE'S.

116
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,375
- Marcosias: 
THEY MUST'VE USED IT
TO DISENGAGE THE KEEPER.

117
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,041
IT HAPPENED
RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES.

118
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,625
- KAZUMI, WHERE DID YOU
GET THIS INFORMATION?

119
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,333
- SOMEONE TOLD ME.
- WHO?

120
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,666
- THE ETERNAL LOVER.

121
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,083
- JOHAN?
HE SPOKE TO YOU?

122
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:15,375
- I HEARD HIS VOICE
THROUGH THIS.

123
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,500
- Wilhelmina: 
THE TREASURE TOOL, GIRALDA?

124
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:23,416
- HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK TO ME
WHILE THE KEEPER WAS DISENGAGED,

125
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,666
BUT IT WASN'T FOR VERY LONG.

126
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,375
- I AM AFRAID
I'M GOING TO FADE AWAY

127
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,166
BEFORE I CAN SEE PHELES AGAIN.

128
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,291
BUT NOW,
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD--

129
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,041
IT MUST BE RETURNED
TO THE MYSTES.

130
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,916
- JOHAN.

131
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,458
- GUESS WE'RE LUCKY
SHE SHOWED UP.

132
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,375
- BUT HE CAN'T SURVIVE.

133
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,583
HE NEEDS
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

134
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,208
- Alastor: I DON'T THINK
THERE IS ANY REASON TO WORRY.

135
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,208
EVEN THOUGH
IT WILL NO LONGER RENEW ITSELF,

136
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,375
HE CARRIES ENOUGH POWER
OF EXISTENCE WITHIN HIM

137
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:01,291
THAT IT IS UNLIKELY
HE WILL RUN OUT.

138
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:06,166
- BUT WHAT IF
WE DON'T FIND HIM IN TIME?

139
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,125
- Tiamat: HE'LL DISAPPEAR. 
- ( both gasp )

140
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,333
- Sato: MAN,
THIS LOOKS LIKE BAD NEWS.

141
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,291
- Margery: Keisaku?

142
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,000
- YEAH?
I'M AT THE CRYSTAL ALTAR NOW.

143
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,500
- Good job, kid.

144
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:35,000
I need you to help me out
with something.

145
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,458
CAN YOU SEE WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A BIG, BLUE SPHERE

146
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,791
INSIDE THE SEAL I PUT UP?
- Yeah.

147
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:44,291
- WHAT DOES
THE POWER OF EXISTENCE
ON THE OUTSIDE LOOK LIKE?

148
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,583
- WELL, IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A WHIRLPOOL.

149
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,000
- Okay, I want you
to take a closer look

150
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,583
and see if you can find
a hole or opening on it
anywhere.

151
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,125
- YOU GOT IT.

152
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
- ( Marcosias laughs )

153
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,791
SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S GOT THIS DOWN.

154
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,791
AND TO THINK, WE WERE TRYING
TO TALK HIM OUT OF-- OW!

155
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,708
- A STRUCTURE THIS SIZE

156
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:06,666
HAS GOT TO HAVE
A WEAK SPOT SOMEWHERE.
- INDEED IT MUST.

157
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,875
BUT DON'T YOU THINK BAL MASQUE
WOULD BE AWARE OF IT?

158
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:12,625
- Tiamat: THAT IS A RISK. 
 - Alastor: MMM.

159
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,541
ONE WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE
IF WE WANT TO GET INSIDE.

160
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,500
WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO JUMP IN HEAD FIRST.

161
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,166
- ( Margery laughs )
NOTHING WRONG WITH GAMBLING.

162
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,625
- SHANA.

163
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,875
- WE HAVE TO
GET INSIDE AND FAST.

164
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,291
- WHY?
SO YOU CAN SAVE SAKAI?

165
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:31,250
- NOT QUITE.
SO I CAN FIGHT ALONGSIDE HIM.

166
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,125
HE'S IN THERE
AND HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.

167
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,541
- SHANA.

168
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,333
- CAN'T SEEM TO FIND A WAY OUT

169
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:44,416
AND I CAN'T REACH ANYONE
WITH MY BOOKMARK.

170
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,291
I WONDER WHY SHANA
HASN'T SHOWN UP YET.

171
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,958
IT MUST BE TOUGH
TO GET INSIDE.

172
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:53,166
OTHERWISE I'M SURE
SHE'D BE HERE BY NOW.

173
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,500
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS THING IS,

174
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,500
BUT I CAN SENSE ITS PRESENCE.

175
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,791
AND IT'S RIDICULOUSLY STRONG.

176
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:07,375
IT HAS ENOUGH POWER
TO COMPLETELY LEVEL
MISAKI CITY.

177
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:11,500
IN THAT CASE,
I KNOW WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO.

178
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,291
I HAVE TO GET IT BACK.

179
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,500
I NEED THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

180
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,541
IF I EVER HOPE TO PROTECT
THIS CITY!

181
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,833
- ( wind howling )

182
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,375
- ( steam whistle blows )
- EXCELLENT!

183
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,333
I CANNOT WAIT.

184
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,708
IT WON'T BE LONG
UNTIL OUR EXPERIMENT
BECOMES A REALITY!

185
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,291
- PROFESSOR,
INTRUDER DETECTED!

186
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,708
IT APPEARS TO BE...
- ( beeping )

187
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,250
...THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD'S
FORMER MYSTES.

188
00:16:57,333 --> 00:17:01,250
- SEND THE TROOPS IN AFTER HIM.
HE MUST NOT GET IN OUR WAY!

189
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,583
AS YOU WISH, SIR.

190
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,666
- ( scanning )

191
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,833
- ( heartbeat )

192
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,958
- IT'S UP THERE.

193
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,500
- HA!

194
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:22,666
 OW, OW, OW, OW.
- ( all barking )

195
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,666
( all screaming )

196
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,416
- ( scanning )

197
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,666
- Domino: IT SEEMS THE TROOPS
HAVE LOST TRACK OF THE MYSTES,
PROFESSOR.

198
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,625
- HOW COULD YOU DROP THE BALL
LIKE THIS, DOMINO?

199
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,791
I'VE EQUIPPED YOU
WITH AN ENTIRE ARMY.

200
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,875
I EVEN GAVE YOU
A RADAR ANTENNA.

201
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,333
- TRUE, SIR.
BUT YOU ALSO MADE THE INTERIOR

202
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,291
OF THE CLOCK TOWER SO
COMPLICATED THAT MY TROO--

203
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,000
- AHHH!  YOU MORON!

204
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,291
THAT'S THE LAMEST EXCUSE
I'VE EVER HEARD.

205
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,375
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE
TO NAVIGATE

206
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,958
THE INTRICATE PATHWAYS
I CREATED FOR THEM.

207
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,000
- I WILL REPRIMAND THEM, SIR!

208
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,000
- Sato:
MARGERY, I FOUND SOMETHING.

209
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,333
I SEE WHAT LOOKS
LIKE A SMALL VORTEX
TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE DOME.

210
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,708
YOU GUYS AREN'T GOING
TO GO INSIDE THAT THING,
ARE YOU?

211
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,791
- We've got no choice.

212
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:15,000
Well, that's all I needed
from you.

213
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,708
- 'KAY.

214
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:20,208
- Keisaku,
you've made me proud today.

215
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,375
THANK YOU.

216
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,166
LET'S DO THIS!

217
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:31,208
- THANK YOU FOR TELLING US
WHAT HAPPENED TO YUJI.

218
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,416
- BE CAREFUL.

219
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,791
- DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL BRING HIM BACK WITH ME

220
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,041
AND WE'LL SETTLE OUR RIVALRY.

221
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,666
HOLD ON, YUJI, I'M COMING.

222
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,708
- Kazumi: HOW CAN I COMPETE
WITH THAT?

223
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,583
I'M SO SELFISH.

224
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,791
I SHOULD BE PRAYING
FOR THEIR SAFETY.

225
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,625
- Margery: THERE IT IS.

226
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:05,750
- Wilhelmina: IT'S SMALLER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

227
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,666
- Tiamat: MAKES IT A CHALLENGE.

228
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,541
- LEAVE IT TO ME.

229
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,833
- Marcosias ( laughs ): 
I KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE LONG

230
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,375
BEFORE YOU TOOK THE REINS,
MY DEAR MARGERY DAW!

231
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,375
- I'LL CAST A SPELL

232
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,333
THAT SHOULD
HELP WIDEN THE HOLE A BIT.
JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

233
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,000
- Alastor: IT'S SUCH
AN OBVIOUS POINT OF ENTRY.

234
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:26,041
WE'RE CERTAIN TO BE AMBUSHED
BY THE ENEMY.

235
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,916
- Marcosias: 
LIKE WE DON'T KNOW THAT?

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,375
BUT THE LONGER
WE SIT OUT HERE YAPPIN',

237
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,666
THE LONGER
THE KID'S IN THERE SWEATING!

238
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,458
- HE'S RIGHT.
LOOK, IF ANYONE ATTACKS US,

239
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,875
I'LL HANDLE IT.

240
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,833
- THANK YOU, AND GOOD LUCK.

241
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:42,583
- THE LION AND THE UNICORN--

242
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,333
- Marcosias:
--WERE FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN.

243
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,916
- THE LION BEAT THE UNICORN
ALL AROUND THE TOWN!

244
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,750
AHHH!

245
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,375
- THOUGH YOUR SPEEDY REFLEXES
ARE QUITE IMPRESSIVE,

246
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:20,625
THAT WASN'T ENOUGH TO--
- AHHH!

247
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,583
- THANK YOU, CHANTER.
WE WILL COME BACK FOR YOU.

248
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:29,458
- HA.  NO PROB.

249
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,750
- MARGERY'S DOWN.

250
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,500
- Sydonay: 
SO SHE WAS JUST ACTING
AS A DECOY

251
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,291
TO GET THE TWO OF YOU INSIDE.

252
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,375
HOW NOBLE OF HER, YET STUPID.

253
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,083
DID SHE HONESTLY THINK
YOU COULD STOP US?

254
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,708
- WHAT IS THIS THING?

255
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,750
- Wilhelmina: IT APPEARS
TO BE THE CLOCK TOWER.

256
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,375
IT'S BEEN TRANSFORMED. 
- ISN'T IT STUNNING?

257
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,750
IT'S MY LATEST CREATION.

258
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,541
- Alastor: I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

259
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,041
WHY DO YOU
KEEP ATTACKING THIS CITY?

260
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,666
- I HAVE MY REASONS.

261
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,875
ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN,
FLAME OF HEAVEN.

262
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,750
I AM CONSTANTLY LOOKING
FOR WAYS TO PROVE MY WORTH
AS A SCIENTIST,

263
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,958
SO WHEN I WAS OFFERED
THIS OPPORTUNITY,

264
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,291
I SIMPLY
COULDN'T PASS IT UP.

265
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,000
BEHOLD!

266
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:25,125
AS YOU'LL RECALL,
BALL MASQUE ONCE CREATED

267
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,333
A FOUNTAIN
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE

268
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,333
THAT RAINED DOWN
UPON MISAKI CITY.

269
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,250
- WE DISABLED IT.

270
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,250
- YES, BUT NOT BEFORE
THAT POWER WAS ABSORBED
BY THE EARTH

271
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,125
AND THE LOVELY BEL-PEOL
CAST A SPELL

272
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:42,583
TO HIDE IT
FROM YOU SCOUNDRELS.

273
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:46,791
KNOWING WE HAD
A PLENTIFUL AMOUNT OF POWER
FOR THE EXPERIMENT,

274
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:51,458
WE THEN SENT IN A FAUX VESSEL
TO COLLECT HUMAN EMOTIONS.

275
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,291
- "FAUX VESSEL?"
WHAT IS THIS LUNATIC
RAVING ABOUT?

276
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,041
- FUMINA KONOE.

277
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,375
- YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS
THE BIRTH

278
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,166
OF AN EVOLVED DENIZEN,

279
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,916
ONE THAT IS FUELED
BY POWER OF EXISTENCE

280
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,791
AND UTILIZES HUMAN EMOTIONS!

281
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,041
- ENOUGH WITH THE DRAMATICS,
PROFESSOR.

282
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,500
I THINK THEY GET IT.

283
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:10,416
- DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE,
SYD.

284
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,333
CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT I'M ABOUT TO REVEAL
MY MASTERPIECE?

285
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,333
ITS HEART,
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

286
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:22,291
BEATS WITHIN ITS CHEST.
BEHOLD THE TAIMEI SHIHEN!
- THE TAIMEI SHIHEN?

287
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,791
- Alastor: WE CANNOT
LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS.

288
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:27,541
WE MUST DESTROY THE BEAST
AT ONCE.

289
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:30,291
- PERSONA-- TRANSFORM!

290
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:33,708
I'M READY.
- Tiamat: AS AM I.

291
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,875
- AHHH!

292
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,750
AHHHH!

293
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,458
SUPREME THRONE, HECATE!

294
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:52,875
- ASTER!

295
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,708
- Shana: YUJI,
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE SOMEWHERE.

296
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,916
I CAN FEEL IT.
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,750
TOGETHER, I KNOW
WE CAN PUT AN END TO THIS

298
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,250
BEFORE YOUR POWER RUNS OUT.

299
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,875
- ( Dominos barking )

300
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,458
- SOMETHING KEEPS DRAINING
MY POWER.

301
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:16,416
I CAN SENSE
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,
BUT I CAN'T PINPOINT IT.

302
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,958
I JUST HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
AND KEEP MOVING.

303
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,708
- Domino: GO!

304
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,041
- GO!
- ( grunts )

305
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,083
DAMN IT.
- SECOND STAGE-- COMMENCE!

306
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,916
- ( laughs )
UNLEASH THE POWER!

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,291
- GO!

308
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:52,541
- AHHHHH!

309
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:57,041
- Dantalion:
WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO WITNESS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

310
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,125
IS A MIRACLE OF SCIENCE!

311
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:04,208
ITS VERY EXISTENCE
WAS ONCE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE.

312
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,375
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU

313
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:10,333
THE FIRST CRIMSON DENIZEN
BORN IN THE HUMAN WORLD?!

314
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,458
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,

315
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,541
IT SHALL BE CALLED

316
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:20,125
THE STATUE OF PRIDE!

317
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,958
- THE STATUE OF PRIDE?

318
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,833
- ( theme music playing )


319
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:00,125
- Yuji: 
BAL MASQUE'S SECRET WEAPON
HAS BEEN AWAKENED.

320
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,916
AS I PICK UP MY SWORD,

321
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,958
I CALL OUT THE NAME OF THE
PERSON I WANT TO PROTECT MOST.

322
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:08,333
ON THE FINAL
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND,"

323
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,500
"WHAT MUST BE PROTECTED."
