- Announcer:
DURING THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL,

2
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,916
MISAKI HIGH WAS ATTACKED BY
PHELES, THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY,

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,416
WHO WAS DETERMINED
TO FREE HER ETERNAL LOVER

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,250
FROM THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

5
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,125
YUJI THEN CAST A SEAL,
AND MARGERY WENT BERSERK

6
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,708
UPON SEEING ITS COLOR.

7
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,958
EVERYONE INVOLVED IS
TOUCHED BY SORROW.

8
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,541
AS THEY FIND THEMSELVES
WONDERING WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS.

9
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme music playing )

10
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,208
- THE MIDGET'S LATE.

11
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:50,916
THERE'S ONLY 30 MINUTES
UNTIL YOUR POWER

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,250
OF EXISTENCE
IS REPLENISHED.

13
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,625
WELL, IF SHE DOESN'T
SHOW UP SOON,

14
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,791
I SUPPOSE I'LL JUST
HAVE TO MAKE DO.

15
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,625
- COOL YOUR JETS,
MARGERY DAW.

16
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,375
THE KID'S GOT
PLENTY OF TIME.

17
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,791
THE FLAMING-HAIRED,
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER

18
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:08,000
STILL HAS HALF AN HOUR
BEFORE IT'S MIDNIGHT.

19
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,416
- SHE MUST NOT BE TOO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, HUH?

20
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,666
WHY ELSE WOULD
SHE LEAVE YOU HERE UNATTENDED?

21
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,625
THE CAPRICE OF BEAUTY
AND I COULD TEAR YOU APART.

22
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,916
- ( gasps )
- ( laughs )

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,833
- THAT'S TRUE.

24
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,083
SHE PROMISED SHANA
SHE WOULDN'T TOUCH ME,

25
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,250
BUT BECAUSE OF MY SILVER FLAME,

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,500
I'M STILL HER ENEMY.

27
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,625
AND THEN THERE'S HER.

28
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:39,333
PHELES.  SHE'D RIP ME
TO SHREDS TO FREE JOHAN

29
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,625
FROM THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

30
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,708
- WHAT'S UP?
YOU GETTING COLD FEET?

31
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,250
A LITTLE.
- WELL, I CAN'T REALLY
SAY I BLAME YOU

32
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,791
WITH WHAT YOU'RE
FACING RIGHT NOW.

33
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:54,708
WHAT'S TAKING HER SO LONG?

34
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,750
SHANA.

35
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:24,083
- SAKAI.

36
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,916
- SHARE YUJI'S POWER
OF EXISTENCE?

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,666
- HE WILL HAVE PLENTY TO SPARE

38
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,875
WHEN HIS IS RESTORED
AT MIDNIGHT.

39
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:33,750
SHE DOESN'T NEED MUCH.
JUST ENOUGH TO STAND AND TALK.

40
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,625
- Alastor: HMM.
SHE WON'T BE OF ANY HELP TO US

41
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,375
IN HER PRESENT CONDITION.

42
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,791
IT MUST BE DONE IF YOU WANT
TO QUESTION HER FURTHER.

43
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,250
- BUT, ALASTOR.
SHE'S OUT TO GET YUJI.

44
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,250
- MISTRESS, PLEASE, DON'T WORRY.

45
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,375
I SWEAR.  I WILL PROTECT
THE MYSTES MYSELF.

46
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,583
I SHALL STAY BY HIS SIDE
AND KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON PHELES.

47
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:58,291
PERHAPS IF WE OBSERVE

48
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,041
HOW THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
REACTS TO ITS CREATOR,

49
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:05,583
IT COULD
TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT--

50
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,458
- AH.  YOU THINK IT MIGHT

51
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,750
TELL US SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SILVER.

52
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:16,958
- ARE YOU IN?

53
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:20,125
- OF COURSE I'LL DO IT.
IT'S THE ONLY WAY, RIGHT?

54
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,458
- OKAY.  BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
YOU WON'T TOUCH HIM.

55
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:31,541
OR THE DEAL IS OFF.
- CAN YOU AGREE TO THAT, PHELES?

56
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:34,791
YOU MUST PROMISE NOT
TO DESTROY THE MYSTES

57
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:38,916
IF YOU WISH TO BE REUNITED
WITH JOHAN.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,708
- ( sighs )

59
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:44,375
- I NEED YOU TO AGREE TO THIS
BEFORE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

60
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,625
- I PROMISE.

61
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,125
FOR MY LOVE JOHAN.
- ( sighs )

62
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:54,791
- WE SHALL MEET AT MIDNIGHT,
THE QUESTION IS WHERE.

63
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,166
- HOW ABOUT KEISAKU'S PLACE?

64
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,666
THEN I WON'T HAVE TO DEAL 
WITH CASTING A SEAL.

65
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,041
- WHO ARE YOU?

66
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,250
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

67
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,000
- WELL, I--

68
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,416
- THIS IS NO PLACE
FOR AN ORDINARY HUMAN.

69
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,416
- I'M JUST A REGULAR PERSON.

70
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I DON'T BELONG IN SHANA
AND SAKAI'S WORLD.

71
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,541
DO I?
- ( knock on door )

72
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,083
- WHO'S THERE?
- Shana: ARE YOU COMING?

73
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:35,541
- BUT I THOUGHT I WASN'T--
- JUST GET DRESSED.

74
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,833
HURRY IT UP.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

75
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,875
Shana: NOBODY'S AWAKE.

76
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:51,041
IF THEY WERE,
I'D HAVE SENSED IT.

77
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,000
- ( sighs )

78
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:56,333
YOU CAN SENSE THAT?

79
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,000
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE
SPENT SO MUCH TIME

80
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,333
WITH A HUMAN LIKE SAKAI?

81
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:04,666
- DO YOU WANT TO GO OR NOT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

82
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,333
I WANNA SUPPORT SAKAI.

83
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,916
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR HEART
IS TELLING YOU TO DO, KAZUMI.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
WHO CARES WHAT PHELES SAID?

85
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,458
IT SHOULDN'T MATTER TO YOU.

86
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,041
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- LET'S GO.

87
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:29,666
DON'T LET ANYTHING THE CAPRICE
OF BEAUTY SAYS AFFECT YOU, OKAY?

88
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,625
- THIS IS AMAZING.

89
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,166
THE WORLD OF THE FLAME HAZE.

90
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,291
BUT I WONDER.

91
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,208
WHY IS SHE SHARING THIS
WITH ME?

92
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:50,166
HER EXPRESSION.

93
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,750
I'VE SEEN THAT EXPRESSION
BEFORE.

94
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,625
- I'LL TELL HIM.

95
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:59,708
I WILL.
I'LL TELL YUJI HOW I FEEL.

96
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,791
- I WON'T GIVE UP.
- AND NEITHER WILL I.

97
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:19,791
- WHAT?
- JUST A LITTLE SURPRISED.

98
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
- ALL RIGHTY THEN.

99
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,250
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT
EVERYONE WE NEED PRESENT.

100
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,500
AND WE EVEN HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST.

101
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,458
ARE YOU READY?
WE'D BETTER GET STARTED.

102
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,625
- WHY'D SHANA BRING YOSHIDA?

103
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,541
- CALM DOWN, KIDDO.

104
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,875
I CAST A FEW UNRESTRICTED
SPELLS TO OBSERVE.

105
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,500
- Marcosias: ( laughs )

106
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,666
"A FEW"?  I COUNT FIVE OF 'EM.

107
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,291
YOU SURE ARE BEING THOROUGH.

108
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,416
NICE TO SEE YOU EXERCISE
SOME CAUTION FOR ONCE.

109
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,791
- WATCH IT.
I'M WARNING YOU RIGHT NOW.

110
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,750
IF YOU TOUCH HIS CORE,
I'LL KILL YOU.

111
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,416
- DON'T PANIC.  SHE HASN'T
THREATENED THE MYSTES.

112
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,833
- Tiamat:
JUST AN EMBRACE.

113
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,000
- JOHAN.

114
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,500
I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

115
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,833
YOU'RE SO CLOSE AND YET.

116
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,000
- YUJI!
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

117
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,708
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

118
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,958
I KEPT MY PROMISE.
I DIDN'T TOUCH ITS CORE.

119
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,083
- THE TRANSFER OF POWER
OF EXISTENCE

120
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,958
HAS INDEED BEEN COMPLETED.
IT'S OVER.

121
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,250
- YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?
- I'M FINE.

122
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:17,458
- DID YOU
FIND ANYTHING WORTH MENTION?

123
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,666
- ( laughs )

124
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,666
WELL, IT APPEARS

125
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,708
THAT THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY A SPELL.

126
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,750
- IT MUST BE SABRAC'S SPELL.

127
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,875
- I COULDN'T SAY WHETHER
IT WAS HIS OR NOT.

128
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,000
BUT IT HAS MUTATED THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD'S KEEPER.

129
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,750
- BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HOW COULD IT?

130
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,208
- NOT SURE.  THE ONLY WAY
TO FIND OUT IS

131
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,500
TO INSPECT THE TREASURE TOOL
IN PERSON.

132
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,958
HOWEVER, I WOULDN'T RISK
REMOVING IT

133
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,625
FROM THE MYSTES WITHOUT KNOWING
WHAT DANGER

134
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,583
MAY BE LURKING INSIDE.

135
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:57,041
- IS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE SPELL AND THE SILVER?

136
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,625
- POSSIBLY,

137
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:01,208
BUT I WASN'T ABLE
TO FIND ONE AT THIS TIME.

138
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,000
( sighs )
THE SPELLS I CAST

139
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,416
DIDN'T REALLY GIVE ME
ANY CLEAR ANSWERS.

140
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,791
THEY JUST LEFT ME
WITH MORE QUESTIONS.

141
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,458
- ( Marcosias laughing )

142
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,708
YOU'RE TELLING ME JOHAN,
THE SILVER AND SOME OTHER SPELL

143
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,500
ARE ALL HANGING OUT
IN THERE?

144
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,250
THIS MYSTES, TORCH OR WHATEVER
YOU WANNA CALL IT,

145
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,500
IT'S A PANDORA'S BOX
IF YOU ASK ME.

146
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
- WHO CARES WHETHER
HE'S A TORCH OR A MYSTES?

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,083
- HE'S STILL SAKAI.

148
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,291
- YOSHIDA.
- SHE'S RIGHT.

149
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:33,708
- I'M JUST AN ORDINARY HUMAN.
I MAY NOT MATTER.

150
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,041
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A FLAME HAZE

151
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,166
OR A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

152
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE CRIMSON WORLD,

153
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:45,791
BUT PLEASE DO SOMETHING

154
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,541
FOR ME, PHELES.

155
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,125
- STEP RIGHT UP,
LADIES AND GENTS.

156
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:02,375
ODEN'S ALWAYS BETTER
ON THE SECOND DAY.

157
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,125
- Boy: HEY, IS THAT...

158
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,541
- Boy #2: YEP, THE GRAND PRIZE
WINNER AND RUNNER-UP.

159
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,375
- Girl:
WHO'S THAT WITH THEM?

160
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,333
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

161
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,416
- Wilhelmina: IT IS SAID
THAT YESTERDAY'S ENEMY

162
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
IS TOMORROW'S FRIEND.
HOWEVER, I NEVER IMAGINED

163
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:17,750
THEY WOULD TAKE
THAT PROVERB LITERALLY.

164
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,125
- Tiamat: AGREED.
- I'M SHOCKED.

165
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:23,291
WHO KNEW KAZUMI YOSHIDA
HAD SUCH COURAGE WITHIN HER?

166
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,333
- SURPRISING.

167
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,583
- PLEASE DO SOMETHING
FOR ME, PHELES.

168
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,875
COME TO THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL
WITH ME.

169
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,916
- WAIT, WHAT?
- KAZUMI.

170
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,833
- AW, JEEZ.  THIS HAS GOTTA
BE SOME KIND OF JOKE.

171
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:40,291
YOU DO KNOW WHO SHE IS,
DON'T YOU?

172
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,291
- OF COURSE I DO.
SHE'S A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

173
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,416
BUT SHE'S MORE THAN THAT.

174
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,791
SHE'S A WOMAN WHO'S
IN LOVE WITH A MAN.

175
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,916
WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,416
WE ALL FALL IN LOVE.

177
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,000
HUMANS AND DENIZENS ALIKE.

178
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,416
THE MYSTES YOU WANTED

179
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,625
TO DESTROY.

180
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:04,000
HE'S SPECIAL.

181
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,750
SO PLEASE COME, PHELES.

182
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:10,166
I WANT FOR YOU TO SEE HOW
IMPORTANT SAKAI IS TO ME.

183
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,416
- I'LL GO TO THE FESTIVAL
WITH YOU, TOO.

184
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,750
- SHANA.

185
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,541
- FOR YUJI'S PROTECTION,
OF COURSE.

186
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,416
I'M NOT READY TO LET PHELES
OUT OF MY SIGHT JUST YET.

187
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,666
- YOSHIDA SEEMS
SO MUCH STRONGER NOW.

188
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,416
AND I NOTICED SHANA
CALLED HER "KAZUMI."

189
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,708
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN THEM?

190
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:35,750
HEY, IS THERE A REASON WE HAVE
TO HANG OUT UP HERE ON OUR OWN?

191
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,666
- IT'S BEST WE KEEP
YOU TWO SEPARATED.

192
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,666
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR YOU
TO ATTEND THE FESTIVAL

193
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,333
WHILE PHELES IS THERE.

194
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,333
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR VERY
EXISTENCE IS IN DANGER.

195
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:49,041
YES?
- Tiamat: BLUBBERING IDIOT.

196
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,583
- HERE.
I BROUGHT YOU BOTH A CREPE.

197
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,708
OUR CLASS IS RUNNING A STAND.

198
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,875
TRY IT.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

199
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:04,000
UH... SO IS THIS
YOUR FIRST FESTIVAL?

200
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:08,166
I GUESS I SHOULD EXPLAIN.  IT'S
LIKE A BIG PARTY ORGANIZED BY--

201
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,750
- I KNOW WHAT A FESTIVAL IS,
THANK YOU.

202
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,625
JOHAN WOULD TAKE ME TO THEM.

203
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,833
- I'M BREAKING THROUGH
TO HER.

204
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,333
I'M SURE SHE'LL
LEAVE SAKAI ALONE

205
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,583
ONCE SHE SEES
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM.

206
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,291
- I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING
PHELES IS GOING TO OPEN

207
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,875
HER HEART TO US, BUT MAYBE
KAZUMI IS ON TO SOMETHING.

208
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,333
- SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO NEXT?

209
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,625
- WELL, I'M STUFFED
SO NO MORE FOOD, OKAY?

210
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,541
- LET ME SEE.  THERE'S
THE MARKET OR THE ARCADE.

211
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,666
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
IT'S MY TREAT.

212
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,875
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- HEY, GUYS.

213
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,500
- OH, HEY.
- HAVING A GOOD TIME, MATAKE?

214
00:14:56,583 --> 00:15:00,666
- YEAH. ( laughs )

215
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,166
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
- BIG LUG,

216
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,916
GOT YOUR LADY ALL WORRIED.
PICK THAT CHIN UP, YOUNG MAN.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,791
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

218
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:15,416
- EITA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO RUSH.

219
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,875
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME,
MY FRIEND.

220
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,166
THE MEMORY THAT HAUNTS YOU,

221
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,250
IT WASN'T BASED IN REALITY.

222
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,208
PLEASE,
TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

223
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,500
- YEAH.

224
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,583
- HEY, WAIT.
- MARGERY.

225
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:32,791
WHAT HE WITNESSED,
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD.

226
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,875
I'M SURE IT SCARED HIM
HALF TO DEATH.

227
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,708
I'M HOPING
HE'LL USE THE EXPERIENCE

228
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,375
TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIMSELF

229
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,875
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

230
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,041
- ( laughs )

231
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,083
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU THINK
YOU CAN PLAY PSYCHOLOGIST

232
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,458
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MESSED
THE KID UP IN THE FIRST PLACE.

233
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:55,958
YOU GOT SOME NERVE,
MARGERY-- OW!

234
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,333
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.

235
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,416
- YOU LOOK TROUBLED, INDEED.

236
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,291
- NO, I WAS JUST THINKING.

237
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,541
THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE
FOR ME.

238
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:15,541
EVERYONE ELSE IS OUT HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

239
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:20,333
WHILE MY TIME ON THE OTHER HAND
IS PRACTICALLY FROZEN.

240
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,541
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
IS THE ONLY THING

241
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,541
THAT KEEPS IT TICKING.

242
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,458
TELL ME ABOUT JOHAN.

243
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,583
HE'S INSIDE THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD

244
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,041
AND HE WAS A MYSTES.

245
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,250
JUST LIKE ME.  WAS HE A--

246
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,083
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WAS ONCE HUMAN.

247
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,916
BUT UNLIKE YOU,
HE CHOSE TO BE A MYSTES.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,333
PHELES HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG
YET WHIMSICAL DENIZEN.

249
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,541
SHE ALWAYS INSISTED ON
LIVING IN THE MOMENT. 

250
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,375
SHE RESCUED JOHAN
FROM HIS FATHER,

251
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,166
WHO WANTED TO SACRIFICE HIM
TO GAIN ETERNAL LIFE.

252
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,375
SHE CHOSE TO RAISE THE CHILD

253
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,041
AND AS HE GREW,
THEY GREW CLOSER.

254
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,833
UNTIL ONE DAY.

255
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,416
JUST AS YOSHIDA SAID,
"WE ALL FALL IN LOVE,

256
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,958
HUMANS AND DENIZENS ALIKE."

257
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,541
I'M SURE PHELES
ACCEPTED HER INVITATION

258
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,625
BECAUSE SHE AGREED
WITH THAT SENTIMENT.

259
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,875
- ( sighs ) ALMOST THERE.

260
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,833
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL
IS ALMOST OVER.

261
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,875
AND THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO REST.

262
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,916
- IKE, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

263
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,708
ANOTHER CHILD IS MISSING.
COME QUICKLY.

264
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,250
- ( screams )

265
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,333
- IS THE FESTIVAL ENDING?

266
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,625
JOHAN WILL BE UPSET.
- PHELES.

267
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,541
- SAD, ISN'T IT?

268
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,750
ANOTHER FESTIVAL OVER.

269
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,625
- ALL THINGS COME TO AN END.
PLEASE, DON'T BE UPSET.

270
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,583
TO CHEER YOU UP,

271
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:16,708
I'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING
YOUR HEART DESIRES, JOHAN.

272
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,875
- ANYTHING AT ALL?

273
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:22,583
YOU MEAN IT?

274
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:27,041
- OF COURSE.
- MY HEART DESIRES YOU.

275
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:31,166
TO BE WITH YOU
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY.

276
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,458
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

277
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:47,083
I WOULD GLADLY
GIVE UP MY HUMANITY

278
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:50,625
IF-- IF IT MEANT I COULD BE
WITH YOU FOREVER.

279
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,125
- YOU WOULD?

280
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:56,125
- ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS TRICK TIME.

281
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,333
WE'LL MAKE IT STOP
AT MIDNIGHT.

282
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,041
- NO, JOHAN.  YOU MUSTN'T.

283
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,625
- TELL ME YOU WANT TO SPEND

284
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,000
ALL OF ETERNITY WITH ME.

285
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:17,166
- I DO.
- THEN I SHALL BECOME A MYSTES.

286
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,458
I SHALL STOP TIME
SO I MAY STAY BY YOUR SIDE,

287
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,625
MY BELOVED PHELES.

288
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,958
- JOHAN.
- YOU'RE CRYING.

289
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,791
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- IT'S NOTHING.

290
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:33,666
I WAS JUST REMINISCING.

291
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,500
I ONCE

292
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,333
HAD A LOVE MUCH LIKE YOURS.

293
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,166
YOU MUST TREASURE
YOUR TIME TOGETHER.

294
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,625
- FINALLY SHE UNDERSTANDS.

295
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:52,625
- ( bell rings )
- THIS CONCLUDES THE 72ND ANNUAL

296
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,083
MISAKI HIGH SCHOOL
AUTUMN FESTIVAL.

297
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,583
JOIN US AGAIN NEXT YEAR.
IT'S SURE TO BE A BLAST.

298
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:00,833
- ( cheering )

299
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,625
- THANK YOU, WILHELMINA.
I WAS SO VERY FORTUNATE

300
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:17,208
TO RECONNECT WITH AN OLD FRIEND
LIKE YOU IN THIS PLACE.

301
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,750
THANKS TO YOU,
I'M STILL STANDING

302
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,125
AND I KNOW WHAT JOHAN
IS FACING.

303
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,875
I SIMPLY CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

304
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,125
- PHELES.
- Tiamat: SO JUBILANT.

305
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,125
- I OWE MY GRATITUDE TO YOU,
AS WELL,

306
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

307
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:36,000
IF YOU HAD NOT WARNED ME
ABOUT THE KEEPER'S MUTATION,

308
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,375
I MIGHT HAVE UNLEASHED
SOMETHING TREACHEROUS

309
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,500
FROM WITHIN THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD.

310
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,791
- I ONLY HELPED YOU TO SAVE
MY OWN HIDE, GOT IT?

311
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,791
- ALSO SHANA,

312
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,666
FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

313
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,166
AND, KAZUMI, WHAT YOU
SHARED WITH ME WAS SO SPECIAL.

314
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,541
YOU GAVE ME THE GIFT
OF YOUR TIME.

315
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,958
AND I AM SO VERY GRATEFUL
FOR IT.

316
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:02,000
THANK YOU.
- FOR WHAT?

317
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:05,000
- THANKS TO YOU

318
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:09,333
THE REAL ME IS READY
TO REUNITE WITH JOHAN.

319
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:22,041
- ( gasps )

320
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,250
- NO!
- SAKAI!

321
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,041
- THAT PRESENCE.
- FIGURES.

322
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,250
- NO.

323
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,625
- Shana: PHELES!
- I SEE.

324
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,666
WE HAVEN'T BEEN DEALING WITH THE
REAL PHELES, JUST A PLACEHOLDER.

325
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,416
IT WAS MERELY A FRAGMENT
OF HER CONSCIOUSNESS.

326
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,208
- SO THIS ONE
IS THE REAL THING?

327
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:44,458
- SHE WAS USING
AN UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

328
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,208
THE WHEEL OF WIND.

329
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,750
IT CREATES A DOPPELGANGER
THAT ACTS AS A HOMING DEVICE.

330
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,708
AN ANCHOR TO LEAD
THE CASTER HERE, BUT WHY?

331
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:56,791
- YOU COULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS
ANY MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME.

332
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,000
JUST LOOK AT THIS LINEUP.

333
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:02,750
AN OLD FRIEND,
AN OBSESSED SPELL CASTER,

334
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,875
A HUNTER IN LOVE
AND A FOOLISH LITTLE GIRL.

335
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,750
I MANIPULATED
EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU

336
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,458
TO BE REUNITED WITH MY JOHAN.

337
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,541
- PHELES, NO.

338
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,916
SINCE IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
TO REACH INSIDE OF YOU.

339
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,833
I'LL HAVE HIM COME OUT
ON HIS OWN.

340
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,958
I'M HERE, JOHAN.

341
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,916
- ( screaming )
- YUJI!

342
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,916
- ( slashing )
- ( gasps )

343
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,625
JOHAN.

344
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,708
- ( theme music playing )

345
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,958
- Yuji: A SILVER HAND CLAD IN
ARMOR SUDDENLY REACHES OUT

346
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:34,125
FROM WITHIN THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD, IMPALING PHELES.

347
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:37,416
BEFORE WE CAN EVEN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S HAPPENING,

348
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,291
THINGS TAKE A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.

349
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,791
WE LEARN THAT OUR NEWEST
FRIEND, FUMINA KONOE,

350
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,625
ACTUALLY HAS BEEN
KEEPING A SECRET.

351
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:53,125
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA SECOND"...

352
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,083
"AWAKENING."
