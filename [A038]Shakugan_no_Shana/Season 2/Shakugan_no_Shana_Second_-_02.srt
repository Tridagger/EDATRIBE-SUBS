1
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,250
- Alastor: SHORTLY AFTER THE
SECOND SEMESTER OF SCHOOL BEGAN,

2
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,166
YUJI BEGAN TO FEEL
AN EERIE SENSE OF DEJA VU.

3
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,833
THE REPETITION OF EVENTS
WAS REVEALED TO BE A DREAM

4
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:02,208
CREATED BY
A WEAK CRIMSON DENIZEN.

5
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,416
ONCE YUJI REALIZED
THE TRUTH,

6
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,291
SHANA MADE SHORT WORK
OF HER.

7
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,541
BUT THAT WAS NOT
THE END OF THE STORY.

8
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,166
- ( theme music playing )

9
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:44,458
- ( singing in Japanese )

10
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:47,916
- ( birds chirping )

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,375
- THERE, THAT'LL DO NICELY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

12
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,875
- SORRY TO JUST DROP IN.
THANKS FOR THE HELP.

13
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:55,583
- I'M HAPPY TO HELP YOU LEARN
HOW TO MAKE A BOXED LUNCH,

14
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,708
SO PLEASE DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, DEAR.

15
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,875
THOUGH I MUST CONFESS
I'M CURIOUS--

16
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,916
WHY THE SUDDEN DESIRE
TO COOK?

17
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,583
- HERE, SAKAI.
I MADE THIS BOXED LUNCH FOR YOU.

18
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,000
- DELICIOUS.

19
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,208
YOU'RE A REALLY
FANTASTIC COOK.

20
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,958
- I JUST-- I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
- HUH?

21
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,041
- YUJI REALLY ENJOYED
THAT LUNCH SHE MADE.

22
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,041
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT IT BOTHERED ME

23
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,750
THAT HE LIKED IT SO MUCH.
- I SEE.

24
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,958
NOW WHY DON'T YOU GET
THE EGGS FROM THE FRIDGE?

25
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,583
- OKAY.

26
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,458
- JUST ONE MORE THING...

27
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,041
( chuckles )

28
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,458
- I AM INDEED SORRY TO BOTHER
YOU WITH SOMETHING AS SIMPLE

29
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,166
AS LEARNING HOW TO PREPARE
A BOXED LUNCH, MRS. SAKAI.

30
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,416
- THAT'S ENOUGH FROM YOU!
GET OUT OF HERE ALREADY!

31
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,458
WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE CARE
OF YUJI'S TRAINING?

32
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,083
- BUT SHOULDN'T I BE
THE ONE TO--?

33
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,583
- JUST GO!

34
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,625
- I CERTAINLY DON'T MIND
TEACHING YOU, SHANA.

35
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,458
I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

36
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,125
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
ASKED WILHELMINA FIRST.

37
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,166
I'M SURE SHE'D HAVE BEEN
PLEASED TO LEND A HAND.

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,166
- YEAH, BUT SHE
CAN'T COOK,

39
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,583
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
POINTLESS TO ASK.

40
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,708
- I'LL BET THAT'S NOT
COMPLETELY TRUE.

41
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,916
EVERYBODY HAS A RECIPE OR TWO
UP THEIR SLEEVE.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,625
I'M SURE
SHE DOES TOO.

43
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,291
- SHE CAN ONLY COOK THINGS
THAT GO IN THE MICROWAVE

44
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,375
OR THAT YOU POUR
BOILING WATER INTO

45
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,833
OR RAW STUFF.
BUT I WANT TO KNOW

46
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,208
HOW TO MAKE A MORE
SOPHISTICATED LUNCH THAN THAT.

47
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,833
- MM-HMM.

48
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
- I PUT THE EGGS IN HERE?
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

49
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,333
( sighs )

50
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,708
- ( exclaiming )

51
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,666
CAN'T YOU GIVE ME A BREAK?
- YOU'D BE A BETTER FIGHTER

52
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,250
IF YOU'D DODGE ATTACKS
BEFORE OPENING YOUR MOUTH.

53
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,291
YOU NEED TO FEEL
THE POWER OF EXISTENCE FLOWING.

54
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:01,375
- THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

55
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,458
- ( Wilhelmina's voice )
SHE IS A PURE FLAME HAZE.

56
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,458
WHY DOES SHE FEEL
THE NEED TO WASTE TIME

57
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,791
LEARNING TO PREPARE
A BOXED LUNCH?

58
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,125
ON TOP OF WHICH,
SHE SELECTED

59
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,125
SOMEONE ELSE
AS HER INSTRUCTOR.

60
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,791
- Yuji: I GIVE.
- HER, NOT ME. 

61
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,666
- ( screams )
- SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING,

62
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,750
SURELY YOU'VE NOT FORGOTTEN
THIS IS A TRAINING EXERCISE?

63
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,833
- Tiamat: GO EASIER ON HIM.

64
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,750
- Alastor: ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT, YUJI?

65
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,583
I KNOW
THAT WAS ROUGH.

66
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,583
AS FOR YOU,
SPECIALIST,

67
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:02,916
EVEN IF THIS IS A MYSTES,
YOU WENT TOO FAR.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,916
TAKE CARE
IN THE FUTURE.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,041
- I HAD SOMETHING
ON MY MIND.

70
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,875
WHAT WAS THAT POWER
IN HIM?

71
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,583
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN DISTRACTED
IF YOU'VE ONLY NOW NOTICED

72
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,583
HIS INCREASING STRENGTH
IN BATTLE.

73
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:16,166
YUJI CARRIES FAR MORE
POWER OF EXISTENCE NOW.

74
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,291
IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE HE LEARNS TO CONTROL IT.

75
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,458
- Tiamat: PALACE OF THE STARS.
- INDEED.

76
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,416
- Alastor: BY SYNCHRONIZING
WITH SUPREME THRONE HECATE,

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
IT SEEMS
THIS MYSTES BECAME

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,833
A PART OF THE FOUNTAIN
OF EXISTENCE.

79
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,291
HECATE'S EXISTENCE
IS ETERNAL.

80
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,875
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
SPILLED A GREAT AMOUNT

81
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,833
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE
INTO HER.

82
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,166
HOWEVER, THE BOY SEEMS TO HAVE
REGENERATED THAT LOST POWER.

83
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,166
IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH
HE SUDDENLY HAS

84
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
AN ENDLESS SUPPLY
OF IT.

85
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,958
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY REFILLED

86
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,916
AND ITS POWER AUGMENTED
BY THE FOUNTAIN.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,750
- Tiamat: WHO WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT...

88
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,250
- Wilhelmina: THAT THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD HAD SUCH A POWER.

89
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,625
- Alastor: HMM, NOT I,
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY

90
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,083
I'M HESITANT TO LEAVE
THIS CITY PRECIPITOUSLY.

91
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,208
- Bel-Peol: HOW LOW
HAVE WE FALLEN

92
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,291
THAT THE BAL MASQUE MUST LIVE
IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS?

93
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,000
I KNOW THE PROFESSOR
IS LOOKING FORWARD TO IT,

94
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,125
BUT I'M AFRAID REPAIRING
THE PALACE OF THE STARS

95
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,916
IS GOING TO TAKE
QUITE SOME TIME.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,166
STILL, THERE ARE PLENTY
OF OTHER THINGS

97
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,250
WE CAN TAKE CARE OF UNTIL THEN,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

98
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,083
- INDEED.

99
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,666
I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CUE
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

100
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,958
- IT'LL BE SO LONELY
WITHOUT YOU.

101
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,583
- ( chuckles )
I'M SURE YOU'LL MANAGE.

102
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,666
I CAN TRUST YOU NOT TO DO
ANYTHING IMPOLITE

103
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,958
TO MY HECATE
WHILE I'M GONE?

104
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:46,000
- JUST WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?
- YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

105
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:49,666
LIKE THE BLUE INSIGNIA,
FOR INSTANCE.

106
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,500
- COME NOW,
I THOUGHT

107
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,500
WE WERE ALL WORKING
TOWARD A COMMON GOAL.

108
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,083
I'M SURE HECATE UNDERSTANDS
MY ACTIONS.

109
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,125
- A COMMON GOAL?

110
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,125
YOU COULD
CALL IT THAT.

111
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,541
I JUST DO MY JOB
AND DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

112
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,916
- ( inhales sharply ) MM.

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,916
MY TRAINING WAS
WAY TOUGH TODAY.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,250
I MEANT TO ASK YOU,
HOW COME I'M TRAINING

115
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,250
WITH WILHELMINA
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

116
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,916
- BECAUSE YOU CAN DEVELOP
BAD HABITS

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,500
TRAINING WITH THE SAME PERSON
ALL THE TIME, THAT'S WHY.

118
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,250
- Alastor: ALSO,
THERE'S THE FACT

119
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,666
THAT YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE
HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY.

120
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,416
- OH, YEAH,
THAT TOO.

121
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,708
YOU'RE ABOUT AS POWERFUL
AS A CRIMSON LORD THESE DAYS.

122
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:37,083
- I CAN'T SAY
I'VE NOTICED A CHANGE.

123
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:40,583
FOR SOME REASON IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO GET A FEEL FOR IT MYSELF.

124
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,958
- Alastor: THAT'S WHY WE MUST
CONTINUE YOUR TRAINING.

125
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,791
YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO CONTROL THE
POWER THAT IS NOW INSIDE YOU.

126
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,041
THANKFULLY,
YOU'VE ALREADY MASTERED

127
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,041
THE ART OF CASTING
A SEAL.

128
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,291
- YEAH.
- I GUESS SO.

129
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,708
- YOU'RE BECOMING
STRONGER, YUJI.

130
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,000
- IKE, YOU WANT TO GO
GRAB SOME LUNCH?

131
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:11,625
- WELL, I WOULD,
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY GOT LUNCH.

132
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,083
- HUH?
- HERE YOU GO, SAKAI.

133
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:18,583
I DECIDED TO MAKE A CLUB
SANDWICH FOR YOU TODAY.

134
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,416
- WOW, SOUNDS GREAT.

135
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,833
I BET THERE'S NOT A SINGLE
RECIPE YOU CAN'T MAKE.

136
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,916
- NO, THERE'S PROBABLY LOTS.
- I BROUGHT MY LUNCH TODAY,

137
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,916
SO WHY DON'T ALL OF US
EAT TOGETHER?

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,166
- Kazumi: I'LL GO GRAB US
SOME DRINKS.

139
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,500
- DUDE, DON'T MAKE HER
FEEL BAD.

140
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,333
- OH, YEAH.

141
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,458
- WELL, HERE WE GO.

142
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,875
- THANK YOU.
LOOKS GREAT.

143
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,208
- YUJI!

144
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,541
HERE.
- WHAT'S THIS?

145
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,916
- IT'S FOR YOU.
- YOU MADE IT?

146
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,375
THANKS, SHANA.
THAT WAS SWEET.

147
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,166
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING
THIS MORNING-- MAKING ME LUNCH?

148
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,666
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I'VE GOT MORE THAN I CAN EAT,

149
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,791
SO I THOUGHT I'D SHARE.
MAYBE I'LL DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

150
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,750
- WELL, THANK YOU.
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

151
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,333
- ( Yuji's voice ) THIS FOOD IS
GOOD, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH OF IT.

152
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:36,041
AND I'M NOT EVEN
ALL THAT HUNGRY THIS AFTERNOON.

153
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:42,625
CAN'T EAT MORE OF ONE
THAN THE OTHER.

154
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,583
( moaning )

155
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,208
( Yugi's voice )
IT HURTS.

156
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,833
- ( thud )

157
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,833
- SOMETHING WRONG?
SAKAI?

158
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,708
- YUJI!
- ARE YOU OKAY?

159
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,666
- ( bells jingling )

160
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,708
- Shana: YUJI.
- IT WAS SWEET OF HIM

161
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,375
TO EAT EVERYTHING WE MADE,
BUT I THINK IT WAS TOO MUCH.

162
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,041
I HOPE
HE'LL BE OKAY.

163
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,041
- HERE'S A THOUGHT:
HOW ABOUT YOU STOP

164
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,541
BRINGING HIM LUNCHES EVERY DAY
SO HE DOESN'T END UP LIKE THIS?

165
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,750
DON'T YOU GET IT?
YUJI AND I

166
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,958
COULD BE FACED WITH A SERIOUS
FIGHT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

167
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,250
AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY HELP
IN THIS CONDITION.

168
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,958
- SORRY.
I UNDERSTAND.

169
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,791
I WON'T MAKE AS MUCH
ANYMORE.

170
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,791
- THE LUNCH I MAKE HIM
WILL BE FINE.

171
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,791
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION.

172
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,500
YUJI IS NOT A REGULAR
MYSTES ANYMORE,

173
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,166
SO STOP INTERFERING!

174
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:59,333
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.
I CARE AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

175
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,500
SEE, I MAY NOT
FULLY GET

176
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,500
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM
LIKE YOU,

177
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,500
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT I LOVE HIM.

178
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:09,750
AND I AM GONNA KEEP SHOWING HIM
THAT LOVE BY MAKING HIM LUNCHES.

179
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:12,291
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.
- WANNA BET?

180
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,958
- THERE'S MORE TO HIS LIFE
THAN FIGHTING ALONGSIDE YOU.

181
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,375
- I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND.

182
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:21,750
IT'S NOT HER FAULT.
AFTER ALL, YOSHIDA'S ONLY HUMAN.

183
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,958
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE COULD COMPREHEND.

184
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,958
- ( bells jingle )

185
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,833
- IT'S A SEAL!
YUJI, WAKE UP!  YUJI!

186
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,916
- SHANA, LET HIM BE.
HE NEEDS HIS REST.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,250
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

188
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,500
COME ON, GET UP.
THERE'S A DENIZEN HERE.

189
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,166
- WE NEED TO MOVE OUT.
- YEAH, OKAY.

190
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,041
- NO, WAIT.
SAKAI, I WANTED TO SAY--

191
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,708
NEVER MIND.
PLEASE BE SAFE OUT THERE.

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,291
- Yugi: THE MISAGO FESTIVAL.

193
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,541
- WE'RE IN THE SEAL,
BUT I DON'T FEEL A PRESENCE.

194
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,666
- WAIT.

195
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,041
SHANA, THIS IS THE BONFIRE
FROM THE FESTIVAL.

196
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,791
- THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS FOR US

197
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,208
TO FOCUS ON
RIGHT NOW.

198
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,875
- BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE.
IT'S SEPTEMBER.

199
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,125
THE MISAGO FESTIVAL
IS HELD IN AUGUST.

200
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,875
- WHICH MEANS...

201
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,000
HA!

202
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,666
IS IT JUST ME OR HAS SOMETHING
SIMILAR TO THIS HAPPENED BEFORE?

203
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,208
- ( bells jingle )

204
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:42,291
- Shana: WAKE UP!
DID YOU HEAR ME?

205
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,583
- WAIT A SEC.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

206
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,125
THE PAST
IS REPEATING AGAIN.

207
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,875
- ( bells jingle )

208
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,041
- Mare: A TRANSIENT,
AND YET ETERNAL AFFAIR.

209
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,916
- HOW COULD I FORGET
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

210
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,083
WAIT, SHANA.
IT'S A DREAM!

211
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,250
WE'RE INSIDE A DREAM AGAIN!
- WHAT?

212
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,500
- DON'T YOU SEE?
- SEE WHAT?  WHAT'S GOING ON?

213
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,125
- IT'S LIKE YESTERDAY.

214
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,125
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

215
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,375
THAT DENIZEN MADE ME FALL INTO A
DREAM IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE.

216
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:27,875
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT UNTIL
NOW, BUT IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN.

217
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,458
THE PAST IS REPEATING ITSELF
ENDLESSLY.

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,916
- WHAT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

219
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,583
- WAIT.

220
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,541
- ( grunts )

221
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,833
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING, HUH?

222
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:42,166
- ( chuckles ) GOOD.

223
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,833
I WAS JUST MAKING SURE
YOU'RE REAL.

224
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,666
- OKAY, YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS
ALL HAPPENING INSIDE OF A DREAM?

225
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,916
I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
THAT CRIMSON DENIZEN

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,625
TO HAVE SUCH A SKILL.
- YEAH, I THOUGHT WE BEAT HER,

227
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,625
BUT I GUESS
I WAS WRONG.

228
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,250
- SHE'S STILL...
- ALIVE.

229
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,166
- IT IS WEIRD THOUGH.
LAST TIME I WOKE UP

230
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,000
WHEN I REALIZED
I WAS HAVING A DREAM.

231
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,333
AND NOW WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT IT IS,

232
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,416
SO WHY CAN'T WE WAKE UP?
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

233
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,916
- I GUESS WE'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO ASK HER.

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,833
- ( bells jingle )

235
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,958
- WHAT NOW?

236
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,708
- SOMETHING'S DEFINITELY UP.
IF THIS IS REALLY A DREAM,

237
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,833
THEN ONLY THINGS
WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST

238
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,375
CAN HAPPEN
WHILE WE'RE HERE.

239
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
AM I RIGHT?
- YEAH, SO?

240
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,416
- WELL, WE SAW THE SEAL
BACK IN THE NURSE'S OFFICE.

241
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,916
SO THAT MEANS WE WERE ALREADY
IN A DREAM EVEN AT THAT POINT.

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,666
THEREFORE, YOSHIDA SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING

243
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,875
THAT YOU AND I
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW ABOUT.

244
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,833
BUT SHE DID.

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,291
- NO, WAIT.

246
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,625
SAKAI, I WANTED TO SAY--

247
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,250
NEVER MIND.
PLEASE BE SAFE OUT THERE.

248
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,833
- I DON'T REMEMBER
HER SAYING THAT BEFORE.

249
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,208
DO YOU?

250
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:53,666
OKAY, THEN THAT TOTALLY
VALIDATES MY THEORY.

251
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,708
YOU SEE?
- YEAH, I DO.

252
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,541
THIS IS YOSHIDA'S DREAM TOO,
ISN'T IT?

253
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,666
- AND IF SHE REALIZES THAT,
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE.

254
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,958
- YOSHIDA!

255
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,750
- ( chuckles )

256
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:19,875
- THAT JOKER'S THE DENIZEN
WHO'S BEHIND THIS DREAM?

257
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,083
- I DON'T KNOW.  IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THE GIRL FROM YESTERDAY.

258
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,500
- HOW RUDE OF ME.

259
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,750
I HAVEN'T FORMALLY
INTRODUCED MYSELF.

260
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,791
MY NAME IS MARE,
THE KEEPER OF JESTFUL SLUMBER.

261
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,791
AND YOU'VE
FOUND ME OUT:

262
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:36,416
YOU'RE INSIDE GEMEINDE, MY MOST
POWERFUL UNRESTRICTED SPELL.

263
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
THIS WORLD WAS CREATED
USING YOUR MEMORIES.

264
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,541
- SO WHEN WE FOUGHT YOU
YESTERDAY,

265
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,416
WHAT WE KILLED WASN'T ACTUALLY
PART OF THE CORE OF YOUR BEING.

266
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,083
- NO, YOU ONLY KILLED
A MYSTES.

267
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,583
- ( bells jingle )
- A RATHER USEFUL ONE

268
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,166
THAT HAD THIS TREASURE TOOL
CALLED PAPAGENA.

269
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,125
I WAS SIMPLY INHABITING
ITS BODY.

270
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,166
- YOU'RE AWFULLY SMALL
FOR A CRIMSON DENIZEN.

271
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,250
NO WONDER I COULDN'T SENSE
YOUR PRESENCE.

272
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,458
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH US?

273
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,458
- I'M STILL
FIGURING THAT OUT MYSELF.

274
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,041
( laughs )

275
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,041
- DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME, LITTLE GIRL?

276
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,083
- YUJI, WHILE I'M
DEALING WITH HER,

277
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,875
I NEED YOU TO TRY AND FIND
A WAY TO WAKE UP YOSHIDA.

278
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,333
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ESCAPE.

279
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,583
- I'LL DO MY BEST.
- ( Mare laughing )

280
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:35,708
INSIDE GEMEINDE,
EVERYTHING GOES AS I WANT IT TO.

281
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,583
TOO BAD FOR YOU.

282
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,083
YOUR FRIEND IS NEVER
GOING TO WAKE UP.

283
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,583
AND NEITHER WILL
THE TWO OF YOU.

284
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,416
- ( laughs )

285
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,791
I TRIED TO WARN YOU.

286
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,750
EVERYTHING GOES MY WAY
IN THIS WORLD.

287
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:19,083
- SHANA!
- ANOTHER THING YOU SHOULD KNOW:

288
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,583
YOU CAN DIE
IN YOUR DREAMS.

289
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:24,500
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
GO AND WAKE UP YOSHIDA.

290
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,708
- NOT WISE--
TURNING YOUR BACK ON ME.

291
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,458
- ( Yuji's voice ) DREAM OR NOT,
THIS IS CRAZY.

292
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,166
HOW IS THAT THING NOT HURT
BY SHANA'S ATTACKS?

293
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,416
IT'S LIKE
IT'S NOT EVEN REAL.

294
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,041
- ( Shana's voice ) SO WHEN
WE FOUGHT YOU YESTERDAY,

295
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,833
WHAT WE KILLED WASN'T ACTUALLY
PART OF THE CORE OF YOUR BEING.

296
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,625
- IS IT POSSIBLE
THIS ISN'T THE CORE EITHER?

297
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,833
SO MAYBE...

298
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,541
- SEEMS YOU'RE NOT AS STUPID
AS YOU LOOK.

299
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,291
- SHANA,
SHE'S INSIDE OF ME!

300
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,333
MARE IS INSIDE
MY BODY!

301
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:09,708
- WHILE YOU TWO ARE BUSY
GIVING YOURSELVES HEART ATTACKS,

302
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,750
I'M GETTING EVEN CLOSER
TO THE TREASURE I SEEK.

303
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,166
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE BEST PART?

304
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,208
YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME.
- NO.

305
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,500
- Mare: BECAUSE I'M
INSIDE THIS MYSTES.

306
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:21,250
- YUJI!

307
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,125
- NO WAY.

308
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,750
- ( Mare screams )

309
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,166
- THIS POWER--
IS IT A KEEPER?

310
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,125
- A KEEPER?

311
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,541
- IT'S A TREASURE TOOL

312
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,541
THAT BAL MASQUE
HAS BEEN AFTER.

313
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,666
IF I WERE
TO OBTAIN IT,

314
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,791
EVERYBODY WOULD
KNOW MY NAME

315
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,083
AND THEY WOULD
SEEK ME OUT.

316
00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,750
ALL THAT'S LEFT
FOR ME

317
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,708
IS TO KILL THE MYSTES
WHO POSSESSES IT.

318
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,541
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- IF I DIE,

319
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,000
THE DREAM WORLD I'VE CREATED
WILL COLLAPSE AROUND YOU.

320
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,041
WITHOUT THE GIRL,
YOU WILL NEVER WAKE.

321
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,416
YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO ESCAPE THE DREAM.

322
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
SO IN THE END,
I STILL WIN.

323
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,541
- Shana: DAMN IT.

324
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,541
- WAKE UP, YOSHIDA.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

325
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,250
WAKE UP NOW.

326
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,000
YOSHIDA!

327
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,875
- ( mumbles )

328
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,250
SAKAI, IT'S YOU.

329
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,250
- HEY, WELCOME BACK.
- I HAD A DREAM.

330
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,333
- SHE'S AWAKENED?
IMPOSSIBLE.

331
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,291
( screams )

332
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,500
- ( clock chiming )

333
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,291
- WHAT HAPPENED?

334
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,291
- THANK YOU.
YOU WERE GREAT.

335
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,083
WE'RE ALL STILL HERE
BECAUSE OF YOU, YOSHIDA.

336
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,083
YOU KNEW
IT WAS A DREAM.

337
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,750
I'M AMAZED.

338
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,166
- AMAZED?
DON'T BE.

339
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,625
SOMEHOW I KNEW YOU'D BE THERE
TO PULL ME OUT OF THE DARK.

340
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:17,875
WHATEVER I DID, IT WAS ONLY
SO I COULD SEE YOU AGAIN.

341
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,833
- YOU SAVED US.

342
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:23,541
- OH, NO.  SAKAI,
ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?

343
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,458
HE MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

344
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,000
- ( Shana's voice )
CAN'T LET HER GET TO ME.

345
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,666
WE'LL HAVE A MAJOR PROBLEM
IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN,

346
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,833
SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PACK
IN HIS LUNCH, OKAY?

347
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,541
UNLESS YOU WANT HIM
TO GET SICK.

348
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,916
- WOULD IT HELP IF I CUT
THE PORTION IN HALF?

349
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,250
- Alastor: A KEEPER?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

350
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,916
- MM-HMM, WHEN THE DENIZEN
GOT INSIDE OF YUJI,

351
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,708
SHE NOTICED IT RIGHT AWAY.
IT SEEMS A STRONG KEEPER

352
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:01,791
HAS BEEN PUT
ON THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

353
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,833
- Alastor: I NEVER
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT.

354
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:06,500
- A KEEPER.
INTERESTING.

355
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,375
- Sato: COME ON, MARGERY,
DON'T YOU THINK

356
00:22:10,458 --> 00:22:12,458
YOU'RE OVERDOING IT A BIT?
- FOR REAL.

357
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,833
WE CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL WHEN
YOU'RE HUNG OVER LIKE THIS.

358
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,541
- WHAT?  WAIT.

359
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:18,875
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU BOYS
WERE INTO GOING TO SCHOOL.

360
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,666
- WELL, NOT REALLY.

361
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,708
- Marcosias: LISTEN TO THE KIDS.
THEY'VE GOT A POINT.

362
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:24,750
YOU'RE DRINKING
IS OUT OF LINE.

363
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:27,708
SHOW SOME SELF-CONTROL,
MY BELOVED MARGERY DAW.

364
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,416
- CAN'T HELP IT.

365
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,416
I NEED SOMETHING
TO CALM MY NERVES.

366
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,083
- ( ice clinks )

367
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,416
- Man: I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
OUR NEW TRANSFER STUDENT.

368
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,833
THIS IS FUMINA KONOE.

369
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,458
IT MAY TAKE HER A WHILE
TO GET USED TO THINGS HERE,

370
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,875
SO I WANT YOU ALL
TO HELP HER OUT AS BEST YOU CAN.

371
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,875
- IMPOSSIBLE.
- SHE MAY NEED SOMEONE...

372
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,708
- IS THIS ANOTHER DREAM?
- ...GET HER CAUGHT UP

373
00:22:50,791 --> 00:22:52,250
ON OUR SCHOOLWORK
SO FAR.

374
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,958
- ( end theme playing )

375
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:14,875
- ( singing in Japanese )

376
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:28,500
- ( Yugi's voice )
OUT OF NOWHERE,

377
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,250
A GIRL WHO LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
THE SUPREME THRONE HECATE

378
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,458
HAS TRANSFERRED
INTO OUR CLASS.

379
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:36,000
HOW CAN WE BE SURE
SHE'S REALLY HUMAN?

380
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,458
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

381
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:40,750
SHANA'S SUSPICIONS GROW,

382
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:43,458
UNTIL SHE FINALLY
POINTS HER SWORD AT KONOE

383
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,416
WHILE THE NEW GIRL
IS FROZEN IN A SEAL.

384
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,083
NEXT TIME
ON "SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II,"

385
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,458
"THE SUSPICIOUS
TRANSFER STUDENT."
