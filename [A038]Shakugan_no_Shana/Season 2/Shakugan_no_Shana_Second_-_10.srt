1
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,583
- Alastor: MARGERY RECOUNTED
THE STORY OF HER MEETING

2
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:55,791
WITH AN IDEALISTIC YOUNG FLAME
HAZE NAMED YURI.

3
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,666
DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES,
THE BOY SAVED HER LIFE

4
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,833
AFTER SHE WAS WOUNDED
IN BATTLE.

5
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,875
AS SUCH, TANAKA AND SATO
ARE SHOCKED TO HEAR HOW READILY

6
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:08,541
MARGERY SACRIFICED YURI'S LIFE
IN ORDER TO SAVE HER OWN.

7
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,708
- ( theme music playing )

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,541
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

9
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,208
- ( gasps )

10
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,875
- WHAT?
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

11
00:02:56,958 --> 00:03:00,250
- YUJI.  YOUR FLAME'S COLOR.

12
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,250
- YEAH?

13
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,625
IT'S SILVER.

14
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,000
- Lamies:
DON'T CHASE THE SILVER.

15
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:11,791
- Marcosias: WHAT?
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?

16
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,625
- Lamies: IT'S POINTLESS.
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH HIM.

17
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,083
YOU CAN SEARCH,
BUT YOU'LL NEVER FIND HIM.

18
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,541
HE SIMPLY APPEARS.
- I CAN'T GIVE UP.

19
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:22,041
I NEED MY REVENGE.

20
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,083
DO YOU THINK I CAN
JUST LET IT GO?

21
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,500
I CAN'T.  KILLING HIM IS
ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME.

22
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,958
- THAT GUY MARGERY
WAS HUNTING.

23
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,208
- SHE'S STILL SEARCHING.
- HIS FLAME.

24
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,000
WAS IT SILVER LIKE THIS?
- Alastor: YES, IT WAS.

25
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,958
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES IS STILL
HAUNTED BY THE SIGHT OF IT.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,916
- IS IT A COMMON COLOR?

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
- NO, ONLY THE SILVER POSSESSES
A FLAME LIKE THIS.

28
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS?

29
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,250
- I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW.

30
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,416
- Lamies: AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED, THIS HAS NO BEARING

31
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,250
ON WHO YOU ARE, YUJI SAKAI.

32
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,375
WE'LL ASK THE SPECIALIST
OF EVERYTHING ABOUT IT

33
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:05,583
WHEN SHE RETURNS.

34
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,625
- RIGHT.

35
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:13,250
LISTEN, PLEASE TRY NOT TO USE
YOUR POWER OF EXISTENCE.

36
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,708
WE'LL HAVE TO PUT YOUR TRAINING
ON HOLD FOR NOW.

37
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:19,666
- AGREED. THIS MUST
BE KEPT SECRET FROM
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES.

38
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,333
- YEAH, OKAY.

39
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,041
A TORCH.  A MYSTES.

40
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,291
AND NOW THE SILVER.

41
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:48,208
- Chigusa: HURRY UP, YUJI.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

42
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:51,166
- YEAH, OKAY.  LATER.

43
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,000
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

44
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,833
- GOOD MORNING.
- MORNING.

45
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:08,125
I'M SORRY IF I'M LATE.

46
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,750
- NAH.
I GOT HERE KIND OF EARLY.

47
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,208
- IS SHE ON HER WAY?

48
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:15,250
- NO, KONOE'S NOT FEELING
TOO HOT.

49
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,166
HER BUTLER TOLD ME
SHE'LL STILL BE AT SCHOOL.

50
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,166
BUT HE'S GONNA DRIVE HER
BACK AND FORTH UNTIL
SHE'S FEELING BETTER.

51
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,916
- I HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

52
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,333
- Ike: LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY.

53
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:59,458
I GOT OUR ASSIGNMENTS
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

54
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,000
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING
AT THE FESTIVAL.

55
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,666
I DON'T THINK IT
SHOULD BE TOO HARD.

56
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,708
OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.
WE'VE STILL GOT SOME RESEARCH

57
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:09,083
TO DO AND CONCESSIONS
TO TAKE CARE OF.

58
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,291
FORTUNATELY,
IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE THEME,

59
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,625
SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
GET A GOOD AMOUNT DONE
WITHIN THE WEEK.

60
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,375
WE'LL HAVE TO ASK
THE UPPERCLASSMEN FOR TIPS

61
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,500
ON HOW TO RUN THE CREPE STAND.

62
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:21,125
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS WE
NEED TO DECIDE, THOUGH.

63
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,166
- ( all gasp )

64
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,166
- HEY, SHE MADE IT.

65
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,250
- I DO APOLOGIZE
FOR OUR TARDINESS.

66
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:13,000
AS ALWAYS, I TRUST SHE'S
IN GOOD HANDS WITH YOU.

67
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,708
- FEELING BETTER?
WE HEARD YOU'VE BEEN SICK.

68
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,458
- OH, I'M FINE NOW.

69
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,958
I'M SORRY IF MY BUTLER HAD
YOU ALL WORRIED ABOUT ME.

70
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,250
- SO GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.
AND YOU MADE IT JUST IN TIME

71
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:28,416
TO HEAR ALL ABOUT
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL.

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
- THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL?
- I GUESS IT'S NEW TO YOU, HUH?

73
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,250
- WELL, IKE.
YOU GONNA EXPLAIN IT TO HER?

74
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:38,166
- IT IS PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

75
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,083
- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
- WHAT?

76
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,750
- OH, UH, NOTHING.

77
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:47,166
( clears throat )
OKAY, I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN.

78
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,458
THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL IS
AN ANNUAL CELEBRATION.

79
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:51,791
THERE ARE FOOD STANDS
AND DIFFERENT EXHIBITS.

80
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,208
OTHER SCHOOLS DO IT TOO,
BUT OURS IS UNIQUE

81
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,000
BECAUSE WE HOLD
AN OPENING PARADE.

82
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:59,000
REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH CLASS
DRESS UP IN COSTUME AND MARCH

83
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,791
FROM THE SHOPPING DISTRICT
TO THE TRAIN STATION AND BACK.

84
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,916
AND AFTER THE PARADE,
EVERYONE VOTES ON
THEIR FAVORITE COSTUMES.

85
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,625
- YEAH, THAT'S THE BEST PART
OF THE FESTIVAL.

86
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,333
ONE BOY AND ONE GIRL ARE CHOSEN
FOR THE GRAND PRIZE.

87
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,958
IT'S A PRESTIGIOUS AWARD
EVERYONE WANTS TO WIN.

88
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,541
- SURE, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

89
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,458
- NOT REALLY YOUR THING, HUH?
- HUH?

90
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,250
- KONOE, YOU WERE ONE OF
THE PEOPLE CHOSEN TO REPRESENT

91
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,416
OUR CLASS IN THE PARADE.

92
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,875
- WHO ME?
- YEP.

93
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,541
YOU AND THE OTHERS LISTED
ON THE BOARD.

94
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,125
- UH...

95
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,000
- SORRY, I'M THE ONE
WHO NOMINATED YOU KONOE.

96
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,958
I FIGURED YOU'D BE PERFECT,
'CAUSE YOU'D LOOK GOOD
IN ANY COSTUME.

97
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,750
- WILL YOU BE WEARING
A COSTUME, TOO?

98
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,333
- GUESS SO.
SINCE EVERYBODY VOTED FOR ME.

99
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,208
- STUPID VOTE.
I DEMAND A RECOUNT.

100
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,166
- DON'T BE SUCH A SPOILSPORT.
IT'LL BE FUN.

101
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,208
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO IT
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

102
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,125
- NO, I'LL DO IT.

103
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,416
- RIGHT ON.
THAT'S WHAT I WANNA HEAR.

104
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,166
- OKAY, NOW THAT
WE'VE CHOSEN OUR CAST.

105
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,583
WE JUST GOTTA DRAW
OUR ROLES, RIGHT?

106
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,708
YEAH.

107
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:05,625
SO THE THEMES CHOSEN FOR
OUR CLASS THIS YEAR ARE
"THE WIZARD OF OZ"

108
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,041
AND "ROMEO AND JULIET."

109
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,000
THE GUYS HAVE ALREADY
DRAWN THEIR ROLES.

110
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,375
TANAKA'S THE LION.
SATO'S THE TIN MAN.

111
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,916
I'M THE SCARECROW
AND SAKAI IS ROMEO.

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,666
- AND I JUST DREW TOTO SO IT
LOOKS LIKE I'LL BE JOINING

113
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,291
"THE WIZARD OF OZ" GROUP.
- THAT LEAVES THREE ROLES.

114
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:24,666
DOROTHY, THE WICKED WITCH
AND JULIET ARE STILL
UP FOR GRABS.

115
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,375
HERE, DRAW ONE.
- Ike: WONDERFUL.

116
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:30,250
WHY DOES YOSHIDA HAVE TO
BE ONE OF THE GIRLS UP

117
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
FOR THE PART OF SAKAI'S JULIET?

118
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,833
- I WONDER WHO'S GONNA BE
YOUR SWEETHEART.

119
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,083
- IT'S JUST FOR THE PARADE,
DUDE.

120
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:39,416
- IF I DRAW THE ROLE OF JULIET,

121
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,708
I'LL GET TO WALK IN THE PARADE
WITH SAKAI.

122
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,500
- ALL I WANT IS TO PLAY THE PART
OPPOSITE YUJI.

123
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,125
- ( gasping )

124
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:49,833
- GO AHEAD.

125
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,916
- HEY, CONGRATULATIONS.
- CONGRATULATIONS FOR WHAT?

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,416
- YOU GET TO PLAY SAKAI'S LOVE
INTEREST, YOU LUCKY DUCK.

127
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,541
YOU BEAT OUT BOTH
SHANA AND KONOE.

128
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,541
- IT'S NO SECRET, KAZUMI.

129
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,083
WE ALL KNOW YOU THREE ARE
VYING FOR HIS ATTENTION.

130
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:21,458
- YOU'RE BEING SILLY.
SERIOUSLY.  IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

131
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:24,375
- YOU'RE NOT HAPPY?
- IT'S JUST THAT, WELL,

132
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:28,333
I-- OF COURSE I'M HAPPY.
- ( laughing )

133
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,458
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN
I WOULD'VE BEEN THRILLED,

134
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,416
BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE ANYMORE.

135
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,916
NOW I KNOW THAT PLAYING
A ROLE ISN'T ENOUGH.

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,750
AND I'M SURE SHANA
FEELS THE SAME.

137
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,833
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY
DISAPPOINTED,

138
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,333
BUT CHEER UP,
YOU'LL BE A PERFECT DOROTHY.

139
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,083
- YEAH, I'LL COME UP
WITH A GREAT COSTUME DESIGN.

140
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:49,000
- WEIRD.  KNOWING KAZUMI
WILL BE YUJI'S JULIET

141
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,041
DOESN'T BOTHER ME
LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

142
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,958
GUESS WE'VE FINALLY MOVED
BEYOND OUR PETTY JEALOUSY.

143
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,208
- I WANT SAKAI AND ME

144
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,708
TO BE SOMETHING MORE.

145
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,708
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN
WITH THIS, RIGHT?

146
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,166
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

147
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,000
DEEP DOWN I'M HAPPY, BUT--

148
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:17,750
- OH, HEY.
THINK KONOE'LL BE OKAY?

149
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,666
THE REST OF US GREW UP WATCHING
THE PARADE EVERY YEAR.

150
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,750
BUT SHE'S DRESSING UP
ON HER FIRST ONE.

151
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,291
MAYBE IF I SWITCHED OUT
OF MY ROLE AS ROMEO.

152
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,125
- YUJI, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

153
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,375
THE PART OF ROMEO
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

154
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,041
- OKAY.
- THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU

155
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,583
TO SWITCH ROLES.

156
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,583
YOU'LL PLAY ROMEO
TO KAZUMI'S JULIET

157
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:42,500
AND THAT'S THAT, RIGHT?
- RIGHT, OF COURSE.  SORRY.

158
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,541
- THANKS, SHANA.

159
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,291
- ( telephone rings )
- ( grunting )

160
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,583
HOLD ON.  I'M COMING.

161
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:55,625
HELLO, SAKAI RESIDENCE.

162
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:58,000
YUJI, WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

163
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,041
- Ike: WE CAN ONLY WORK
AFTER SCHOOL UNTIL 6:00.

164
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,541
IF YOU NEED TO STAY LATER
THAN THAT FOR SOME REASON,
LET ME KNOW.

165
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,875
WE'LL BE ABLE TO STAY OVERNIGHT
ONCE WE GET CLOSER

166
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,458
- TO THE FESTIVAL.
- Class: OKAY!

167
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,750
- REALLY?  YOUR MOM'S
GONNA DONATE MATERIALS

168
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,291
FOR OUR PARADE COSTUMES?
HOW SWEET OF HER.

169
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,375
- SHE TOLD ME SHE PROBABLY
HAS MOST OF THE FABRIC
WE'RE GONNA NEED.

170
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,625
WE COULD PICK IT UP TODAY,
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.

171
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,291
I'M STUCK DOING STUFF UP HERE
ALL DAY.

172
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,125
- I'LL GO.
IT'D BE NICE TO GET OUT.

173
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,708
- YOU CAN'T CARRY IT ALL.

174
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:08,666
- MAYBE SHANA COULD COME
WITH ME?

175
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,625
- SURE.

176
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,083
- I KNOW.

177
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,958
I FEEL THE SAME.

178
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,916
- YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT
OF THE DOGHOUSE WITH SHANA.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,791
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

180
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,541
MY MOM OFFERED 'CAUSE SHE
DOESN'T SEW AS MUCH

181
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,416
AS SHE USED TO.
WHAT?

182
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,125
- NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL.

183
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,416
- Chigusa: GOODNESS.
YUJI'S PLAYING ROMEO?

184
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,166
NOT EXACTLY A PERFECT FIT.

185
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,291
- OH, I THINK HE'LL BE--

186
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,041
- I MEAN, WHY NOT?

187
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,666
- I DON'T KNOW.

188
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,166
ROMEO IS A PASSIONATE YOUNG MAN
SO IN LOVE WITH JULIET

189
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,958
THAT HE'S WILLING TO FOLLOW HER
ANYWHERE, EVEN INTO THE COLD,

190
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,500
DARK ARMS OF DEATH ITSELF.
THAT'S NOT MY YUJI.

191
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,291
- BUT ROMEO WAS SO DENSE
HE COULDN'T TELL JULIET

192
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,791
WAS REALLY DEAD.
YUJI'LL DO FINE.

193
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:07,041
- ( laughing )
- DON'T BE CYNICAL.

194
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,958
WHEN JULIET WAKES
TO FIND ROMEO DEAD,

195
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,083
SHE TAKES HER OWN LIFE.
THEIR LOVE WAS SO PURE.

196
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:13,500
THEY WANTED
TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

197
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,416
- OH.
- Chigusa: SHE'S RIGHT.

198
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,791
THAT'S A PART OF WHAT LOVE IS.

199
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,500
THE DESIRE TO BE CLOSE
TO A PERSON, NO MATTER WHAT.

200
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,875
ISN'T THAT HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT YUJI?

201
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,625
YOU JUST WANT
TO BE CLOSE TO HIM?

202
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,791
- I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO PUT IT INTO WORDS BEFORE,

203
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:32,666
BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT IS HOW I FEEL.

204
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,166
- IT'S EMBARRASSING,

205
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,833
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT
I FEEL THAT WAY, TOO.

206
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,500
- IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

207
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,125
YOU CAN SEE THE PERSON YOU WANT
IN FRONT OF YOU,

208
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:42,875
BUT YOU CAN'T REACH HIM.

209
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,500
- IT'S LIKE
THERE'S AN INVISIBLE WALL.

210
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,375
ALL YOU WANNA DO
IS KNOCK IT DOWN,

211
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:51,125
BUT YOU CAN'T SEEM
TO MAKE IT BUDGE.

212
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,250
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

213
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,250
- THAT WAS A GOOD ANALOGY,
SHANA.

214
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166
JUST KNOW THAT IF YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF TRYING

215
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,666
TO BREAK THROUGH THAT WALL,
IT'S OKAY TO MOVE ON.

216
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,041
THAT JUST MEANS
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

217
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,375
BUT IF YOU CHOOSE
TO KEEP FIGHTING

218
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:09,000
BECAUSE YOU TRULY WANT
TO BE CLOSE TO HIM.

219
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,375
IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL,
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.

220
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,333
IT'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

221
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,875
YOU WANT TO STAY FOR DINNER?
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME.

222
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:24,166
- Kazumi: WE SHOULD GO.
THANKS FOR THE INVITE, THOUGH.

223
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,333
- YES, THANK YOU.

224
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:30,041
- YOUR HEART WILL TELL
YOU WHAT TO DO.

225
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,291
WE'LL SEE.

226
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,541
- LISTEN, WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LOOK BACK.

227
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:41,125
WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED.
IT'S NOT A DENIZEN.

228
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:44,625
BUT SOMEBODY'S BEEN TAILING US
EVER SINCE WE LEFT YUJI'S HOUSE.

229
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,833
I'M PRETTY SURE
WE CAN SHAKE HIM,

230
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,708
BUT YOU HAVE TO DO
EXACTLY AS I SAY.

231
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,583
- OKAY.

232
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,916
- HE ALMOST CAUGHT UP WITH US.
HE'S GOT SKILLS.

233
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,458
- WHO DO YOU THINK HE IS?
- WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

234
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,083
WE'RE GONNA TURN
THE TABLES ON HIM.

235
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:30,416
STRANGE.  HE SEEMS TO BE
HEADING BACK TOWARD YUJI'S.

236
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,166
IT MIGHT BE CHIGUSA HE'S AFTER.
LET'S TAKE A SHORTCUT.

237
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,500
- THAT DIDN'T TAKE AS LONG
AS I THOUGHT.

238
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,166
- ( gasps )
- ( shouts )

239
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,250
HE DODGED.

240
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,666
IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

241
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,291
- SHEESH.  YOU GOT ME GOOD.

242
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,583
WOW!  YOU SURE ARE STRONG,
LITTLE LADY.

243
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,458
- WHO THE--?
- WHAT THE HECK?

244
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:06,333
DAD, YOU'RE BACK?
- HE'S YOUR DAD?

245
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,791
- YEP, THAT'S ME.
KANTAROU SAKAI.

246
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,125
NICE TO MEET YOU.

247
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,750
- Chigusa:
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN?

248
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,083
YOUR LITTLE PRANKS JUST
AREN'T FUNNY, DEAR.

249
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,250
I WORRY THEY'LL END UP GETTING
YOU IN TROUBLE ONE DAY.

250
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,208
- FOR REAL, DAD.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

251
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:26,083
WHY YOU CAN'T JUST COME HOME
LIKE A NORMAL PERSON?

252
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,458
INSTEAD, YOU'RE FOLLOWING
MY FRIENDS

253
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:29,791
LIKE SOME
KIND OF CREEPY STALKER.

254
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,000
- YEAH, SORRY,
I'M AWAY SO MUCH.

255
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,958
CAN YOU BLAME ME
FOR BEING CURIOUS?

256
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,208
I JUST WANT TO SEE WHAT
MY ONLY SON'S BEEN UP TO

257
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:37,875
WHILE I'VE BEEN GONE
ON BUSINESS.

258
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:41,083
AND ANYHOW--

259
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,958
IT'S FUN.
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

260
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,791
- PLEASE TRY
TO CONTROL YOURSELF, HON.

261
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,083
YOU SHOULDN'T BE FOLLOWING
PEOPLE.  YOU COULD SCARE THEM.

262
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,666
- I KNOW.  I KNOW.

263
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,500
BUT IT WAS STARTING
TO GET DARK OUT.

264
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,041
I WAS SIMPLY MAKING SURE THAT
THE GIRLS WHO ARE NICE ENOUGH

265
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,750
TO LOOK AFTER MY BOY
MADE IT HOME SAFELY.

266
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,666
THOUGH, I CAN SEE NOW, THEY
DIDN'T REALLY NEED MY HELP.

267
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,333
( laughs )

268
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,000
- YOU ASKED FOR IT.

269
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,708
LET ME MAKE IT UP
TO YOU LADIES

270
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,208
WITH A NICE HOME-COOKED MEAL.

271
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,500
- OKAY.

272
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,458
- THANKS FOR THE FOOD.

273
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,833
- IT MAY SEEM STRANGE,
BUT IT'S TRADITION FOR US

274
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,375
TO SERVE OUR MEALS FAMILY-STYLE.

275
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:18,958
WELL, KANTAROU'S TRADITION.

276
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,791
- THIS WAY EVERYBODY
GETS A TASTE

277
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,958
OF EACH OF THE DIFFERENT DISHES.
IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME.

278
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,791
- YOU GUYS BETTER HURRY.  FOOD
DISAPPEARS QUICKLY AROUND HERE.

279
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,458
- YES, PLEASE HELP YOURSELVES.

280
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,458
- IT'S DELICIOUS.

281
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,666
CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I'VE MISSED YOUR COOKING.

282
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,583
- OH, IT'S JUST LEFTOVERS.
- OH, YEAH?

283
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,916
WELL, IT'S SO GOOD
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,250
- EXCUSE ME.
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE.

285
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,041
YOU TWO LOOK TOO YOUNG
TO HAVE A TEENAGER.

286
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,291
- YOU THINK SO?
- THANK YOU.

287
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:51,708
- MY DAD KNOCKED MY MOM UP
WHEN THEY WERE STILL STUDENTS.

288
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:54,750
- WOW, THEY WERE THAT YOUNG?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

289
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,125
THEY WERE JUST KIDS WHEN
THEY DECIDED TO GET HITCHED.

290
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,083
- MARRIED AS STUDENTS.
ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC?

291
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,375
- IT MAY SOUND ROMANTIC,
BUT MARRIAGE IS A BIG STEP

292
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:07,291
TO TAKE WHEN NEITHER OF YOU
HAS FINISHED GROWING UP.

293
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,750
I KNOW YOU'RE CURIOUS,
BUT PLEASE DON'T ASK US

294
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:13,166
HOW OLD WE ARE.  CHIGUSA WOULD
THROW AN ABSOLUTE FIT.

295
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,791
- HUSH.  YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT TROUBLE TONIGHT.

296
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,791
- ( laughing )

297
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:23,250
- YUJI, WOULD YOU MIND CLEARING
THE TABLE FOR ME?

298
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,041
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME COFFEE.

299
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,625
- SURE.

300
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,375
SHANA AND YOSHIDA WENT OUTSIDE
WITH DAD.

301
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,875
I WONDER WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

302
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,750
- DON'T WORRY.

303
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,541
- I HOPE HE DOESN'T
EMBARRASS ME.

304
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,125
- GOTTA SAY,

305
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,791
THAT'S TRULY A GEM
OF WISDOM SHE GAVE YOU.

306
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,500
"LISTEN TO YOUR HEART AND IT
WILL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO."

307
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,541
THAT'S MY CHIGUSA FOR YOU.

308
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,083
- I'M SORRY.
I HATE TO PRY.

309
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,666
BUT WATCHING THE TWO
OF YOU INTERACT,

310
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,833
IT'S OBVIOUS YOU HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP.

311
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:02,041
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT
HAVE ADVICE FOR US.

312
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,375
- I DON'T KNOW, GIRLS.
I'M NOT WISE ENOUGH

313
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,750
TO BE HANDING OUT ADVICE
TO OTHERS.

314
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:10,875
BUT I'M FLATTERED
YOU ASKED ME.  THANKS.

315
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,875
- THAT DOESN'T HELP US.
- HMM?

316
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,583
- YOSHIDA WASN'T TRYING
TO FLATTER YOU.

317
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,333
WE NEED TO KNOW.

318
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,666
- IS THAT SO?
WELL, THEN LET ME THINK.

319
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,833
CHIGUSA AND I WERE
SO YOUNG WHEN WE MET.

320
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,791
WE LOST OUR WAY A FEW TIMES,
BUT WE NEVER GAVE UP.

321
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:40,291
SOMEHOW, WE ALWAYS MANAGED TO
FIND OUR WAY BACK TO EACH OTHER.

322
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:43,750
'CAUSE LIKE SHE TOLD
YOU EARLIER, WE LISTENED
TO OUR HEARTS

323
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,083
AND THEY TOLD US WHAT TO DO.

324
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,375
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY OUR MARRIAGE
HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL?

325
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,708
JUST BETWEEN US?
- MM-HMM.

326
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,708
- IT'S BECAUSE SHE HELD ON.

327
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,333
LIKE THIS!
- ( gasping )

328
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:02,666
- ( laughs )
LIKE MOST MEN IN MY FAMILY,

329
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,291
I WANTED TO FLY FREE AS A KITE
AND NEVER BE TIED DOWN,

330
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:09,541
BUT SHE GRABBED MY KITE STRING
AND HELD ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

331
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,583
AND AS LONG AS SHE KEEPS
HOLDING,

332
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,791
I'LL NEVER BE LOST.

333
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,083
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO OUT THERE?

334
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,083
YOU'RE NOT FILLING
THEIR HEADS WITH MORE

335
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,500
OF YOUR SILLY STORIES,
NOW ARE YOU?
- OF COURSE NOT.

336
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,375
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STORY.

337
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
- IF YOU SAY SO.

338
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:33,708
WELL, COFFEE'S READY
WHENEVER YOU WANT IT.

339
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,458
- WELL, SHALL WE?

340
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,416
IF YOU FIND
YOU'RE FEELING LOST,

341
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,333
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS
REACH OUT.  YOU NEVER KNOW.

342
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,291
THERE MIGHT BE SOMEONE
REACHING OUT TO YOU AS WELL.

343
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,166
COME ON, GIRLS.
IT'S COFFEE TIME.

344
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,166
CHIGUSA'S IS THE BEST
YOU'LL EVER TASTE.

345
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,125
- IF YOU FIND YOU'RE
FEELING LOST...

346
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,000
- YOU HAVE TO REACH OUT.

347
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,708
- I KNEW IT.  I HAD A FEELING
PHELES WAS STILL ALIVE.

348
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,833
- YES, SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

349
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:29,791
BUT SHE'S NOT HERE.
SHE'S OUT SEARCHING.

350
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:33,125
- FOR WHAT?
- THE TREASURE TOOL.

351
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,750
COME NOW.
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT OF PHELES?

352
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,416
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD IS
A MEMENTO OF HER LOST LOVER.

353
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,708
SHE'S GOING TO FIND
THAT MYSTES.

354
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,250
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

355
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:48,625
- BUT IF THAT
SHOULD COME TO PASS...

356
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,750
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

357
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:29,166
- Yuji: THE AUTUMN FESTIVAL
IS QUICKLY APPROACHING.

358
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,750
TO FINISH PREPARATIONS,
OUR CLASS IS ALLOWED

359
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,375
TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT SCHOOL.

360
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:35,916
SHANA JOINS IN ON THE FUN
LIKE ANY OTHER STUDENT.

361
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,583
THAT IS, UNTIL WILHELMINA
RETURNS WITH NEWS.

362
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,958
SHE TELLS US THE TALE OF PHELES
AND HER "ETERNAL LOVER" JOHAN,

363
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:44,416
THE CREATORS OF
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

364
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,833
DANGER LOOMS ON THE HORIZON.

365
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,708
NEXT TIME ON
"SHAKUGAN NO SHANA II"...

366
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,666
"THE PROMISED PAIR."
