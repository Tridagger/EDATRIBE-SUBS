1
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,791
Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,458
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,833
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:45,916
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,083
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,333
Yuji: THERE ARE MANY
TYPES OF ENCOUNTERS.

9
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,458
SOME OF THEM CAN LEAD TO
CONFRONTATION OR EVEN BATTLE.

10
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,625
- THOSE THREE ARE DENIZENS!

11
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,375
- SHOULD WE REALLY
BE LETTIN' EM GO?

12
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,500
- Marco: WE DIDN'T LET THEM GO.

13
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,166
THEY LET US GO.

14
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,375
- Margery: SHUT UP,
STUPID MARCO.

15
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,500
( phone ringing )

16
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,125
- Yuji: WHILE OTHER
ENCOUNTERS MIGHT CONSIST

17
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:44,208
OF A SIMPLE CONVERSATION

18
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,458
BETWEEN A LORD FROM ANOTHER
REALM AND A HOUSEWIFE.

19
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,250
- BESIDES, GIRLS CAN BE
QUITE PRECOCIOUS.

20
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,250
THEY'RE MORE MATURE
THAN THEY APPEAR.

21
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,750
- Alastor: MADAME.

22
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,291
- Yuji: AND WHAT ABOUT
SHANA AND I?

23
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,666
WHERE'S THAT GOING?

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,416
I HAD THE FEELING I WOULDN'T
KNOW THE ANSWER

25
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
TO THAT ANY TIME SOON.

26
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:10,291
- HUH?
- HUH.

27
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,458
- WHOA.
- I'LL NEVER DO IT WITH YOU.

28
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,333
- Ike: DON'T LOOK SO WORRIED.

29
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:50,416
HIRAI AND SAKAI ARE
JUST GOOD FRIENDS,

30
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,333
THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH EACH OTHER.

31
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,666
- Yoshida: HMM, I CAN'T HELP IT!

32
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,541
I AM WORRIED.
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.

33
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,333
AND I THINK MAYBE YUKARI
CARES FOR HIM TOO.

34
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:09,083
BUT THEN, WHO DOES SAKAI LIKE?

35
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,291
( groans )

36
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,708
I'VE GOTTA STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

37
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,666
( cat meows )

38
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,708
HUH?

39
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:31,791
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY, BUT LET'S
GO FOR A WALK, EKATERINA.

40
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,125
( panting )

41
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,541
- Yuji: SHANA!

42
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,791
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
GO A LITTLE SLOWER?

43
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,916
WE JUST FINISHED TRAINING.
THIS IS A BIT MUCH.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,708
- SHUT UP AND RUN!

45
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,750
- ( sighs ) I ONLY CAME BECAUSE
YOU SAID YOU HAD SOMETHING

46
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,291
TO SHOW ME.

47
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,833
OH WELL, IT BETTER BE WORTH IT!

48
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:13,583
NOW THAT'S...
A VIEW.

49
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,083
- I LOVE THE WAY IT
LOOKS AT NIGHT.

50
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,541
- ( meows )

51
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,541
- DON'T RUN OFF LIKE THAT!

52
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,583
- ( sighs )

53
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,291
- HOW COULD SAKAI BE
SO CASUAL ABOUT THIS?

54
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,375
I DON'T GET IT. DOESN'T HE KNOW
HOW YOSHIDA FEELS ABOUT HIM?

55
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:52,791
I MEAN, SHE'S LOYAL, SHE'S
ATTENTIVE, SHE'S ADMIRABLE.

56
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:56,458
SO WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE ABOUT HER?
SHE'S JUST GREAT!

57
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,583
- ( gasps )

58
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,541
- Ike: MORNING!

59
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,500
- OH, GOOD MORNING IKE.
YOU'RE EARLY TODAY.

60
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,250
- YOU OKAY?

61
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,000
- I, I WOKE UP REALLY
EARLY THIS MORNING.

62
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,125
I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP.

63
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:23,083
I WALKED MY DOG DOWN TO THE
RIVERBANK. AND THEN I...

64
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,541
AND THEN I...

65
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,833
- Sorath: ( laughing )
WHAT A FEAST!

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,291
- YOU SURE YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD ON TO THE ORGEL?

67
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:50,750
- YES. I'M UNEASY LETTING
MY BROTHER TAKE CARE OF IT.

68
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,125
WE HAVE TO FIND THE OWNER
OF THE NIETONO NO SHANA

69
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,958
AND MAKE THEM
HAND IT OVER TO US.

70
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,625
- Sydonay: SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING YESTERDAY,

71
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,041
BUT I DON'T THINK
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES

72
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,250
IS GOING TO LEAVE US
ALONE FOR MUCH LONGER.

73
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:05,250
EVEN YOU TWO WOULD HAVE
TROUBLE TAKING ON

74
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,375
TWO FLAME HAZES
AT THE SAME TIME.

75
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,583
- I'M NOT WORRIED,

76
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,958
AND I'M THE ONE MAKING
THE DECISIONS,

77
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,916
SO JUST FOLLOW
INSTRUCTIONS.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,208
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT FLAME HAZES

79
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,541
DON'T LIKE TO TEAM UP.

80
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,541
IF ANY OTHER
INSIGNIFICANTS ATTACK,

81
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:24,916
THEN I'LL FINISH THEM OFF AS
WELL. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,416
- HMM, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

83
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,333
BUT TAKING HER LIGHTLY
COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.

84
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,916
- OH DON'T WORRY.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,333
AS LONG AS WE STAY INSIDE THIS
CRADLE GARDEN, WE'RE INVINCIBLE.

86
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,083
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TAKE CARE OF THE ORGEL.

87
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,666
THAT'S NOT TOO HARD
TO UNDERSTAND, IS IT?

88
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,791
- Tanaka: PLEASE BIG SISTER,
TELL US WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

89
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:46,166
- HUH?

90
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,166
- IT'S NOT TRUE THAT
THE DENIZENS LET US GO, IS IT?

91
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,333
THE TRUTH IS YOU
COULDN'T FIGHT THEM,

92
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,625
BECAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT OUR SAFETY, RIGHT?

93
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,208
IT BURNS ME UP THAT
YOU WERE HUMILIATED LIKE THAT,

94
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,708
BECAUSE WE WERE
HOLDING YOU BACK.

95
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,125
PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING!
BIG SISTER!

96
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,625
- HAVING LUNCH ON THE ROOF
IS KIND OF A NICE CHANGE.

97
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,958
- Yuji: I GUESS.

98
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,458
- I WANNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING

99
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,083
THAT HAPPENED EARLY
THIS MORNING.

100
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,375
I HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING,

101
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,291
SO I WENT FOR A STROLL DOWN
BY THE MANA RIVER.

102
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,541
I SAW YOU DOWN BY THE RIVERBANK.

103
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,666
- OH?

104
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,208
- IKE.

105
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,333
- YOU SAID NOTHING'S GOING ON.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

106
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,500
YOU ACCEPT YOSHIDA'S AFFECTIONS,
BUT THEN YOU GO AND DO THAT?

107
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,875
- Yuji: WELL, THAT'S...

108
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,125
- Ike: DO YOU THINK
THAT'S RIGHT?

109
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,208
- HMM?

110
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,333
- I SAID, "DO YOU
THINK THAT'S RIGHT?"

111
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,083
IF YOU KEEP PLAYING
GAMES LIKE THIS,

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,750
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
HURTING SOMEONE.

113
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,916
- Yoshida: STOP IT!

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,375
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO DO THIS, IKE.

115
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,375
- I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS.
- BUT YOSHIDA.

116
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:56,333
- I'M NOT LIKE THAT. I'M NOT!

117
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,041
- ( door slams )

118
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,333
- Ike: ACTUALLY, YOSHIDA
WAS THE ONE

119
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:19,666
WHO SAW YOU TWO
THIS MORNING, NOT ME.

120
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,958
- Yuji: I SEE.

121
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,458
- Ike: SHE TOLD ME
ABOUT IT BEFORE CLASS.

122
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,625
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I REACTED THAT WAY,

123
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,500
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU EATING
THE LUNCH SHE'D MADE FOR YOU,

124
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:30,500
I JUST COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

125
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,291
I GUESS I STUCK MY NOSE IN
WHERE I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

126
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,000
I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BY IT.

127
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,583
- I GUESS YOU SCREW UP
EVERY NOW AND THEN, TOO.

128
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,541
- SCREW UP?

129
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:43,291
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

130
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,500
- IT'S COOL.

131
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,875
I'M EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT IT,

132
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,833
BUT THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF TRUTH
TO WHAT YOU SAID.

133
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,208
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD'VE
JUST KEPT IT BETWEEN US.

134
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,583
- YEAH.

135
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,166
- Yuji: HEY, CAN I ASK
YOU A QUESTION?

136
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,916
- SURE.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,041
- DO YOU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOSHIDA?

138
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,541
- ( Yoshida crying )

139
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,625
- I'M SO STUPID.
I'M JUST SUCH AN IDIOT.

140
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,416
IKE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
BUT I PANICKED,

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,125
JUST BECAUSE HE HAD THE COURAGE
TO SAY THE THINGS I COULDN'T.

142
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,291
I'M SO AFRAID TO SAY ANYTHING.

143
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,625
I THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK OUT
IF I LEFT THINGS ALONE.

144
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,750
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
HANGING AROUND EACH OTHER,

145
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,875
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

146
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,958
AND THEY LOOK SO
NATURAL TOGETHER.

147
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,166
I THOUGHT IF I TRIED
TO COME BETWEEN THEM,

148
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,375
WHATEVER CONNECTION
I HAD WITH SAKAI,

149
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:04,875
HOWEVER SMALL IT MIGHT BE,

150
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,625
WOULD BE BROKEN.
AND I'D BE LEFT ALONE.

151
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,833
- WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY?

152
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,833
- RUN AWAY?

153
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,791
YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR, YUKARI!

154
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,166
- FAIR ABOUT WHAT?

155
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,291
- YOU MUST HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM
TOO. ADMIT IT, YOU LIKE HIM!

156
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,666
- ( gasps )

157
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,000
- ME? HAVE FEELINGS FOR YUJI?

158
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,541
- Yoshida:
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO COLD,

159
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,333
AND YOU ACT LIKE YOU DON'T CARE.

160
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:42,625
BUT YOU'RE SO MUCH
CLOSER TO HIM THAN I AM.

161
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:45,541
- IT'S NOT FAIR!
- Shana: IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

162
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,041
- YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY TOO.
RUNNING FROM THE TRUTH.

163
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,708
- I'M WHAT?
WHY SHOULD I STAND HERE

164
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,333
AND TAKE THIS
KIND OF TALK FROM YOU?

165
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:54,000
- I HAVE THE RIGHT
TO SAY IT.

166
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,458
'CAUSE I LOVE HIM TOO.

167
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,916
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID?
I LOVE SAKAI!

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,250
- YUJI. YUJI IS MY...
HE'S MY...

169
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,416
WHAT IS HE?

170
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,291
- MAYBE YOU'RE
RIGHT, YUKARI.

171
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,833
MAYBE I WAS RUNNING AWAY,
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

172
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,958
I'VE DECIDED I'M
NOT GONNA RELY ON OTHERS

173
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,125
AND LEAVE THINGS UNSAID.
I CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS,

174
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,750
AND I'M GONNA DO
THE BEST I CAN, MY WAY.

175
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,125
YUKARI HAVE YOU EVER TOLD SAKAI
THAT YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM?

176
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,708
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
I TELL HIM MY FEELINGS.

177
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,208
- YOU CAN'T
- AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM MYSELF.

178
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,291
- NO, DON'T!

179
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,416
- AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM
THAT I LOVE HIM.

180
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,166
- NO, YOU CAN'T!
YOU CAN NEVER TELL HIM THAT!

181
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,291
- I WILL! I'LL TELL HIM!

182
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,375
WE'LL LET SAKAI CHOOSE.

183
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,708
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE. YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN TOLD HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

184
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,958
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
I ALSO HAVE FEELINGS.

185
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,708
I ALSO HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM!

186
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:06,833
- HUH? I THINK THIS IS A...
IT'S A SEAL.

187
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:15,625
- WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
WHO ARE YOU TO STAND IN MY WAY?

188
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,625
WHEN I'M DONE, I'M GONNA COME
BACK AND TELL YOU HOW I FEEL.

189
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,375
YOU DON'T STAND
A CHANCE WITH HIM.

190
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,000
YUJI AND I HAVE A LOT
GOING ON BETWEEN US.

191
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,875
YOU ARE CRAZY IF YOU THINK
THAT I'M GONNA LOSE TO YOU.

192
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:28,583
( echoing ) I WILL NOT
LOSE TO YOU!

193
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,958
- Sorath: HEY TIRIEL!
I CAN SENSE IT.

194
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,666
THE NIETONO NO SHANA
IS OVER THERE!

195
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,583
- Tiriel: VERY WELL THEN.
LET US RETRIEVE IT TOGETHER,

196
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,166
WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY,
DEAR BROTHER.

197
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,375
- ( explosion )

198
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,083
- ENGULFED IN LOVE,
THE SIBLINGS FROM YESTERDAY.

199
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,375
THEY'RE COOKING UP
SOMETHING BIG OUT THERE.

200
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,458
- Marco: WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, MARGERY DAW,

201
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,250
MY BEAUTIFUL GOBLET?

202
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,958
LET THEM LET US ESCAPE AGAIN?

203
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:06,375
- YEAH, AFTER ALL,
THEY'RE NOT AFTER ME.

204
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,333
THERE'S NO REASON TO GO THROUGH
THE TROUBLE OF A CONFRONTATION.

205
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,500
- WHY NOT? WHY DON'T
YOU WANNA GO?

206
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,333
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO BE THIS TIMID.

207
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,833
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
NOT TO GET IN YOUR WAY.

208
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,833
PLEASE, BIG SISTER, FIGHT THEM!

209
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,333
- Sato: NEVER MIND.

210
00:14:21,416 --> 00:14:23,875
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO,
THEN I'LL HEAD OVER THERE.

211
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,708
I'D RATHER DO THAT THAN BE SEEN
AS SOMEONE WHO HOLDS YOU BACK.

212
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,041
- Margery: LISTEN YOU TWO...

213
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,833
- Tanaka: I'M GOING WITH HIM,
BIG SISTER.

214
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,208
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT WHEN
I HAVE TO, I CAN FIGHT TOO.

215
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,750
- Margery: ALRIGHT,
ALRIGHT ALREADY.

216
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,208
WE'LL START BY HEADING OVER
TO THE DEPARTMENT STORE.

217
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,583
THAT PRESENT THE DOLL FREAK LEFT
FOR US MIGHT COME IN HANDY.

218
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,625
- LET'S DO IT!

219
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:47,583
- Yuji: IS THIS A SEAL?
- Shana: LOOKS LIKE IT,

220
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:50,458
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT'S SO BIG.

221
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,500
- COULD IT BE A TRAP
OF SOME SORT?

222
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:57,166
- I SENSE THREE DENZIENS.
TWO OF THEM ARE COMING THIS WAY.

223
00:14:58,291 --> 00:15:00,208
- Alastor: AND ONE IS
STAYING PUT.

224
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,000
- THREE AGAINST ONE,
NOT THE BEST ODDS.

225
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:07,333
- HEY SHANA, MARGERY, HOW 'BOUT
IF WE ASK HER TO HELP OUT?

226
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:09,583
- REMEMBER WHEN WE
SAW HER BY THE POOL?

227
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,583
THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES
WON'T BE OF ANY USE TO US NOW.

228
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,833
- Alastor: OUR FIRST PRIORITY
IS TO DEAL WITH THE ONES

229
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,250
COMING AFTER US.

230
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,833
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

231
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:21,166
- YUJI, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GO AND HIDE SOMEWHERE.

232
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,750
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
I'M GOING WITH YOU!

233
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,666
- THIS BATTLE COULD
BE DANGEROUS.

234
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,125
- I'M READY.

235
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,458
- IF THESE DENIZENS ATTACK
YOU WITH SOMETHING YOUR

236
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,166
FIRE REPELLING
RING CAN'T HANDLE,

237
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,083
YOU'LL BE WIPED OUT INSTANTLY.

238
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,375
- Alastor: THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO IN THIS BATTLE.

239
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,958
THEREFORE, THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO COME WITH US.

240
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:39,291
- OKAY THEN.

241
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,083
- HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE
THING THAT PUZZLES ME.

242
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,083
- Alastor: MAINTAINING A
SEAL OF THIS SIZE

243
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:47,333
REQUIRES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF THE POWER OF EXISTENCE.

244
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:51,791
MORE THAN IS AVAILABLE HERE.
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M GETTING AT?

245
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:54,333
- I THINK SO. YOU'RE SAYING
THERE'S SOME KIND OF DEVICE

246
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,583
OR SOMETHING
HOLDING THIS SEAL UP.

247
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,625
- YES. A TREASURE,
AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD,

248
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,625
OR EVEN SOMETHING
WE'VE NEVER HEARD ABOUT.

249
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,208
- OKAY THEN, I'LL HEAD OUT
AND LOOK FOR IT!

250
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,666
- Alastor: JUST CALM DOWN.

251
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,833
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE
THAT EASY TO FIND.

252
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,916
- DON'T FORGET, OUR OPPONENTS
HAVE CONTROL OVER

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,458
THE ENTIRE CITY.

254
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,125
YOU COULD BE ATTACKED
BY A RINNE,

255
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,250
OR EVEN A DENIZEN,
WITHOUT WARNING.

256
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,541
- DENIZENS AND RINNE. RIGHT.

257
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,625
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP.

258
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,166
- THANKS.

259
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,791
- HEY SHANA,
IF I END UP HELPING YOU,

260
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:31,083
HOW 'BOUT YOU GIVE ME
A LITTLE REWARD?

261
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,500
- A REWARD?

262
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,333
JUST SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

263
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,833
- GET OUTTA HERE!
- RIGHT. SEE YA!

264
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,541
- Alastor: LET'S GO.

265
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,666
- Sorath: LOOK, LOOK TIRIEL!
IT'S THE NIETONO NO SHANA!

266
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,458
THE NIETONO NO
SHANA'S RIGHT THERE!

267
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:02,666
- ( laughs )

268
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,541
- Tiriel: INDEED IT IS,
DEAR BROTHER.

269
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,125
PLEASE, WAIT JUST
A LITTLE LONGER.

270
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:09,875
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

271
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,500
THIS IS ENGULFED IN SELF-LOVE,

272
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,583
AND I'M ENGULFED IN
LOVE FOR OTHERS.

273
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,875
WE'RE ALSO KNOWN
AS SORATH AND TIRIEL.

274
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:19,250
FORGIVE MY ASKING, BUT
WHO ARE YOU IN A CONTRACT WITH?

275
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,583
- I AM THE FLAME HAZE OF
ALASTOR, THE FLAME OF HEAVEN.

276
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,833
I AM THE FLAME-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER, SHANA!

277
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,500
- THE FLAME OF HEAVEN
IS AN OLD NAME

278
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,291
IF I'M NOT VERY MUCH MISTAKEN,

279
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,625
BUT NONE OF THAT
REALLY MATTERS RIGHT NOW.

280
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,375
WE ONLY MADE THIS
LITTLE SIDE TRIP

281
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,875
TO HAVE A BRIEF
MOMENT OF FUN WITH YOU.

282
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:37,541
- SIDE TRIP?

283
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,333
WHO ARE THESE TWO?

284
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,333
UGH, IT'S CREEPY THE WAY THEY'RE
HANGING ON TO EACH OTHER.

285
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,125
- THE REASON WE'RE
HERE IS SIMPLE,

286
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,708
I WANT YOU TO GIVE THAT
SWORD YOU'RE HOLDING

287
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,666
TO MY BROTHER, SORATH.

288
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,500
- YOU WANT ME TO WHAT?

289
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,291
- IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOUR EARS?

290
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,791
OR MAYBE IT'S YOUR BRAIN.

291
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,708
- I SAID I WANT YOU
TO GIVE THAT SWORD...

292
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,041
- I HEARD YOU!

293
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,416
- I WANT THE NIETONO NO SHANA!

294
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,458
- ( grunts )

295
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,958
- ( gasps )

296
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,916
- ( laughs ) SO, TELL ME,

297
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,541
HOW DO YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF
MY BROTHER'S BLOOD SUCKER?

298
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,458
WHEN YOU ADD
POWER OF EXISTENCE TO IT,

299
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,208
YOU CAN INJURE
YOUR OPPONENT BY MERELY

300
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,958
TOUCHING THE
OTHER PERSON'S SWORD.

301
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,500
- THAT IS NOT GOOD.

302
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,708
- Alastor: WE CAN'T
ATTACK RECKLESSLY.

303
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:30,666
- I WANT THE NIETONO
NO SHANA REAL BAD!

304
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,250
WAIT! COME BACK,
NIETONO NO SHANA!

305
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,541
- Tanaka: SO, EVERYONE'S
FROZEN BECAUSE OF

306
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,208
AN UNRESTRICTED METHOD?

307
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,250
- Marco: YEAH, YOU GOTTA HAND IT
TO THOSE PERVERTED SIBLINGS,

308
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,375
THEY THREW THIS WHOLE THING UP,
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

309
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,291
- Sato: UH, WHAT'S THE
SITUATION NOW?

310
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,708
- OUT OF THE THREE
WE RAN INTO YESTERDAY,

311
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,625
TWO OF THEM ARE
FIGHTING THE LITTLE BRAT.

312
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:54,041
THE OTHER ONE IS
SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE CITY.

313
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,000
- SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING?
- WHY SHOULD I GO?

314
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,541
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
IT'S NOT AS IF THEY'RE AFTER ME.

315
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,375
HMM...

316
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,125
- Sato: MISS MARGERY?
- NOW WHAT?

317
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,666
- ONE OF THE TORCHES IS MOVING.
- Marco: WHAT?

318
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,625
- ARE YOU SURE?

319
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:19,250
- OH MAN, WHY DID I SAY
I WANTED TO HELP OUT?

320
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,166
THIS IS CREEPY.

321
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,625
I'D BE SAFE IF
I JUST STAYED HERE.

322
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,750
NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

323
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,000
IF I WANNA HELP THEM,
I HAVE TO GO OUT.

324
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,083
I HOPE NOTHING'S OUT THERE.

325
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,041
- ( gasping )

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,291
- I'M OKAY.

327
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,458
- Alastor: WE UNDERESTIMATED
THEIR ABILITIES.

328
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:47,583
- GIVE ME THE NIETONO NO SHANA.
- YOU CAN FORGET IT!

329
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,375
- ( screams )

330
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,000
- ( laughs )

331
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,375
- AH, WHAT A PLEASANT SIGHT.

332
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,458
- ( panting )

333
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:06,541
- OKAY. HUH? A DENIZEN? RINNE?

334
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,791
- NOW GO, BROTHER,
TAKE IT FROM HER HANDS.

335
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,541
- THE NIETONO NO SHANA,
IT'S MINE!

336
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,916
AT LAST IT'S MINE!
AT LAST IT'S MINE!

337
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,541
MINE ALL MINE!

338
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,208
- NOW!

339
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,208
- ( yelling )

340
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,250
- HUH?

341
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:39,125
- ( screams )

342
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,625
- AH! SORATH, NO!

343
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,791
- YOU'RE NEXT.

344
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,208
- THAT WAS AWESOME!

345
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,041
SO THAT'S THE
NIETONO NO SHANA'S POWER!

346
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,625
YOU'VE GOT A FLAME SWORD!

347
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:53,666
- ( laughs )

348
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,000
- Alastor: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE RECOVERED TOO QUICKLY.

349
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,000
- NOW I GET IT, ALASTOR.

350
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,375
THIS MONSTER'S SEAL IS
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS.

351
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,875
IT'S MORE LIKE A FACTORY
DESIGNED TO SUPPLY THEM WITH AN

352
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,875
UNINTERRUPTED POWER
OF EXISTENCE.

353
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,208
- Alastor: HMM,
THAT MAKES SENSE.

354
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,583
IT WOULD
EXPLAIN THEIR GREAT

355
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:14,041
POWER AND THAT RECOVERY
WE JUST WITNESSED.

356
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,958
- QUESTION IS, WHERE ARE
THESE TWO HIDING

357
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,666
THE REAL SOURCE OF THEIR POWER.

358
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,208
- IT'S UNFORGIVABLE.

359
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,333
TO THINK SOMEONE LIKE YOU
ACTUALLY HURT MY BROTHER,

360
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:24,916
AND THEN THE MOST
HORRENDOUS INSULT OF ALL,

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,250
YOU EVEN STEPPED
ON HIS BEAUTIFUL FACE!

362
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,333
OH YOU POOR DEAR,
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO PAINFUL.

363
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,041
- IT'S AWESOME, TIRIEL,
LIKE I EXPECTED!

364
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,791
THE SWORD IS INCREDIBLE!

365
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,291
- IT'S NICE TO HEAR, BUT YOU'LL
HAVE TO USE THIS SWORD FOR NOW.

366
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,375
WE'LL COLLECT THE OTHER ONE
SOON ENOUGH.

367
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,833
- RIGHT.

368
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,375
- I CAN SENSE IT,

369
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,916
IF I'M RIGHT, THE SOURCE OF
THEIR ENERGY'S SOMEWHERE NEAR.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,250
- Tiriel: COME AND GET US.

371
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,125
IT'S POINTLESS!
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

372
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,250
- I'M CLOSE. THE SECRET THEY
WERE TRYING TO HIDE FROM ME...

373
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,458
IS THERE!

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
- STOP FLAME HAZE!

375
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,250
- ALL I NEED IS ONE SECOND.
ONE BREATH,

376
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,000
ENOUGH STRENGTH TO STRIKE!

377
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,375
YOU WILL BURN!

378
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:31,958
- ( screams )

379
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,500
- ( laughs )

380
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,750
- HUH? NO!

381
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,291
- ( Shana screams )

382
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,125
- ( theme song playing )

383
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,833
- ( singing in Japanese )

384
00:24:56,958 --> 00:25:00,291
- Yuji: SORATH WILL DO ANYTHING
TO ACQUIRE THE NIETONO NO SHANA.

385
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,000
AND TIRIEL WILL DO ANYTHING TO
MAKE SURE HER BROTHER GETS IT.

386
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,291
WHAT DOES SHANA SEE WHEN
THE ENGULFED IN LOVE SIBLINGS

387
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,916
EMBRACE IN FRONT OF HER?

388
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,416
NEXT EPISODE, "BEHIND THE
SCHOOL WAR IS DECLARED."
