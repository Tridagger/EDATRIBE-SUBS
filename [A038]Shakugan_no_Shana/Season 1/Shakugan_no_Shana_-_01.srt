1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,625
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,958
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,166
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,875
AND THE FLAMES OF THE CRIMSON
WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:49,166
- ( theme music playing )

6
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:56,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,500
- Boy:
IT HAPPENED IN MISAKI CITY,

8
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,041
WHEN THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS
WERE IN FULL BLOOM.

9
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:38,208
THEY WERE LATER
THAN USUAL THIS YEAR.

10
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:46,083
MY NAME IS YUJI SAKAI.

11
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,500
THE SCHOOL YEAR HAD JUST BEGUN,
AND I WAS SETTLING

12
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,166
INTO THE DAILY ROUTINE
THAT WAS THE LIFE

13
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,416
OF A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

14
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,875
A MORNING NO DIFFERENT
FROM ANY OTHER.

15
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,708
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

16
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:06,541
DAYS LIKE THAT WERE SUPPOSED
TO LAST FOREVER.

17
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,916
- ( wind howls )
- OOH!

18
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,958
Yuji: AT THE TIME,
I COULDN'T EVEN BEGIN

19
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,166
TO IMAGINE WHAT
WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

20
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,166
I HAD NO INKLING
OF THIS STRANGE,

21
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,708
DIVERGENT WORLD I WAS SOON
TO ENCOUNTER

22
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,125
OR OF THE FACT
THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE.

23
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,416
- ( crashing )

24
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,125
- ( snarling )

25
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:10,500
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT IS THIS?

26
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,750
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:14,875
AAH!

28
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,791
- IT'S YUM-YUM TIME.

29
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,083
( shrieking )

30
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,041
- AND THEN, I SAW HER.

31
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:37,208
THE GIRL WITH THE FLAME RED
HAIR AND BLAZING EYES.

32
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,708
( gasping )

33
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,208
Yuji:
THAT WAS THE DAY MY WORLD

34
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,125
CHANGED FOREVER.

35
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
Yuji: THE DAY BEGAN WHEN 
I MET UP WITH HAYATO IKE,

36
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,125
A BUDDY FROM JUNIOR HIGH.

37
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:23,416
MY LAST MORNING
WAS JUST SO NORMAL.

38
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,291
- HEY, SAKAI!
( panting )

39
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,666
- HMM?  HI.

40
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,041
IT DOESN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE

41
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,083
I'VE MOVED UP TO HIGH
SCHOOL WITH YOU HERE.

42
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:36,500
YOU KNOW,
NOTHING'S CHANGED, REALLY.

43
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,166
- HEY, DON'T MAKE IT MY FAULT.
I MEAN, YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH.

44
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,708
YOU COULD'VE GONE ANYWHERE.

45
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,500
- YEAH, BUT I'D RATHER STICK
CLOSE TO HOME.

46
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,500
- IT'S A BIT UNFAIR YOU GOT
TO CHOOSE THIS SCHOOL

47
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,666
FOR THAT REASON.

48
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,875
I MEAN, MY MARKS WERE
BARELY GOOD ENOUGH

49
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,125
TO GET ME IN THE DOOR.

50
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,458
- YOU SAY THAT,
BUT YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON

51
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:54,458
WHO ALWAYS FINDS SOME WAY
TO GET WHAT HE WANTS.

52
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:58,458
- MAYBE I'M JUST LUCKY.
- MAYBE YOU'RE JUST SHREWD.

53
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:01,416
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

54
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,583
MY HEAD WAS FILLED
WITH THOUGHTS OF HIGH SCHOOL

55
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:06,458
AND WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE.

56
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,791
HUH?

57
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,125
- YO!

58
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,166
- OH, UH, GOOD MORNING!

59
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,791
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO YELL.

60
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,083
- WHOA, HE'S JUST
A LITTLE STANDOFFISH.

61
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,208
- THAT'S SATO. I HEAR HE WAS
A REAL TROUBLEMAKER

62
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,250
IN JUNIOR HIGH.

63
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,000
BUT YOU SEE THAT JOCK
NEXT TO HIM?

64
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,333
I THINK HIS NAME IS TANAKA.

65
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,666
ANYWAY, SATO'S REALLY
CALMED DOWN A LOT

66
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,958
SINCE THEY
STARTED HANGING OUT.

67
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,500
- REALLY?

68
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,333
- I'VE MET GUYS
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

69
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:39,166
THEY THINK WE'RE JUST A COUPLE
OF BORING HONOR STUDENTS,

70
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,125
NOT EVEN WORTH TALKING TO.
- WE'RE HONOR STUDENTS?

71
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,125
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE YOU ARE,
BUT I'M SURE NOT.

72
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,875
- WELL, IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE
ONE OR TWO GUYS IN A CLASS

73
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,166
WHO JUST DON'T FIT IN,

74
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,041
SO THERE'S NO USE
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

75
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:53,583
- YEAH.

76
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,750
SCHOOL HAD STARTED A WEEK AGO.

77
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,916
THOUGH IT WASN'T 
A NON-STOP PARTY,

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,291
AT LEAST IT WASN'T A BOTTOMLESS
PIT OF DESPAIR, EITHER.

79
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,416
I HAD A NORMAL LIFE, AND THINGS
WERE STARTING TO LOOK PROMISING.

80
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,791
THANKS.

81
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:33,208
THERE WERE SOME PRETTY CUTE
GIRLS IN THOSE CLASSES.

82
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,500
FROM A MALE POINT-OF-VIEW,

83
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,291
THINGS WERE DEFINITELY
LOOKING UP.

84
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,000
- Teacher: SAKAI?
- HUH?

85
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,583
- YUJI SAKAI, RIGHT?
- YES, YES, I AM.

86
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,791
- WELL, WHAT WERE YOU STARING
OFF INTO SPACE FOR?

87
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,500
READ THE NEXT PART.

88
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,375
- I, UH--
- Boy: BUSTED!

89
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,875
- ( class murmuring )
- Boy: WATCH THIS!

90
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,791
"MY FATHER HAD JUST RETURNED
FROM TOKYO.

91
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,125
I WAS TO START ATTENDING
THE SCHOOL BUILT

92
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,416
WHERE THE FAMILY STUDY CENTER
ONCE STOOD.

93
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,625
AND I WOULD HAVE TO MAKE
THE LONG WALK EVERY DAY.

94
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,875
TO GET TO THE SCHOOL FROM HOME,
I HAD TO PASS THROUGH A WICKET 

95
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:11,083
THAT WAS BUILT
INTO OUR WEST GATE.

96
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,416
THERE'S STILL THE REMAINS OF
A GUARD HOUSE NEAR THE WICKET.

97
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,708
A MAN IN HIS 50s LIVES THERE
WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILD."

98
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,833
WELL, THINGS WENT ON AS USUAL,

99
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,916
BUT I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,500
I HAD NO IDEA MY LIFE
WAS SO FRAGILE.

101
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,041
ALL IT TOOK WAS FIVE MINUTES

102
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:30,416
FOR IT TO COLLAPSE
AND COME UNDONE.

103
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,625
- ( maniacal laughing )

104
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,875
- Yuji: GOT ANY PLANS?

105
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,083
- Ike: SAMPLE EXAM
AT MY PREP SCHOOL.

106
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,083
- PREP SCHOOL?  YOU'RE PREPARING
FOR UNIVERSITY ALREADY?

107
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,125
- WELL, I GOTTA MAKE
MY PARENTS HAPPY.

108
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,458
SEE, MY ALLOWANCE DEPENDS
ON IT.  AND YOU?

109
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,375
- HMM.
I'VE GOT SOME FREE TIME.

110
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,125
I THINK I'LL CHECK OUT THE CDs
BY THE TRAIN STATION.

111
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:55,083
- SEE YA.

112
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:59,041
- Yuji:
THINKING BACK, I WONDER

113
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,958
HOW THINGS WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT
IF I'D GONE STRAIGHT HOME.

114
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,000
WOULD MY FATE HAVE BEEN THE SAME
IF I'D BEEN SOMEPLACE ELSE?

115
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,958
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
AT THE TIME

116
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:18,000
THAT I WAS ONLY A FEW METERS
AWAY FROM THE SPOT

117
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,500
WHERE THE WORLD WAS
GOING TO BE DISPLACED.

118
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
- ( grunting )

119
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,416
- HUH?
- OH.

120
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
- HI.  I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
LIVED OUT THIS WAY, SAKAI.

121
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,666
- NO, I JUST CAME IN HERE
TO LOOK AT THE CDs.

122
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,833
I LIVE IN OGAWA CHO.
- WOW, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

123
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:54,000
I LIVE IN AIZAWA CHO.
JUST AFTER SHIN MISAKIDORI.

124
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,500
- WOW, THAT'S REALLY CLOSE.
- YEP.

125
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:02,291
- OH, BY THE WAY, THANKS FOR
 THE HELP IN LANGUAGE CLASS.

126
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,958
- WELL, SOMETIMES I DON'T
PAY ATTENTION, EITHER.

127
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:09,000
- COVER FOR ME NEXT TIME.
- YOU GOT IT.

128
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,916
- I COULDN'T HELP NOTICING,

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,041
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IKE'S
WITH YOU TODAY.

130
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,833
- NO, HE COULDN'T MAKE IT,
'CAUSE HE'S GOT PREP SCHOOL.

131
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,000
WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING.

132
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,458
IT'S JUST YOU'RE
ALWAYS TOGETHER.

133
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,583
- WE'RE NOT ALWAYS TOGETHER.

134
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,333
- HEY, SAKAI.
I WAS SORT OF WONDERING.

135
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,458
DO YOU KNOW IF IKE HAS
A GIRLFRIEND OR ANYTHING?

136
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,125
- NO, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

137
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,500
- HMM.  I SEE.

138
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:42,875
- WELL, I THINK I'M GONNA DROP
BY THE STATION BUILDING.

139
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,750
- OKAY, TAKE IT EASY.

140
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,333
- I GET IT.
SHE LIKES IKE.

141
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,666
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW
HE REACTS TO THIS.

142
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,458
- ( distant shrieking )

143
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,083
HMM?

144
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:14,500
- ( laughing )
- COME BACK HERE, YOU SCAMP.

145
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,375
- HEY, KID, WATCH OUT!

146
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,666
THIS CAN'T BE.

147
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,291
WHAT THE-- WHAT? 
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

148
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:33,541
( gasps )
- OKAY, I'M READY.

149
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,916
- THERE AREN'T AS MANY
AS I FIRST THOUGHT.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,583
BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE THAN
ENOUGH.  LET THE FEAST BEGIN.

151
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,416
- YEAH, LET'S EAT!
LET'S EAT!

152
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,791
( gasps )

153
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,416
- SO YUMMY.
TASTE SO YUMMY!

154
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,458
- YOU MUSTN'T TALK WHILE YOU'RE
EATING.  IT'S BAD MANNERS.

155
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,291
- SORRY.

156
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,750
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

157
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,833
WHAT IS THIS?

158
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,833
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

159
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,250
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

160
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,833
HIRAI!
- HELLO.

161
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,666
- WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

162
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,583
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A DENIZEN.

163
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,166
- AND HE'S MOVING AROUND INSIDE
THE SEALED ZONE.

164
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,875
- AH, HE'S A MYSTES!

165
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,750
- WHAT?  A MYSTES?

166
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,750
ONE OF THOSE TORCHES
WITH TREASURE IN IT?

167
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,041
- YES, AND A RARE SPECIMEN
AT THAT.

168
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:54,000
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE
WE'VE FOUND SUCH A GIFT.

169
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,750
THE MASTER WILL BE PLEASED.

170
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:59,916
- OH, BOY!
COMING HERE WAS A GREAT IDEA.

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,833
- AAH!
- I GOTCHA! ( laughs )

172
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,583
IT'S YUM-YUM TIME.

173
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,333
( shrieks )

174
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,833
- WHO DID THAT?

175
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,791
- WHO-- WHO IS THIS GIRL?

176
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:31,541
- SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
ALASTOR?

177
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,375
- HMM, THEY'RE NOT ALLIES.
THEY'RE ONLY RINNE.

178
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,833
- ( Rinne shrieks )

179
00:14:37,916 --> 00:14:40,833
YOU CUT MY ARM OFF!

180
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,958
- ( gasps )
- I'LL CRUSH YOU.

181
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,291
- ( screams )

182
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,708
WHAT?  WHO-- WHO--
WHO IS SHE?

183
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:17,166
OH, NO!
NOW PUPI KNOW YOU.

184
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,625
( screaming )
DON'T DO IT! 

185
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,791
- ALL I DID WAS DESTROY
ITS SHELL.

186
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,875
- ITS REAL BODY ESCAPED
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

187
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,708
- IT COULD STILL BE CLOSE BY.

188
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,583
- IS THIS A MYSTES?

189
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,208
- A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL ONE,
I SEE.

190
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,791
- ( gasps ) A WHAT?

191
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,666
( gasps )
- ( grunts )

192
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,291
( screams )

193
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,750
- SO THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE
THAT MYSTES

194
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,208
THAT YOU REALLY WANTED.

195
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,291
- FLAMING HAIR, BLAZING EYES.

196
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:17,291
YOU'RE ALASTOR'S FLAME HAZE,
HE WHO IS THE FLAME OF HEAVEN.

197
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,875
JUST A TOOL FOR DESTRUCTION.

198
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,041
- THAT'S RIGHT, AND SO WHAT?

199
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,958
- MY MASTER WILL NOT BE PLEASED
WHEN HE HEARS OF THIS.

200
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:29,291
- TOO BAD.  HE'LL BE SCREAMING
IN HIS LAST MOMENTS BEFORE LONG.

201
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,458
- DAMN YOU!
- BUT THIS IS NOW.

202
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,916
YOU CAN DO
THE SCREAMING INSTEAD.

203
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,541
- NO!  WAIT A MINUTE.

204
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,083
- HMM.
- HUH?

205
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,375
( gasps )

206
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,625
( panting ) WHAT--

207
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,208
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

208
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:52,708
IT'S INSIDE ME
REACHING FOR SOMETHING.

209
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,750
STOP IT.

210
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,166
- ( screams )

211
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,083
- I'VE BEEN CUT.
I'VE BEEN CUT!

212
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:19,083
- SO THAT'S ITS TRUE FORM.
- BEHIND YOU.

213
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
- ( shrieking )

214
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,500
- IT'S ESCAPED FOR NOW,
BUT FROM WHAT IT SAID,

215
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,625
THERE SEEMS TO BE A POWERFUL
ENTITY SOMEWHERE IN THE SHADOWS.

216
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:50,916
- WE MAY BE ABLE TO SEAL THE
KING OF THE CRIMSON WORLD AGAIN.

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,250
- IN ANY CASE.

218
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,541
- HELP ME.

219
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,166
- I WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE.

220
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:00,000
I'D FORGOTTEN THAT THING
WAS STILL MOVING AROUND.

221
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,291
- INDEED, FOR A MOMENT THERE,

222
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,000
I WAS REMINDED
OF TENMOKU IKKO.

223
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,791
- YES, BUT WE KNEW FROM
THE VERY BEGINNING THAT

224
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,458
THAT ONE COULD MOVE
AND FIGHT FREELY.

225
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,458
- PLEASE.
I NEED AN AMBULANCE.

226
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,458
- SO NOISY.  JUST SHUT UP.
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

227
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,416
IT'S USELESS
CRYING OVER A CUT NOW.

228
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,958
- IT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EXISTENCE
WHEN IT WAS ALIVE.

229
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,166
IF IT WAS HUMAN,
IT WOULD HAVE DIED THE MOMENT

230
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,791
IT RECEIVED A CUT THAT DEEP.

231
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,125
- IF I WAS HUMAN?

232
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,583
I HAVE TO STOP
THE BLEEDING BEFORE--

233
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,041
THE BLEEDING?
WHERE'S THE BLOOD?

234
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,583
THERE'S NO PAIN.
- ( scoffs )

235
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,958
- ( gasps )

236
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,583
( shouts )
I'M ON FIRE!  HUH?

237
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,583
BUT I JUST--
- NOW LET'S SEE...

238
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,375
- HUH?  OH, NO!  HIRAI!

239
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,541
GOOD.  SHE'S OKAY. 
MAN, WHAT A RELIEF.

240
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,500
- I STILL HAVE TO
FIX THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

241
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,458
BUT THAT SHOULD DO IT
FOR THE TORCHES.

242
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,416
- HMM, THEY WERE CONSUMING THEM
WITHOUT RESTRAINT.

243
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,375
- IT LOOKS LIKE THEIR MASTER
HAS QUITE THE APPETITE.

244
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,291
I'M DONE.

245
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:09,083
- EVERYONE'S STILL WALKING
AROUND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

246
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,125
HUH?  HIRAI!

247
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,208
HIRAI!  WAIT FOR ME!

248
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,916
( gasps )

249
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,625
WHAT?  WHAT IS THAT?

250
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,083
HIRAI.  HUH?

251
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,416
THAT KID.  BUT WHY?

252
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,708
DOES THIS MEAN--

253
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,166
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE!

254
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,500
WHAT JUST HAPPENED BACK THERE?

255
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,041
WHERE DID THAT GIRL
FROM BEFORE DISAPPEAR TO?

256
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,125
AND THOSE FLAMES ON EVERYONE--

257
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,083
- HEY, STOP BUGGIN' ME,
ALL RIGHT?

258
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,416
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID
OF THIS ONE, ALASTOR.

259
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,291
- BUT WHAT ARE YOU-- 
- NO, WE MUSTN'T OPEN

260
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,958
A MYSTES CARELESSLY.

261
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,125
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ALL
THE TROUBLE TENMOKU IKKO CAUSED?

262
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,416
- I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT IT KEEPS BUGGING ME.

263
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,250
- JUST TELL IT THE TRUTH.

264
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,500
IT'S THE BEST WAY
TO SHUT IT UP.

265
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,291
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

266
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,250
YOU KEEP CALLING ME "IT"
LIKE I'M SOME THING.

267
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,833
- YES, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ARE A THING.

268
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,250
- YOU'RE NOT HUMAN.
- ( gasps )

269
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,583
- IT'S NOT ONLY YOU.

270
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,291
EVERYONE WALKING AROUND
WITH A FLAME

271
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,333
IN THEIR BODY IS A THING.

272
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,708
THEY ARE REPLACEMENTS OF PEOPLE
WHO HAD THEIR EXISTENCE CONSUMED

273
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,916
BY DENIZENS
OF THE CRIMSON WORLD.

274
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,791
THEY'RE TORCHES.
- THEY'RE REPLACEMENTS?

275
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,708
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

276
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,833
- THIS WORLD'S BALANCE
WOULD BE DISRUPTED

277
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,750
IF THEY DISAPPEARED
TOO SUDDENLY.

278
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,208
THEREFORE, REPLACEMENTS
FOR THOSE PEOPLE ARE PROVIDED

279
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,208
TO SOFTEN THE IMPACT.
THEY'RE TEMPORARY.

280
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:54,583
- BUT THEN
YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE--

281
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,625
- I'M VERY SORRY, MASTER.

282
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,458
I LOST ONE
OF YOUR PRECIOUS RINNE.

283
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,583
- YOU'VE NOTHING TO
BE SORRY FOR, MARIANNE.

284
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,291
BEING ATTACKED BY A FLAME HAZE
CAN BE LIKENED

285
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,625
TO ENCOUNTERING
A NATURAL DISASTER.

286
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,125
- PLEASE,
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.

287
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,458
- I SHALL,
BUT THERE'S NO NEED TO HURRY.

288
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,916
YOU MUST BE TIRED.
GET SOME REST FIRST.

289
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,208
GOOD NIGHT,
MY OH-SO-ADORABLE MARIANNE.

290
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:32,208
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

291
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,166
( kisses )

292
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,750
HAIR AFLAME, EYES ABLAZE.

293
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,750
- Yuji: I'M NOT ALIVE?
- NO.

294
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,083
THE REAL YOU HAS HAD
ITS EXISTENCE CONSUMED

295
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,625
AND IS NO LONGER LIVING.

296
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,625
RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT RESIDUE.

297
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:52,458
- ( gasping )

298
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:01,166
I-- I DON'T EXIST ANYMORE.

299
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,333
Yuji: THAT DAY

300
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:17,666
THAT STARTED
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER DAY,

301
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,500
THE DAY THAT I FOUND OUT
I WAS DEAD.

302
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,083
- ( theme music playing )
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

303
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:58,791
- Yuji:
I AM ALREADY DEAD.

304
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:02,625
AND EVEN AS I TRY TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS,

305
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,875
A YOUNG GIRL FINDS HERSELF
ON THE VERGE

306
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,833
OF DISAPPEARING AS WELL.

307
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:10,666
NEXT EPISODE--
"THE LIT FLAME."
