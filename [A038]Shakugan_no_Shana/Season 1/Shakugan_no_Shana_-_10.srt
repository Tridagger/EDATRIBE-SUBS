1
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,750
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,083
LIVES CONSUMED
IN SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.

3
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:41,250
NO ONE CAN TELL
WHEN THE WORLD IS DISPLACED

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,916
AND THE FLAMES OF THE
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,791
- ( theme song playing )

6
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,375
- ( woman singing in Japanese )

7
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,291
- Yuji: SHANA AND I WERE
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

8
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,541
IN FACT, YOU COULD SAY
THINGS WERE ALMOST NORMAL.

9
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:27,500
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I EVEN
FORGOT SHE WAS A FLAME HAZE,

10
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,000
AND WAS LOOKING MORE LIKE AN
ORDINARY GIRL TO ME EVERY DAY.

11
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,416
BUT THE TRAINING
THAT I HAD BEGUN

12
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,041
AFTER OUR BATTLE WITH FRIAGNE
WAS STILL ONGOING.

13
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,083
THOSE LESSONS BROUGHT ME
AND MY WANDERING THOUGHTS

14
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,291
BACK TO REALITY
PRETTY QUICKLY.

15
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,916
OW!

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,500
THEN I'D REMEMBER THAT IS A
STRONG, EXPERIENCED FLAME HAZE.

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:02,375
( grunting )

18
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,166
- YOU'RE LATE.

19
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,333
- SORRY.

20
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,041
- LET'S BEGIN,
SAME AS YESTERDAY.

21
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,708
SENSE THE KILL
AND AVOID THE ATTACK.

22
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,333
- YOU KNOW, THAT LOOKED GOOD
ON HER.

23
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,166
( grunting )

24
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,375
- STOP DAYDREAMING!
- I-- I WASN'T.

25
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,208
HEY!

26
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:38,083
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
KEEP HITTING ME SO HARD, SHANA.

27
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:40,500
- LOOK, IT'S POINTLESS
UNLESS I USE SOME FORCE.

28
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,875
IF YOU DON'T LIKE GETTING HIT,
YOU SHOULD LEARN TO AVOID IT.

29
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,708
- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
KEEPING MY EYES OPEN.

30
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,041
ONE THING AT A TIME, OKAY?

31
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,166
- I CAN SEE THAT YOU'RE
STARTING TO FEEL THE KILL,

32
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,375
SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE
TO SENSE A SIMPLE ATTACK.

33
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,291
IT'S LIKE PLAYING ROCK,
PAPER, SCISSORS

34
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,375
WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW
WHAT YOUR OPPONENT WILL DO.

35
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:58,000
- ( chuckles )
- WHAT'S FUNNY?

36
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,375
- ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

37
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,916
YOU JUST LEARNED TO PLAY THAT
A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,875
NOW YOU TALK LIKE AN EXPERT.

39
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:05,583
- SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

40
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,708
JUST STOP TALKING NONSENSE
DURING OUR TRAINING!

41
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,250
- ( grunting )
- HEY, HOW 'BOUT A WARNING?!

42
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,375
- ATTACKS ALWAYS COME
WITHOUT WARNING!

43
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:16,250
- BUT THAT'S TOO FAST!
AH!

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,166
- Alastor:
GOODNESS, YOU'RE CLUMSY.

45
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,541
- IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING NONSENSE

46
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,916
THAT YOU END UP
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,375
- I ASKED YOU TO WAIT.

48
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:28,333
JEEZ, WOULD IT HAVE KILLED
YOU TO HOLD BACK FOR A BIT?

49
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,541
- AN ENEMY WILL
NOT WAIT FOR YOU.

50
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,333
- I KNOW THAT, BUT COME ON!

51
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,583
THIS IS A TRAINING SESSION,
REMEMBER?

52
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,833
- Alastor: EXCUSES
ARE FOR THE INCOMPETENT.

53
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,250
- ( grunting )

54
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,875
OH, BOY, MY PANTS.

55
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,916
- IF THAT WAS A DENIZEN,
YOU'D BE EATEN BY NOW.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,958
- YEAH, WHATEVER.
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

57
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,666
I GOTTA GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

58
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,041
- YUJI.

59
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:58,666
- OH, WHERE'S YU-CHAN?
ARE YOU DONE ALREADY?

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,166
- I GUESS THE TRAINING
WASN'T GOING HIS WAY.

61
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,708
SO HE DECIDED TO END IT
EARLY.

62
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:07,208
- LOOKS LIKE HE GOT
KNOCKED AROUND A BIT.

63
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,666
- HE'S BEEN IN WORSE SHAPE
ON OTHER DAYS.

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,500
BUT IT'S NEVER BOTHERED HIM
LIKE THIS.

65
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,541
- MAYBE HE'S REALIZING HOW
AWKWARD HE LOOKS

66
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,916
COMPARED TO YOU.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,208
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN AWKWARD?
- YOU'RE A CUTE GIRL,

68
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,250
YOU WEAR A DRESS,
AND YOU'RE SMALLER THAN HE IS.

69
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,041
FROM A BOY'S POINT OF VIEW,

70
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,916
BEING BEATEN UP BY A GIRL
CAN BE PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,458
- WELL, I CAN'T CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I'M STRONGER THAN HE IS.

72
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,416
- BUT BOYS HAVE A TENDENCY
TO SHOW OFF IN FRONT OF OTHERS,

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,666
ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF GIRLS
THEY'RE TRYING TO IMPRESS.

74
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,333
- YUJI'S TRYING TO IMPRESS ME?

75
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,791
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE...

76
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,000
- HAVE A NICE DAY,
YOU TWO!

77
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,916
- SO HERE'S THE PLAN--
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL,

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,041
I'M GONNA SET UP A SEAL SO WE
CAN PRACTICE SOME BIGGER MOVES.

79
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,875
- HUH.

80
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,583
IT'S YOUR CALL,

81
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:12,250
BUT SHOULD WE BE WORKING
ON COMPLICATED MOVES THIS SOON?

82
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,708
- IT'S PART OF YOUR TRAINING,
SO I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

83
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,958
- WELL,
I GUESS YOU WOULD KNOW.

84
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,333
- BEING BEATEN UP BY A GIRL
CAN BE PRETTY EMBARRASSING.

85
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,791
- AS YOUR TRAINING PROGRESSES,
YOU'LL BE LESS EMBARRASSING.

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,500
- IS THAT YOUR WAY
OF ENCOURAGING ME?

87
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,583
- I'M JUST TELLING YOU
THE WAY THINGS STAND.

88
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:36,291
- WHICH MEANS I LOOK
REALLY LAME RIGHT NOW.

89
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,250
- HMM.

90
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,333
- Girl: WHAT IS HE DOING?

91
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,333
- ( laughs ) HUH?

92
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,791
- Shana: IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU LOOK.

93
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,875
YUJI, WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT YOU GET STRONGER,

94
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:10,375
SO THAT WE CAN FIGHT TOGETHER.
YOU HAVE TO GET MUCH STRONGER.

95
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,291
 OH, HERE,
I'VE GOT ONE YEN.

96
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:17,958
- ( bells tolling )

97
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:21,166
- YOU BUYIN' LUNCH TODAY?
- MM-HMM.

98
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,958
- SO HOW'S BIG SISTER?
- ABOUT THE SAME.

99
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,500
- TOO BAD.

100
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,958
I GUESS WHEN SHE'S FEELING
A BIT BETTER,

101
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,750
SHE'S GONNA TAKE OFF
AND LEAVE THE CITY.

102
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:34,458
- MAYBE.

103
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,083
- DON'T GET ME WRONG!

104
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,458
I REALLY WANT BIG SISTER
TO GET BETTER, HONESTLY!

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,375
I SWEAR IT!
- YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

106
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,125
- OH, MAN, I'M STARVING.

107
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,750
- MMM.
- OGATA!

108
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,416
- ( gasps )
- YOU WANNA COME EAT WITH US?

109
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,125
- UH, SURE.

110
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,166
- MMM!

111
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,208
DID YOU MAKE THESE, KAZUMI?
THEY LOOK GREAT!

112
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,000
- I AM AMAZED!

113
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,583
- I GOT THE RECIPE
FROM MY FRIEND,

114
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,500
SO I THOUGHT
I'D GIVE IT A TRY.

115
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,416
- Ogata:
WHY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,625
PLEASE,
OR DON'T YOU LIKE THESE?

117
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,833
- SURE, I'LL HAVE ONE.
THANK YOU.

118
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:16,166
- WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?

119
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,166
- SURE, THANK YOU.

120
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,041
- Ogata: DELICIOUS!

121
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,625
- WOW, THIS IS WAY BETTER
THAN STORE-BOUGHT.

122
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,375
- YEP, TASTY!
- OH, YOU REALLY THINK SO?

123
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,083
- YOU KNOW, YOSHIDA,
YOU'RE A GOOD COOK.

124
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,833
- OH, NO,
I JUST REALLY LOVE BAKING.

125
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:42,541
- IT'S GOOD,
BUT I'M NOT ENJOYING IT.

126
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,625
- EXCUSE ME, ARE THERE
ANY LIBRARY COMMITTEE MEMBERS?

127
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,291
- OVER HERE!
THAT'S THE TWO OF US.

128
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:51,541
- DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
THEY'VE CHANGED THE SCHEDULE

129
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,708
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE
RESTACKING THE BOOKS TODAY.

130
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,250
REPORT TO THE LIBRARY
AFTER SCHOOL.

131
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,750
- WHAT, YOU MEAN TODAY?

132
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,000
- EVERY CLASS
HAS TO SEND TWO PEOPLE,

133
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:03,000
SO IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT, TRY TO
FIND SOMEONE TO GO FOR YOU.

134
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,416
- YOU CAN'T GO?
- NO, MY FAMILY AND I

135
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,333
ARE VISITING MY GRANDMA
IN THE HOSPITAL.  SHE'S SICK.

136
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,041
- REALLY.

137
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,208
- HUH?  WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE HER PLACE, SAKAI,

138
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,791
AND YOU GO WITH YOSHIDA?
- I HAVE PREP SCHOOL TODAY,

139
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,208
BUT YOU'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING, RIGHT?

140
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,958
- I'M FREE.
- WELL, THAT'S IT THEN!

141
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:26,416
ARE YOU FINE WITH THAT, YOSHIDA?
- BUT I'D BE IMPOSING.

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,041
- WE HAVE TO SEND TWO
PEOPLE ANYWAY. I'LL DO IT.

143
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,833
- Ogata: OH, THANK YOU.
I OWE YOU ONE!

144
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,458
- NO, HE CAN'T MAKE IT.
- All: HUH?

145
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,833
- BUT WHY NOT?
- MMM.

146
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,833
- HUH?  OH.

147
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,500
- TODAY AFTER SCHOOL
I'M GONNA SET UP A SEAL

148
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,875
SO WE CAN PRACTICE
SOME BIGGER MOVES.

149
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,041
- WHAT?
DO YOU HAVE PREVIOUS PLANS?

150
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,250
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
I JUST REMEMBERED

151
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,500
THAT I ASKED HIRAI
TO SHOW ME HER NOTES LATER.

152
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:57,041
SORRY, BUT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IT
SOME OTHER TIME.

153
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,541
- SHE SEEMS UPSET.

154
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,208
- I WAS THE ONE WHO ASKED HER.

155
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,958
I'LL GO APOLOGIZE PROPERLY.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,500
SHANA, I'M SORRY,

157
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,958
BUT IT HAS TO DO
WITH THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE.

158
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,250
WE CAN DO OUR TRAINING
LATER ON THIS EVENING.

159
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:30,416
- I THINK I MADE IT CLEAR WE
WERE GONNA DO IT AFTER SCHOOL.

160
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
- I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
- YOU COULD HAVE REFUSED.

161
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,250
- LOOK, I ALREADY SAID I'D GO.
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

162
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,416
- GETTING YOU TRAINED
IS MORE IMPORTANT.

163
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
- SURE, BUT...
SCHOOL'S IMPORTANT TOO.

164
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,708
- THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT!
AND WE AGREED FIRST.

165
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,291
- HEY,
I ALREADY SAID I'M SORRY.

166
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:50,291
- YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO ASKED TO BE TRAINED, YUJI.

167
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:53,750
- I KNOW,
BUT IT'S JUST ONE DAY!

168
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:57,291
- AH!  YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS
ENOUGH ABOUT THIS.

169
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,708
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TODAY.

170
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,541
- AND WHY NOT?

171
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,333
- I JUST DON'T!

172
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,583
- YEAH, WELL, THAT'S NOT A
GOOD ENOUGH REASON!

173
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,500
I'M HELPING OUT
THE COMMITTEE TODAY.

174
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,666
- LISTEN, YUJI,
YOU REALLY HAVE TO TRAIN MORE.

175
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,083
HONESTLY, YOU'RE JUST TOO WEAK,
AND YOU'RE SO DAMNED CLUMSY.

176
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,875
YOU'RE WORSE THAN USELESS,

177
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,791
YOU CAN'T EVEN HELP
ME RIGHT NOW.

178
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,291
- HMM?
- AND THAT'S WHY--

179
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,583
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

180
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,958
- YUJI.

181
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,208
- Ogata: HOW WAS HIRAI?

182
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,083
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.
SHE WASN'T THAT UPSET.

183
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,958
WE TALKED AND SHE JUST GOT
A FEW THINGS OFF OF HER MIND.

184
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,708
- THAT'S GOOD.

185
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,250
- GUESS YOU'LL BE STAYING LATE
WITH SAKAI, YOSHIDA.

186
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,333
- YEAH.

187
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,166
- ( bird tweeting )

188
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:07,083
- Chigusa: AH, SHANA-CHAN,
ARE YOU ALONE? WHERE'S YUJI?

189
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,625
- HUH?  OH, HE'S GOT SOME KIND
OF COMMITTEE MEETING.

190
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,791
- OH.
DO YOU WANNA WAIT INSIDE?

191
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,166
I MADE SOME DELICIOUS PUDDING.

192
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,916
- HMM?

193
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,125
- SO YOU LIVE ALONE, DON'T YOU?
THAT MUST BE HARD.

194
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,083
- NO, I'M USED TO IT.

195
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:30,041
MMM, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.
CHIGUSA'S IS MUCH BETTER.

196
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,500
- GOOD.
GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

197
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,083
YOU KNOW, SHANA-CHAN,

198
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,666
YOU SHOULD STAY
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

199
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,958
- HUH?

200
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,791
- DAMN.

201
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,583
- WHAT'LL I DO?

202
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,875
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WALK HOME TOGETHER.

203
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,416
WE'LL HAVE TO TALK.

204
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,125
WHAT IF I RUN OUT OF THINGS
TO SAY?

205
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,583
AH!
- HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

206
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,041
- UH-HUH.

207
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,083
- Girl:
HEY, I JUST HEARD ABOUT THIS.

208
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,958
YOU KNOW HIRAI FROM CLASS TWO?

209
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,083
SHE'S BEEN GETTING HUNDREDS
ON ALL OF HER TESTS.

210
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:13,250
- I KNOW!  AND SHE'S TOP
OF THE CLASS IN PHYS ED TOO.

211
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,458
GUESS PEOPLE LIKE HER
DO EXIST.

212
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,375
- UM, I, UH...

213
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:23,833
- YES?

214
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:25,833
- WELL, I-- NOTHING.

215
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,916
I HAVE TO ASK HIM
ABOUT YUKARI.

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,083
IF I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IT
LIKE THIS, I'M GONNA GO CRAZY.

217
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,708
I REALLY HAVE TO KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YUKARI?

218
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:43,208
- WHAT?
- MMM.

219
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,666
THOSE GIRLS FROM CLASS THREE
WERE TALKING ABOUT HER.

220
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,333
SHE'S COOL, ISN'T SHE?
- UM, YEAH.

221
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,625
SHE'S SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT.

222
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,000
SHE SURE IS.

223
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,583
IT'S A LITTLE OVERWHELMING.

224
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,083
- IDIOT.  IDIOT!

225
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,708
SHOW A LITTLE BACKBONE.

226
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,166
- Yuji: I'M HOME!

227
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,958
HUH?
- THAT WAS A LONG DAY FOR YOU.

228
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,458
WE ALREADY HAD SUPPER,

229
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,833
AND SHANA-CHAN
EVEN HAD TIME TO TAKE A BATH.

230
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,458
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
THIS DRESS WAS MINE,

231
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,625
BUT I CONVINCED HER
TO TRY IT ON FOR SIZE.

232
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,250
- UH, YEAH,
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

233
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,250
- IT'S GETTING LATE. YOU SHOULD
WALK HER HOME NOW, YU-CHAN.

234
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:28,125
- MOM SURE WOULD BE SHOCKED
IF SHE FOUND OUT

235
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,666
YOU WERE ACTUALLY STAYING IN MY
ROOM AT NIGHT, WOULDN'T SHE?

236
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,250
SHANA?

237
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,958
- WE'LL BEGIN TODAY'S TRAINING.

238
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,666
- NO WAY.
FORGET IT.  IT'S TOO LATE.

239
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,458
- HUH?  YUJI.

240
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,083
- SEE YA.

241
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,500
- WHY?

242
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,791
- Alastor: IT SEEMS
WHEN YOU GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT,

243
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,833
HE DOESN'T QUITE
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

244
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,541
- IF ONLY A DENIZEN
WOULD SHOW UP.

245
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,125
EVEN ANOTHER FLAME HAZE.

246
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,250
IF WE HAD TO FIGHT,
THEN I'M SURE YUJI WOULD FOCUS.

247
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,250
HUH?  A SEAL.

248
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,541
BUT WHAT?

249
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:39,416
- POWER OF EXISTENCE!
MY SWEET POWER OF EXISTENCE!

250
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,541
AAH!

251
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,875
- Marco: WHAT'S THIS?

252
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,291
IS THAT A RINNE?
- FEELS LIKE IT.

253
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,583
- Marco: WHAT A PATHETIC EXCUSE
FOR A SEAL.

254
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,625
ARE YOU GONNA GO?

255
00:15:56,708 --> 00:16:00,000
- I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT,
BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER ANY RHYMES.

256
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,750
- Marco: WHAT?

257
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,208
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YOU'RE THE CHANTER OF ELEGIES!

258
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,875
- IT'S THE TRUTH
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

259
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,666
I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE VERSE.
I'M IN ROUGH SHAPE.

260
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,666
HUH?

261
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,291
THERE YOU GO.

262
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,250
WE'LL LET THE LITTLE BRAT
HANDLE IT.

263
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,791
- YUJI'S NOT COMING.
YUJI'S NOT COMING.

264
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,916
WHY NOT?
I JUST WANTED HIM TO BE--

265
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,916
WHAT'S THAT THING DOING?

266
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,666
- IT'S MINE, IT'S MINE!
- Alastor: IT'S OBVIOUSLY MAD.

267
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,958
IT'S LIKELY A RINNE
THAT HAS LOST ITS MASTER.

268
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,833
- IT HAS NO MASTER?

269
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,125
THEN THAT MEANS IT'S GONNA
DISAPPEAR IN A FEW DAYS.

270
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:58,083
- Alastor: HMM. NO MATTER
HOW MUCH EXISTENCE

271
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,291
A RINNE CONSUMES,

272
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,416
IT CANNOT USE
THE POWER ITSELF.

273
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,833
- SHUT UP, FLAME HAZE!
TOOL FOR DESTRUCTION,

274
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,458
YOU KILLED MY MASTER,
BUT I'M STILL HERE.

275
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,083
I WILL NOT DISAPPEAR!

276
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,583
- YOU'RE WRONG.
YOUR TIME'S ALMOST UP.

277
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,375
- OH, NO,
I AM GOING TO EXIST.

278
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,875
- AAH!

279
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,166
IT'S MINE, IT'S MINE!

280
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,250
- WHAT THE--
HE'S ALL FLAB.

281
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,583
HIS BODY'S SO SPONGY
IT'S HARD TO CUT.

282
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,833
- ( grunting )

283
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:42,583
STOP IT, YOU'RE CUTTING
AWAY MY EXISTENCE!

284
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,666
DON'T GO, DON'T GO!

285
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:51,041
- Chigusa: DO YOU HAVE PLANS
FOR TODAY?

286
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,333
- HMM?

287
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,958
- YOU'VE BEEN ACTING RESTLESS
ALL MORNING.

288
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,083
YOU KEEP LOOKING
OUT THE WINDOW.

289
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,833
- UH, I'M MEETING A FRIEND,

290
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,541
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
IF I DON'T GO.

291
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,041
- OH?

292
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,583
- IF I SHOW UP,
I WON'T BE ANY HELP ANYWAY.

293
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,583
- DID YOUR FRIEND SAY THAT?

294
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,041
OR IS THAT
WHAT YOU TOLD YOURSELF?

295
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,291
- OW, OW!

296
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,416
- EXISTENCE!
MUST GET POWER OF EXISTENCE.

297
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,250
- GIVE IT UP! YOU'RE GONNA
VANISH NO MATTER

298
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,958
HOW MUCH YOU EAT.

299
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:28,958
- NO, I WON'T! I REFUSE TO GO.
- DERANGED.

300
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,500
- Alastor: ALTHOUGH IT
HAS A LARGE BODY,

301
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,791
ITS CORE MUST BE QUITE TINY.

302
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,750
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO KEEP CUTTING

303
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,708
UNTIL WE DESTROY
THAT CENTER.

304
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,000
- MY EXISTENCE!

305
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:46,750
MUST EAT MORE POWER
OF EXISTENCE!

306
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,750
- I TOLD YOU IT'S POINTLESS!
- SHUT UP!

307
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:55,416
AAH!
- SHUT UP!

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,000
- DON'T ERASE ME!
DON'T CUT AWAY MY--

309
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,333
- SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!  SHUT UP!

310
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,875
- Yuji: EXCUSE ME.

311
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:08,000
- YOU KNOW, YU-CHAN,
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND,

312
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:12,750
PERHAPS THEY WANT YOU TO COME
BECAUSE THEY THINK YOU CAN HELP.

313
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,583
I THINK THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU CAN HELP A FRIEND OUT

314
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:18,708
JUST BY BEING THERE FOR THEM.

315
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:21,916
- THANKS, MOM.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

316
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,375
I THINK THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU CAN HELP A FRIEND OUT

317
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:40,958
JUST BY BEING THERE FOR THEM.

318
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,500
- SHANA CAN FIGHT
EVEN IF I'M NOT AROUND.

319
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,416
BECAUSE SHE'S SO STRONG.

320
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,125
SHANA?  SHAN--

321
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:10,250
- I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPEAR.
WHY?

322
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,750
- IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A RINNE.

323
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,500
- NO, DON'T DO IT!
I DON'T WANNA BE DESTROYED.

324
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:20,916
NO, STOP IT.
NO, DON'T DO IT.

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,666
DON'T DO IT!
- ( grunting )

326
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,416
- AAH!

327
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:32,083
I DID EXIST!

328
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,583
- SHANA.
SHANA, ARE YOU OKAY?

329
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:43,083
- I'M ALL RIGHT,
I'M NOT HURT.

330
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,791
I'M USED TO
THIS SORT OF THING.

331
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,375
I'M JUST A LITTLE TIRED.

332
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,625
- SHANA, I-- I'M SORRY.

333
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,083
- YUJI, WHY?

334
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:05,875
IT HURTS, YUJI.
