1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:37,041
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:39,916
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,583
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:45,166
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,958
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:49,750
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,625
Yuji: THE BATTLE WAS OVER.

9
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,875
IN THE AFTERMATH,
QUESTIONS REMAINED.

10
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,708
WHAT HAD THE DENIZEN,
KNOWN AS THE PROFESSOR,

11
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,750
REALLY BEEN TRYING
TO ACCOMPLISH?

12
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,250
AND THEN, THERE
WAS ANOTHER MATTER.

13
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,791
- Yoshida: SAKAI,
YOU'RE SO WARM.

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:39,708
NO, SAKAI, YOU'RE HUMAN.

15
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,625
- EVEN AFTER SHE
FOUND OUT WHAT I WAS,

16
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,500
YOSHIDA REVEALED HER
TRUE FEELINGS FOR ME.

17
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,708
AND THEN, THERE WAS SHANA.

18
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,666
- ( gasps )

19
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:56,458
- WHAT SEEMS TO BE
BOTHERING YOU?

20
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,666
- WIRHELMINA.

21
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,375
- IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING

22
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,708
IN THIS APARTMENT.

23
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,458
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

24
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,666
- Tiamat: CLEAN-UP REQUIRED.

25
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,583
- ( humming )

26
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,958
- UM, WIRHELMINA, HOW LONG
DO YOU INTEND TO STAY HERE?

27
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,666
- Tiamat: DURATION UNDETERMINED.

28
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,125
- Wirhelmina: UNTIL I'VE DONE
WHAT I CAME TO DO, INDEED.

29
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:14,291
- Alastor: WHICH IS?

30
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,333
- INDEED, THERE IS
A MYSTES IN THIS CITY,

31
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,291
AND IT CONTAINS
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

32
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,333
- ( gasps )

33
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:35,416
- Yuji: IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

34
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,958
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED, AND
ALL OF IT JUST LAST NIGHT.

35
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,375
- ( dog barks )

36
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,500
- HEY, YOSHIDA.

37
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,000
- HI THERE, SAKAI.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

38
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,250
- ABOUT YESTERDAY,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

39
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,416
WE GOT YOU INVOLVED
IN A BUNCH OF STUFF.

40
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,541
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE, SAKAI.

41
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,541
ACTUALLY, I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT.

42
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:22,208
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED, YOU
AND I GOT A LITTLE CLOSER.

43
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:26,833
IT HELPED ME TELL YOU
HOW I REALLY FEEL.

44
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:31,000
- UM, WELL THAT'S, THAT'S
NICE. THANK YOU, YOSHIDA.

45
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,750
- IT'S, IT'S ALRIGHT.
IT'S JUST THAT...

46
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,708
- Yuji: I'M GLAD YOSHIDA
TOLD ME HOW SHE FEELS.

47
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,791
I FEEL PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT.

48
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,708
BUT THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME ALIVE RIGHT NOW

49
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,833
IS THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,375
- SAKAI? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG?

51
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,958
- UH-UH. NOPE, NOTHIN'S WRONG.

52
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,041
- SO THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE
THE MYSTES WITH

53
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,958
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
CURRENTLY RESIDES?

54
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,208
- Tiamat: CONCEALED.

55
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:22,791
- YEAH. UH, WIRHELMINA,
WE SHOULD GO BACK.

56
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:26,708
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SOME
CLEANING TO DO,

57
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:29,875
AND BESIDES, I WANNA TALK
ABOUT SOME STUFF.

58
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,291
- THIS MORNING AND NOW THIS?

59
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,333
UNCHARACTERISTIC BEHAVIOR
FOR A FLAME HAZE, INDEED.

60
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,875
- Chigusa: AH, SHANA-CHAN!
- SHANA?

61
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,833
- SO, YOU'RE NOT SPENDING
TIME WITH YU-CHAN TODAY?

62
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,083
HE SAID HE WAS STEPPING
OUT FOR A MINUTE,

63
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:55,041
AND THEN HE JUST
RAN OFF SOMEWHERE.

64
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,208
- HE'S NOT HERE.

65
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,583
- AND WHO IS YOUR FRIEND HERE?
- WELL, THIS IS...

66
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,958
- MY, MY! SO YOU'RE THE MISS
CARMEL I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

67
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,583
I SHOULD HAVE INTRODUCED
MYSELF PROPERLY.

68
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:22,208
- IT DOESN'T MATTER. THANK YOU
FOR TAKING CARE OF HER.

69
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,625
- I'M GLAD WE COULD MEET.

70
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,791
SHANA-CHAN'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

71
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,125
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE THE
ONE WHO LOOKED AFTER HER

72
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,083
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG.

73
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,541
- ISN'T THAT
RIGHT, SHANA-CHAN?

74
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,375
- UH, YEAH.

75
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,500
- PLEASE, MADAME.

76
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,875
- MADAME SOUNDS SO
FORMAL, WHAT IS IT?

77
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,958
- YOU KEEP ADDRESSING
HER BY THAT NAME,

78
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,833
BUT I'D INDEED LIKE YOU
TO STOP CALLING HER THAT.

79
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:45,708
- WIRHELMINA!
- I SEE, PLEASE EXCUSE ME THEN.

80
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,291
MR. ALASTOR TOLD ME THAT SHE
PREFERRED TO BE CALLED THAT,

81
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,791
SO NATURALLY I ASSUMED
THAT YOU ALSO LIKED TO

82
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,791
CALL HER THAT, MS. CARMEL.

83
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,333
- THINGS ARE INDEED
STARTING TO BECOME CLEAR.

84
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,458
THE FLAMING-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER HAS BECOME

85
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:05,375
RUSTY BECAUSE OF THIS WOMAN.

86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,375
- SO, WHERE ARE YOU STAYING,
MS. CARMEL? AT YUKARI'S PLACE?

87
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,750
- YES, MADAME.

88
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,041
I PLAN ON TAKING UP
RESIDENCE IN YOUR CITY

89
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:17,750
FOR SOME TIME INDEED.

90
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,500
I HOPE YOU'LL UNDERSTAND IF
WHILE I'M HERE,

91
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,375
NATURALLY I WILL BE
TAKING CARE OF HER.

92
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:26,208
INDEED, I'M NOT LETTING THIS
WOMAN INFLUENCE HER ANY LONGER.

93
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,208
- WHY THAT'S WONDERFUL!

94
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,666
I'D LIKE TO THINK WE'VE BEEN
ABLE TO PROVIDE YUKARI

95
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,333
WITH SUPPORT AND COMFORT,

96
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,750
SO SHE WOULDN'T FEEL
SO LONELY ON HER OWN.

97
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,083
NEVERTHELESS, NOTHING CAN TAKE
THE PLACE OF FAMILY, NOW CAN IT?

98
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,208
THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

99
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,666
- FAMILY.
- FAMILY.

100
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:51,208
- EXCUSE ME, I'M NOT
RELATED TO HER BY BLOOD.

101
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,458
I MERELY HELPED RAISE HER,
NOTHING MORE INDEED.

102
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,458
- OH, YOU DON'T SAY.

103
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,500
YUKARI-CHAN, IS THAT
NOTHING TO YOU?

104
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,708
- MMM-MMM.

105
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:08,583
- WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE RELATED
BY BLOOD IS VERY A MINOR DETAIL

106
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,541
TO A FAMILY THAT LIVES TOGETHER.

107
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:16,958
- Wirhelmina: THIS WOMAN IS
INDEED DETESTABLE.

108
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,083
- BE CAREFUL.
- I KNOW.

109
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,958
- ( grunts )

110
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,666
- Tanaka: 35 CENTIMETRES!
A NEW RECORD!

111
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,750
- ( panting )

112
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,000
- OKAY. MY TURN.

113
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,833
- WE ARE GONNA LIFT THIS
THING, NO MATTER WHAT!

114
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,583
- YEAH, UNLESS
WE ACCOMPLISH THIS,

115
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:54,875
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ANY
HELP WHEN IT COUNTS.

116
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,041
- ( grunts )

117
00:09:57,166 --> 00:10:00,208
- Marco: THEY'RE REALLY
GOING FOR IT.

118
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,000
PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF ALL THE ATTENTION

119
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,708
THAT MYSTES BOY IS GETTING.

120
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,000
- IS THAT FROM HIM?

121
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,666
- YES.

122
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,583
BUT JUST AFTER KHAMSIN
GAVE IT TO ME,

123
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,083
HE SAID SOMETHING
THAT GAVE ME THE CREEPS.

124
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,791
- THAT REMINDS ME.
FOR HELPING WITH THE TUNING,

125
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,458
I HAVE AN AMULET FOR YOU.

126
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:54,208
- CAN I REALLY HAVE THIS?
- A TOKEN OF OUR APPRECIATION.

127
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,541
BY THE WAY, I MUST WARN
YOU TWO ABOUT SOMETHING.

128
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,250
WE'RE STILL NOT SURE
WHAT THE PROFESSOR WAS AFTER,

129
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,291
BUT WE HEAR THERE'S A LOT OF
SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OUT THERE

130
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,416
CONCERNING THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD.

131
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,541
- HMM? THE ONE INSIDE ME?

132
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,500
- Khamsin: IT WOULD BE WISE
TO EXERCISE CAUTION.

133
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,166
- MOVEMENT, HE SAID. RIGHT.

134
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,750
- SAKAI, YOU AND YUKARI HAVE
BEEN FIGHTING THIS BATTLE

135
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,166
BY YOURSELVES FOR A WHILE NOW.

136
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,583
- I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS.
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE.

137
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,541
THE VAST MAJORITY OF
PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIVES

138
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:36,083
WITHOUT KNOWING ANY OF THIS.

139
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
AND IF POSSIBLE, THEY'RE
BETTER OFF THAT WAY.

140
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,541
- Yoshida: SAKAI...

141
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,375
- Yuji: I'VE NEVER GIVEN IT
MUCH THOUGHT BEFORE,

142
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,000
BUT I REALLY LOVE THIS CITY.

143
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,916
IT'S THE PLACE WHERE
MY MOM, YOSHIDA,

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,500
AND ALL MY FRIENDS LIVE.

145
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:10,833
THEY'RE THE REASONS I
WANNA PROTECT IT SO DESPERATELY.

146
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,875
I NEVER WANT MY CITY, OR
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT,

147
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,791
TO GET INVOLVED IN THE KIND
OF MESS WE HAD YESTERDAY.

148
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,166
UM, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

149
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,083
- I'M SORRY, BUT
FOR A SECOND THERE,

150
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:37,375
I HAD THE FEELING YOU'RE ABOUT
TO GO VERY FAR AWAY SOON.

151
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,041
- WHAT IS THIS?

152
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,375
- IT'S FOR THE
TRADITIONAL BONFIRE.

153
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:52,291
- THAT'S RIGHT! THEY HAVE A
BIG FIRE EVERY YEAR.

154
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,416
I THOUGHT ALL THOSE ORNAMENTS

155
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,416
HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED
INTO RINNES.

156
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,666
HUH?

157
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,583
- SAKAI, IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG THERE?

158
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:10,291
- UH, SORRY.
IT'S NOTHING, LET'S GO.

159
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,583
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT,

160
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,833
BUT I SHOULD CHECK WITH
SHANA, JUST IN CASE.

161
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,833
FIND OUT IF THAT THING'S SAFE.

162
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,541
- I NEVER IMAGINED YOU'D BE
STAYING IN THE SAME HOUSE

163
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,666
WHERE THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD IS.

164
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,666
- Tiamat: UNFORSEEN.

165
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,916
- Wirhelmina: AND YOU WERE WITH
HER, FLAME OF THE HEAVENS.

166
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,500
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

167
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,541
- Alastor: Hmm.

168
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,958
- SO WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU
MEAN WHEN YOU SAY, "HMM?"

169
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:55,791
- Tiamat: DUTIES NEGLECTED.

170
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,333
- ( Alastor clears throat )

171
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:00,250
- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
TROUBLE WITH US STAYING HERE.

172
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,583
YUJI'S BEEN, WHAT I MEAN TO
SAY IS THE MYSTES HAS BEEN

173
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,208
HELPFUL IN OUR BATTLES.

174
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,416
- Alastor: ALTHOUGH
HE'S STILL INEXPERIENCED

175
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,541
AND LACKS
DETERMINATION AT TIMES.

176
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,166
- PLEASE TELL ME, WIRHELMINA,

177
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,916
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU PLANNING
ON DOING WITH THE MYSTES?

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,125
- I HEARD THAT THOUSAND
CHANGES WAS HERE.

179
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,875
- YES, SYDONAY.

180
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,875
- Alastor: YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THE BALL MASQUE.

181
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:27,291
- YES, INDEED, FOR IT IS
THEY WHO ARE MAKING

182
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,125
THREATENING MOVES AGAINST
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

183
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:32,375
- Yuji: I'M HOME!

184
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,625
- ( gasps )

185
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,583
- Yuji: MOM, SHANA'S
HERE, ISN'T SHE?

186
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,416
HEY, SHANA, THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

187
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
WHA...

188
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,416
- YU-CHAN, INTRODUCE
YOURSELF PLEASE.

189
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,916
THIS IS WIRHELMINA CARMEL, THE
PERSON WHO RAISED YUKARI-CHAN,

190
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,958
FROM WHEN SHE WAS JUST A CHILD.

191
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,708
- WHO RAISED HER?
- Yoshida: EKATERINA!

192
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,250
YOU CAN'T RUN
INTO PEOPLE'S YARDS!

193
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,708
- Wirhelmina: SO THIS IS INDEED
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

194
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,458
- ( Shana sobs )

195
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,083
- SHANA.
- SHANA-CHAN!

196
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,500
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
MADAME,

197
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,791
I'LL HANDLE THINGS
FROM THIS POINT ON.

198
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,041
- SURE.

199
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:45,416
- WE MUST SEVER ALL
SOURCES OF DISTRACTION.

200
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,500
- Tanaka: SO, OUR PERSONAL
BEST IS 48 CENTIMETRES.

201
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,750
- Sato: A LONG WAY TO GO
BEFORE WE CAN SWING IT AROUND.

202
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,666
BUT A DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT.

203
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,875
- LET'S GET SOMETHING TO EAT.
- YEAH.

204
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,416
BIG SISTER, WHAT WOULD
YOU LIKE FOR DINNER?

205
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
WE'RE THINKING WE'D LIKE
SOMETHING TO BOOST

206
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,500
OUR ENERGY LEVEL.

207
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,041
THAT'S STRANGE. IS
SHE SLEEPING AGAIN?

208
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
- Tanaka: MARGERY?

209
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,500
- Sato: MARGERY!

210
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,375
- Tanka: BIG SISTER!
- Sato: MARGERY?

211
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,458
- Tanka: BIG SISTER!
- Sato: MARGERY!

212
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,583
- HELLO? COME IN, BIG SISTER.

213
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:24,458
WOULD YOU AT LEAST
SAY SOMETHING?

214
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,291
- Tanka: BIG SISTER!
- Sato: TANAKA!

215
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,166
- Marco: ARE YOU LEAVING
THAT SWORD BEHIND?

216
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,333
- Margery: YEAH, BESIDES, IT
NEVER REALLY SUITED ME.

217
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:43,500
IT'S TOO UNSTABLE.

218
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,333
- Marco: YOU ARE SO RIGHT.
GIVING AN UNSTABLE WEAPON

219
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,500
TO SOMEONE AS UNSTABLE
AS YOU IS...

220
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,916
- ( Marco screams )

221
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
- SHUT UP, STUPID MARCO.

222
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,875
- Marco: THIS MAY BE A
SILLY QUESTION,

223
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,875
BUT ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

224
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,125
THE BALL MASQUE IS ON
THE MOVE, YOU KNOW.

225
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,166
- Margery: THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO
BE ONE STEP AHEAD OF THEM.

226
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,291
AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF, TOO.

227
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:08,500
- Marco: YEAH, I GUESS SO.

228
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,958
- WE STAYED HERE LONGER
THAN WE SHOULD HAVE.

229
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:13,416
- Marco: YEAH, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

230
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:19,250
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU, MISAKI CITY.

231
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:22,500
- Marco: AND GOOD LUCK TO OUR
BELOVED FOLLOWERS AS WELL.

232
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,166
- Tanaka: DOES THIS SEEM
RIGHT TO YOU?

233
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,166
- Sato: HOW COULD THEY LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING?

234
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,375
- IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

235
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,041
- ( grunts )

236
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,791
- Sato: HOW COULD YOU?

237
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,666
DAMMIT... DAMMIT... DAMMIT.

238
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,541
- Wirhelmina: SO THAT
WAS THE MYSTES WITH

239
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,083
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

240
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,250
WE MUST ACT UPON
THIS IMMEDIATELY.

241
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:06,625
INDEED WE MUST GO AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

242
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:10,000
- ACT UPON THIS?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

243
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,833
- Wirhelmina: BALL MASQUE
HAS ALWAYS DESIRED

244
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:12,958
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

245
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:16,291
AND NOW THOUSAND CHANGES
HAS FOUND IT.

246
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:17,958
THEREFORE, AS FLAME HAZES,

247
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:21,166
IT IS OUR DUTY TO THWART THEM
IN THEIR NEFARIOUS PLAN

248
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,708
WITH THE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE
METHOD AS POSSIBLE, INDEED.

249
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,541
IN OTHER WORDS,

250
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,125
WE MUST DESTROY
THE MYSTES AND TRANSFER

251
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,833
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION.

252
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,125
- Tiamat: RANDOM TRANSFER.

253
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:40,041
- WAIT! WIRHELMINA!
BUT THAT MEANS...

254
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,666
- INDEED, AS FLAME HAZES,

255
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,541
THIS IS THE ONLY STEP WE
CAN TAKE TO RESOLVE THIS.

256
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:04,625
- Yuji: I NEVER REALIZED
HOW BIG MISAKI CITY IS.

257
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:08,125
THAT'S MY HOUSE, AND THIS
IS WHERE THE SCHOOL IS,

258
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,750
AND THIS IS IKE'S HOUSE, HERE.

259
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,125
THIS IS THE SHOPPING DISTRICT
WHERE I FIRST MET SHANA.

260
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,125
AND HERE'S THE DEPARTMENT
STORE WHERE WE FOUGHT FRIAGNE.

261
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,333
THIS IS THE MUSEUM
WHERE WE BEAT MARGERY.

262
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,583
THIS IS MISAKI BRIDGE,
WHERE I FACED THAT DENIZEN.

263
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,500
AND THE RIVERBED
WHERE WE WERE LAST NIGHT.

264
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,791
ALL OVER THE CITY,
IN A SHORT TIME.

265
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,000
I'M LEAVING ALL THIS.

266
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,791
LEAVING TO HELP SHANA
FIGHT DENIZENS.

267
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:31,083
LEAVING SO THAT MISAKI
CITY DOESN'T BECOME INVOLVED

268
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,291
IN THE STRUGGLE.

269
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:39,458
I'M A MYSTES, AND THAT'S
THE ROAD I HAVE TO WALK

270
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,458
FROM NOW ON.

271
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,583
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SHANA?

272
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,791
- Wirhelmina: ON A STROLL
AT THIS LATE HOUR?

273
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,333
YOU'VE INDEED SAVED ME THE
TROUBLE OF DRAWING YOU OUT.

274
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
- UH...

275
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:10,250
- PREPARE YOURSELF, MYSTES
I MUST DESTROY YOU.

276
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,708
- ( gasps )

277
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,375
- ( screams )

278
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:18,875
- YOU WON'T SUFFER LONG.
- Tiamat: SINGLE SHOT KILL.

279
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:25,166
- Wirhelmina: INDEED, IT'S NO
USE CALLING FOR HELP.

280
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,500
THE FLAME-HAIRED BLAZING-EYED
HUNTER FULLY SUPPORTS

281
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,708
MY DECISION TO DESTROY YOU.

282
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,958
- ( gasps )

283
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:35,458
- SHANA? SHANA SUPPORTS THIS?

284
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:56,583
- I AM A FLAME HAZE. MY
MISSION IS TO PRESERVE

285
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,250
THE BALANCE OF THE WORLD.

286
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,750
( sobs ) I AM A FLAME HAZE,

287
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,958
THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED HUNTER.

288
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,041
- THIS IS THE END, INDEED.
- Tiamat: FINAL.

289
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,041
- ( theme song playing )

290
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,958
- ( singing in Japanese )

291
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:59,166
- Yuji: THE DUTY
OF A FLAME HAZE,

292
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,666
AND THE FEELINGS OF A GIRL.

293
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,666
SHANA FINDS HERSELF CONFLICTED
OVER YUJI,

294
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,041
WHO IS STILL SET ON
LEAVING THE CITY BEHIND.

295
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,833
NEXT EPISODE,
"DIVERGING FEELINGS."
