1
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,791
- Alastor: A HEARTBEAT
THAT LASTS FOR ETERNITY.

2
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:36,875
LIVES CONSUMED IN

3
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,958
SOUNDLESS BALLS OF FIRE.
NO ONE CAN TELL WHEN

4
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,500
THE WORLD IS DISPLACED,
AND THE FLAMES OF THE

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,000
CRIMSON WORLD SWEEP OVER ALL.

6
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:48,083
- ( theme song playing )

7
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,416
- ( singing in Japanese )

8
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,500
YOU'RE THE ONE I CAME TO SEE.

9
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,625
- I MUST DESTROY IT
BEFORE THEY GET IT.

10
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:30,625
- Yuji: SHANA!

11
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,000
- DID SHE JUST PROTECT
THE MYSTES? HOW RIDICULOUS.

12
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,541
- Yuji: SHANA, SHANA!

13
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,875
- YUJI. I DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

14
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,708
- Alastor: STILL NO MOVEMENT
FROM THE PALACE OF STARS.

15
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:34,250
DO NOT WORRY. SHE SHOULD
BE WAKING UP ANY MOMENT NOW.

16
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,708
AS FAR AS I CAN SEE,

17
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,791
THE GIRL HAS BEEN
STRUGGLING WITH EMOTIONS

18
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,208
WE COULD NOT HAVE
TAUGHT HER ABOUT

19
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,291
AT THE PALACE OF HEAVEN'S ROAD.

20
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,958
IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS EVER SINCE
SHE MET THAT MYSTES.

21
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,791
EMOTIONS THAT SHE
NEVER KNEW SHE HAD,

22
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,291
FEELINGS THAT SHE HAS
NO CONTROL OVER,

23
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,166
- Wirhelmina: HOW COULD
SHE FEEL FOR A MYSTES?

24
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,541
- Alastor:
THAT'S A SILLY QUESTION,

25
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:07,541
SPECIALIST OF EVERYTHING.

26
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,041
WE DID NOT TEACH HER THIS,

27
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,125
BUT BOTH OF US KNOW
WHAT HER MIND IS LIKE.

28
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:16,375
IT IS CLEAR THE GIRL DOES NOT
TRULY UNDERSTAND

29
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:17,791
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HER.

30
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,875
THEREFORE, SHE GETS IRRITATED.

31
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:28,250
- THAT'S INDEED UNDERSTANDABLE.

32
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,958
THAT BEING SAID, THE MISSION
OF A FLAME HAZE

33
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,125
MUST NOT BE UNDULY
INFLUENCED BY SUCH EMOTIONS.

34
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,458
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE
TAKING ON THE MANTLE

35
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,583
OF THE FLAMING-HAIRED
BLAZING-EYED ONE.

36
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,333
- Alastor: THE GIRL
UNDERSTANDS THAT.

37
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,791
AND THUS, THE CONFUSION.

38
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,250
- Sato: HERE YOU GO.

39
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,625
- YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT?
- I, I'M SORRY.

40
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,416
- DAMN IT ALL. WHAT DO YOU
THINK THOSE DENIZENS

41
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,416
HAVE PLANNED FOR SAKAI ANYWAY?

42
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,000
- I'M PRETTY SURE THEY WANT
THAT MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

43
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,375
THING INSIDE HIM.

44
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,833
- SO, DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE
GONNA HAVE TO KILL HIM

45
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,041
TO GET AT THAT DOOHICKEY?

46
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,583
- Yoshida: OH, NO.

47
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,916
- ( sobs )

48
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL SAVE HIM FIRST.

49
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,583
- WHA...
YOU MEAN US TWO?

50
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,583
- WHO ELSE IS GONNA DO IT?

51
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,708
THAT OTHER FLAME HAZE
AND EVEN HIRAI WERE TRYING

52
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,916
TO KILL HIM, REMEMBER?

53
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,083
- ( door closes )

54
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,083
- ( grunts )

55
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,208
- SO, WHAT'S THIS?

56
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,708
- BIG SISTER
LEFT A WEAPON BEHIND.

57
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,666
- ( grunts )

58
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,250
- Tanaka: SHE HELD IT
IN JUST ONE HAND,

59
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,500
BUT WE CAN'T EVEN LIFT
THE THING OFF THE GROUND.

60
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,458
- OH CRAP.

61
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,416
- Yoshida: IT'S JUST
TOO DIFFERENT.

62
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,875
- DIFFERENT? WHAT'S DIFFERENT?

63
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,458
- WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM
YUKARI AND THE OTHERS.

64
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,416
SAKAI'S LIKE THEM.

65
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,458
- ( sighs )

66
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,416
- RIGHT UP TO WHEN
SAKAI WAS TAKEN AWAY,

67
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,250
YUKARI FOUGHT
TO SAVE HIM.

68
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,958
ALL I COULD DO WAS WATCH.

69
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:49,166
- YOSHIDA.

70
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,083
- Tanaka: IF ONLY
BIG SISTER WAS HERE.

71
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,666
- Sato: TALKING ABOUT
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD.

72
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,541
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE NOW.

73
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:05,541
- SURE, BUT DO YOU REALLY
THINK WE CAN RESCUE HIM?

74
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,958
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT MAYBE
WE'RE JUST OVERREACTING 'CAUSE

75
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,041
BIG SISTER ABANDONED
US LIKE THAT.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,666
- Yoshida: ALL OF THIS, THIS IS
YUKARI AND SAKAI'S WORLD.

77
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,291
I CAN GET CLOSER,
BUT I CAN'T BE WITH HIM.

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,125
IT'S SO PAINFUL.
I CAN'T STAND THIS.

79
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,125
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP HIM.

80
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,833
OH, SAKAI.

81
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,875
- ( wind blowing )

82
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,666
- Sydonay: ARE YOU OKAY
WITH THIS, HECATE?

83
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,375
- Hecate: I DO NOT MIND,

84
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,250
IF THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD
WILL FULFILL MY DESIRES.

85
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,583
- Sydonay: HMM.

86
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,791
- Bel Peol: ARE YOU STILL
WORRYING FOR NO REASON,

87
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:14,208
THOUSAND CHANGES?

88
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,458
HECATE IS GONNA HELP US MEET
OUR NEED FOR POWER OF EXISTENCE,

89
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,958
'TIL THE END OF TIME.

90
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,708
- IT WORRIES ME WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT MEETING OUR NEEDS.

91
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:24,958
IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO
DO SOMETHING TO MY PURE HECATE,

92
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,666
AREN'T YOU?

93
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,000
- Bel Peol: NOTHING WILL CHANGE.

94
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,000
IN FACT, HER PURITY IS
A NECESSARY QUALITY

95
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,625
FOR THE WHOLE SACRED CHAPEL.

96
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,500
WELL, THEN,

97
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,583
THE PREPARATIONS FOR
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD

98
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,208
SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY NOW.

99
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,416
- WHERE AM I?

100
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:57,583
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

101
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,833
- HUH?
- YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE AWAKE.

102
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,916
- YUJI.

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,125
- ( moans )

104
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,750
- Alastor: CALM DOWN.

105
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,875
NOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE THEY
TOOK HIM TO THE PALACE OF STARS.

106
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,625
BALL MASQUE HAS A USE FOR
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD,

107
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,625
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING EXACTLY

108
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,458
I'M WORRIED OVER WHAT THE JUDGE
OF PARADOXES SAID TO ME.

109
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,250
- BEL PEOL'S WORDS?

110
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,500
- Alastor: HMM, THAT
THIS PLACE WILL BECOME

111
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,875
A FOUNT OF EXISTENCE.

112
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,791
- A FOUNT OF EXISTENCE.

113
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,208
- THE TREASURE'S DEFINING TRAIT

114
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,375
IS THAT IT MAKES POSSIBLE A
COMPLETE RECOVERY

115
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,916
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE.
THEREFORE...

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
- ARE THEY INDEED GOING
TO USE THE MYSTES

117
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,041
TO CARRY OUT THIS PLAN?

118
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,833
- VERY LIKELY, HOWEVER,

119
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:01,125
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD IS ONLY
ABLE TO RECOVER WHAT WAS LOST

120
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:03,125
DURING THE PRECEDING DAY.

121
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,333
GIVEN THE LIMITED SIZE OF
THE MYSTES IN QUESTION,

122
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,375
THAT DOESN'T AMOUNT
TO VERY MUCH AT ALL.

123
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,875
- Wirhelmina: THEN IT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO GO

124
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,875
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE.

125
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,875
- Alastor: HMM, ALL THE
MORE REASON TO THINK

126
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,541
THIS IS ONLY PART OF
A GREATER SCHEME.

127
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,375
- Wirhelmina: INDEED,
MIDNIGHT IS NOT FAR OFF.

128
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,083
- YUJI.

129
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,333
- WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

130
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,875
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

131
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,083
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE FORGOTTEN.

132
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,750
- BEGIN, HECATE.

133
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,416
- MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

134
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
- Bel Peol: HECATE, THE MIDNIGHT
LOST CHILD IS WHAT YOU DESIRE.

135
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,250
IT IS GOING TO FULFILL YOU.

136
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,333
MERELY TOUCH
YOUR BODIES TOGETHER.

137
00:12:57,416 --> 00:13:01,458
- Sydonay: TOUCH BODIES? UGH,
I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH.

138
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:05,041
WHY DOES MY HECATE HAVE TO
PHYSICALLY TOUCH THE MYSTES?

139
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,875
- BUT THAT'S THE
VERY ESSENCE OF HER POWER.

140
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,083
NO ONE ELSE CAN DO
WHAT SHE DOES.

141
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,083
- WHO ARE YOU?

142
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,958
- SUPREME THRONE, HECATE.

143
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,458
- HECATE.

144
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:26,416
- PLEASE OPEN YOUR BODY.
REVEAL YOURSELF.

145
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,083
- I'M EXPENDING.

146
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:45,041
- ( sighs )

147
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,125
- Yuji: WHAT'S HAPPENING?
IT FEELS GOOD.

148
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,333
- GOOD.

149
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,250
- ( bell tolling )

150
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:10,875
- I CAN FEEL IT. INFINITE
POWER, FULFILLING ME.

151
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:19,208
- Bel Peol: THE TREASURE
IS ABOUT TO GET BIG SURPRISE.

152
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,750
AFTER MERGING WITH
THE MYSTES,

153
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,500
HECATE WILL TAKE
IN VAST AMOUNTS.

154
00:14:22,583 --> 00:14:24,583
HER BODY KNOWS NO LIMITS.

155
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,583
- Sydonay: YOU TALK ABOUT HER
LIKE SHE'S SOME KIND OF MONSTER.

156
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:31,333
SHE'S A PURE EXISTENCE
WHO CAN NEVER BE FULFILLED.

157
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,333
SO SHE WILL NEVER BE TAINTED.

158
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,625
- ANYWAY, THAT IS WHY THE
MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD IS GOING TO

159
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:41,291
PRODUCE AN UNLIMITED
AMOUNT OF POWER OF EXISTENCE.

160
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,375
IN ADDITION, THE
SEEKER'S CONSTRUCT

161
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,833
WILL CONTINUOUSLY DRAIN

162
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,125
THE POWER AS IT IS
REPLENISHED BY THE TREASURE,

163
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,083
ENSURING THE BODY
WILL ALWAYS BE EMPTY.

164
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,458
THE MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD WILL
BE IN OPERATION PERPETUALLY.

165
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,708
THE POWER OF EXISTENCE
THAT HAS BEEN TAPPED

166
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,750
WILL BEGIN TO FLOW
FROM THE PALACE OF STARS,

167
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:07,291
AND THE NEEDS OF THE LAND
WILL BE SATISFIED.

168
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:15,000
- LIKE A FOUNTAIN
THAT FLOWS UNENDINGLY.

169
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,250
- Wirhelmina: No.

170
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:24,708
- IS THAT POWER OF EXISTENCE?
- THIS IS INDEED A GRAVE MATTER.

171
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,166
- Tiamat: MIDNIGHT LOST CHILD.

172
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,708
- LIKELY PRODUCED BY A DEVICE
CREATED BY THE SEEKER.

173
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,416
- Wirhelmina: THIS WILL
INDEED CAUSE A GREAT AMOUNT

174
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,541
OF POWER OF EXISTENCE

175
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,125
TO GATHER IN THE CITY.

176
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,500
THE BALANCE OF THE ENTIRE
WORLD IS IN JEOPARDY.

177
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,666
- Alastor: I DIDN'T EXPECT
THINGS TO PROGRESS THIS QUICKLY.

178
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,750
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO
GATHER OTHER HUNTERS

179
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,833
TO OUR SIDE.

180
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,625
- Wirhelmina: INDEED THE ONLY
ONES WHO CAN STOP THEM

181
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,583
ARE THE FEW OF US
WHO ARE HERE NOW.

182
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,666
- Tiamat: INTO THE ENEMY'S LAIR.

183
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,500
- DEALING WITH
THE MYSTES IS KEY.

184
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,208
DESTROYING IT WOULD INDEED BE
OUR BEST, MOST REALISTIC PLAN

185
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,916
TO DISRUPT THE OPERATION
THEY'VE PUT INTO MOTION HERE.

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,958
INDEED AS FLAME HAZES, WE CANNOT
AFFORD FAILURE AT THIS TIME.

187
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,666
BUT BEFORE THAT, WE HAVE
TO HEAL YOUR WOUNDS.

188
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,791
- YUJI.

189
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,041
- THEN WHAT ELSE AM
I SUPPOSED TO DO?

190
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,916
SHANA, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD.

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,375
I KNOW. I'M A MYSTES
AND YOU'RE ONLY A FLAME HAZE.

192
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:36,458
RIGHT? I BET YOU'RE GOING
TO DESTROY ME, AREN'T YOU?

193
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,000
- I WOULDN'T.
I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T.

194
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:42,041
BUT I COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

195
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,500
- Alastor: WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO WITH YUJI SAKAI?

196
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,833
- I DON'T...

197
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,750
- Alastor: OR RATHER,
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

198
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,833
- INDEED I BELIEVE YOU.

199
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,416
- Alastor: SHANA.

200
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,375
- IS THAT...

201
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,666
IT'S BLOODSUCKER.

202
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,500
WHAT IS IT DOING HERE?

203
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:13,041
- BIG SISTER, MARGERY,
LEFT IT BEHIND.

204
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,125
- YOU'RE GONNA GO FIGHT
THOSE DENIZENS, RIGHT?

205
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,791
WE BROUGHT IT
OVER HERE TO GIVE TO YOU.

206
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,375
- PLEASE, USE IT
TO RESCUE SAKAI.

207
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,083
- WE'RE BEGGING YOU.

208
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,333
WE WANTED TO SAVE HIM
OURSELVES, BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

209
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:28,000
- THIS IS THE ONLY THING WE
COULD COME UP WITH TO HELP HIM.

210
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,083
- HIRAI, YOU'VE GOTTA
SAVE HIS LIFE, PLEASE!

211
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:33,375
- WE'RE NOT ASKING
THE FLAME HAZE TO DO THIS.

212
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,875
WE'RE ASKING
YUKARI HIRAI TO SAVE HIM.

213
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,250
- HMM.

214
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,500
- PLEASE HIRAI.
- I BEG YOU.

215
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,291
- Sato: WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE CRYSTAL ALTAR.

216
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,791
- HUH?

217
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,791
- YEAH, MAYBE WE'LL BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU OUT FROM THERE.

218
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,916
- Alastor: ASKING
YUKARI HIRAI...

219
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,333
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE EVER

220
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,708
MADE THAT REQUEST.

221
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,375
- Yoshida: IT LOOKS LIKE
SATO AND TANAKA AND I

222
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,833
ALL HAD THE SAME THOUGHT.

223
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,000
- I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

224
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,125
- TRUTH IS, I DON'T
WANNA SAY IT.

225
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:36,458
- IF I WAS YOU, YUKARI,
I COULD GO RESCUE HIM.

226
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:39,291
I CAN'T STAND THIS.
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS,

227
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,708
YOU AND SAKAI ARE JUST
CLOSER TO EACH OTHER.

228
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,958
- WE'RE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER?

229
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,875
- BUT THAT GIVES ME
FAITH IN YOU.

230
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,041
SO, I BELIEVE IN YOU, YUKARI.

231
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:54,625
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE FEELING OF
LOVE IS THE SAME FOR EVERYONE.

232
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,791
I BELIEVE IN YOU, BECAUSE I
THINK YOU REALLY LOVE SAKAI.

233
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,500
- BECAUSE I...

234
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,041
- Wirhelmina: I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

235
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,291
- HUH?

236
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,083
- IF YOU DON'T GET SOME REST,

237
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,250
THEN YOUR INJURIES WILL INDEED
TAKE LONGER TO HEAL.

238
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,708
DESTROYING THE MYSTES IS A
MATTER OF THE GRAVEST URGENCY.

239
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,666
LET'S BE OFF.

240
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,500
- Yoshida: YUKARI,
I'LL BE WAITING.

241
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:27,291
COME BACK WITH SAKAI.
I'LL BE WAITING.

242
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,041
- RIGHT.

243
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:41,833
- OH, PLEASE. I'M SURE YOU'LL DO
IT, BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM.

244
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,041
- YUJI, I CAN FEEL YOU.

245
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:51,166
- Bel Peol: THIS ENTIRE
CITY WILL BECOME ONE

246
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,083
SOLID MASS OF EXISTENCE.

247
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,833
HAS THERE EVER BEEN ANYONE
WHO HAS GAINED SUCH POWER?

248
00:19:57,916 --> 00:20:02,666
NAY, I, JUDGE OF PARADOXES, WILL
BECOME THE FIRST TO CONTROL IT.

249
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,875
- Sydonay: HECATE.

250
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,416
- WHAT...AM I DOING?

251
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,250
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

252
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,291
I'M SURE I'VE
FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.

253
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,916
- THESE ARE...
THE MEMORIES OF THE MYSTES.

254
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,416
- MY MEMORIES?

255
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,708
- YES, YOUR MEMORIES
ARE FLOWING INTO ME.

256
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,750
- MY, THAT'S RIGHT.
THEY'RE MINE.

257
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:45,625
- SHANA, DECIDE FOR YOURSELF
WHAT PATH YOU WISH TO TAKE.

258
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,791
- YEAH.

259
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,041
- Yuji: I KNOW HER.

260
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,875
THAT'S...

261
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:55,958
- YUJI.

262
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,041
- SHANA!

263
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,625
- WELL THEN,
ARE YOU INDEED READY?

264
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:13,208
- YEAH.

265
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:16,916
- ONCE WE STORM IN THERE, THERE
WILL INDEED BE NO TURNING BACK.

266
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,916
- I KNOW.
- AND OUR OBJECTIVE?

267
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,583
- Shana: THE ONLY
THING I'M CERTAIN OF

268
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,583
IS THAT I HAVE TO GO IN THERE.

269
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:23,916
- I UNDERSTAND.

270
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,541
IF WE GO, I'M SURE THE ANSWER
WILL BECOME CLEAR,

271
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,000
- BECAUSE YOU ARE A FLAME HAZE.
- YEAH.

272
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,708
- Tiamat: ENTER.

273
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,875
- SHANA. SHE PROTECTED ME,

274
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,833
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOTHING
BUT A MYSTES.

275
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,583
WHY?

276
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,375
- ( sighs )
I'M BECOMING FULFILLED...

277
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,833
WITH A MYSTES...
WITH A PERSON.

278
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,250
THOUGHTS DEEP AND STRONG.

279
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:01,208
I'VE NEVER CONTACTED
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

280
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,458
- SHANA.
- Shana: YUJI, I CAN FEEL YOU.

281
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:09,541
- THEY'RE COMING.
- OH, YES. I'M READY FOR THEM.

282
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,666
BUT WILL THEY EVEN
MAKE IT THIS FAR?

283
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:25,000
- SAKAI, YUKARI.

284
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:32,458
- HIRAI.
- COME ON.

285
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,333
- WHY ARE THERE SO MANY
DENIZENS FROM BALL MASQUE

286
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,916
HANGING AROUND HERE?

287
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,708
DO YOU THINK THE PALACE OF STARS
KICKED 'EM OUT?

288
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,750
- Marco: THEY SAY THE RATS ARE
THE FIRST TO FLEE

289
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,125
A SINKING SHIP.

290
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,458
- Margery: HA, THAT THING'S
BASICALLY UNSINKABLE.

291
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:50,375
ESPECIALLY WITH
THAT HAG, BEL PEOL, IN CHARGE.

292
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:53,666
BUT, THERE IS SOMETHING
STRANGE GOING ON

293
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,791
- Marco: THESE GUYS MAY BE
ABLE TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

294
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:01,458
- ( chuckles ) THEN LET'S
START ASKING, SHALL WE?

295
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,375
FIRST, I'LL SOFTEN 'EM UP.
THAT'LL HELP 'EM START TALKING.

296
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,375
- ( theme song playing )

297
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:29,333
- ( singing in Japanese )

298
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
- Yuji: SHANA AND WIRHELMINA
ENTER THE PALACE OF STARS

299
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,791
WHERE THEY FALL INTO THE TRAP
BALL MASQUE SET FOR THEM.

300
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,333
THE FINAL BATTLE, FROM WHICH
THERE IS NO TURNING BACK,

301
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,125
IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.

302
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,000
NEXT EPISODE,
"BATTLE AT THE PALACE OF STARS."
