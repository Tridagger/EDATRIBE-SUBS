1
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:19,333
[MAKI] What? Mr. Kadota
went to Kanazawa?

2
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,625
[YOSHINO]
It's okay.

3
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,458
He apparently swore
that he'd be back in time!

4
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:24,875
Still, though, will he even
be able to find the guy?

5
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,041
Kanazawa's a pretty
big place, you know.

6
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,416
I'll contact Mayor
Naumann on social media

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,625
so he can keep
an eye out for him.

8
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,791
It would probably help if
he wore something distinctive.

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,708
[USHIMATSU]
What? Something distinctive?

10
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,791
[YOSHINO]
Right!

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:38,625
You've got to
put something on that

12
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,916
will be super easy to spot!

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,041
Easy to spot.

14
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,041
[USHIMATSU]
Naumann?

15
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,083
You? Naumann?

16
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,250
[MAN B]
Mon dieu!

17
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,791
Hello, excuse me, sir.

18
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,000
[OFFICER B]
Would you mind coming with us

19
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,666
for a little chat, please?

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,625
[USHIMATSU]
Wait, what are you doing?

21
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:04,750
Let me go! There's no time!

22
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,750
[SANAE] Not quite the
exposure we were looking for.

23
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,500
Man, it's no wonder
they took him in.

24
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:12,625
Chupakabura interrogation.

25
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,916
I've already told you,
I was waiting for someone!

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,083
How many times do I need
to say that to you people?

27
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,541
[NAUMANN]
Excuse me, I'm lost.

28
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:22,291
Do you know where
the Chupa-- Huh?

29
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:26,333
[USHIMATSU]
You, Naumann?

30
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:27,500
Yeah!

31
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:30,958
I can't believe I found you!
I found you!

32
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:31,958
Oh, you found him!

33
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:32,666
That's so great!

34
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,083
That's right!

35
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,416
The mighty, all-powerful
Chupa works in mysterious ways!

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,666
Sure, drive safely
on your way back!

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,666
Thank goodness!

38
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,958
Sounds like he'll
be back in time!

39
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:44,875
Do you guys know where Doku is?

40
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:48,291
The Hanging Toro lanterns in the
temple district won't turn on!

41
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,458
Doku was in the 5-DX when
I saw him a few minutes ago!

42
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,708
Hey, Mino, come take
over the 5-DX for Doku

43
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,208
[MINO]
What? Me?

44
00:01:56,291 --> 00:02:00,958
[MEN] Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

45
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,708
Well, Doku? Whaddya think?

46
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,458
[DOKU]
Oh, it'll be just fine.

47
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,458
All fixed. Try turning it on.

48
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:10,958
There!

49
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,791
Look at that, it does look good.

50
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,291
[NAGISA]
Guess who, Yoshino!

51
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,291
[DOKU]
Huh?

52
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:18,708
Nagisa? Mom? Dad?
What's going on?

53
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,750
Oh! Is this the queen's family?

54
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:23,000
Thanks for helping
look after my daughter.

55
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,958
Not at all,
she didn't need me for that.

56
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,666
You guys have fun, Queen.

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,291
[YOSHINO]
Thanks, Doku!

58
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:29,083
[NAGISA chuckles]

59
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,416
Were you shocked?

60
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,875
[YOSHINO]
I still am, actually!

61
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:33,958
I wish you all had told
me you were coming!

62
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,500
We thought it might be
more fun to surprise you.

63
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,833
[YAE] I'm so glad to
see you're doing well.

64
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,291
You really are the queen
of this town, aren't you?

65
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,125
That's right.

66
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,291
Around these parts,

67
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,083
I'm known as Her Majesty,
Queen Yoshino!

68
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,500
Have you already been
by to see Sakura Pond?

69
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,541
Yeah!

70
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,083
The cherry blossoms
were beautiful.

71
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:51,750
I think it was about
this time of year

72
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,125
when we first brought
her here, right, honey?

73
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,416
Oh, it was springtime?

74
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,166
That's so perfect!

75
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,708
[AMAMIYA]
A family reunion.

76
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,875
Honestly, a wonderful scene.

77
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:02,625
Do you mind if I film you folks?

78
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,958
Amamiya!

79
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,416
[AMAMIYA]
Now don't you to worry.

80
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,416
I'm not giving any
of it to Kume.

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,375
I've got some time to fill on
the evening news broadcast.

82
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,875
Honestly, I worked
pretty hard for it!

83
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,333
[MEN] Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

84
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:21,750
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

85
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you nervous at all, Ririko?

86
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,625
Yeah, a little.

87
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,166
When you're nervous,
you should write the character

88
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,416
for "person" on your palm
three times, and swallow them.

89
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,416
You do it like this.

90
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,708
Is that what you used to do,
back when you would sing?

91
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,958
[CHITOSE]
Yes.

92
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,208
That's how I know you're
going to be just fine.

93
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,208
You're my
granddaughter, after all.

94
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,750
Do you think he'll make it?

95
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,333
If Mr. Kadota's not here
soon, we're in trouble.

96
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,458
Has he been in contact?

97
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,458
He said that he's
heading here, now.

98
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,375
Hopefully, he's not
hitting any traffic.

99
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,791
[ringing]

100
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,541
[USHIMATSU]
Welp, we've got a problem!

101
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,958
[NAUMANN]
Oh! What a beautiful view!

102
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah...

103
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,416
What? You ran out of gas?

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,125
I'll go pick them up right now!

105
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
Okay great, can you go with her?

106
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,791
That way, maybe you can
do his makeup in the car.

107
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,625
I think Sanae's car is
parked out behind the tent.

108
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,916
There are too many roads
blocked off for the festival.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,375
You can't possibly
get the car out

110
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,708
from behind the pond right now!

111
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,416
My car is parked over
at the tourism center!

112
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,958
Why don't you you
guys just take that?

113
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,541
But how do we get
to the tourism center?

114
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,291
We'll have to run over there!

115
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:37,333
[MEN] Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

116
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,333
Excuse us!

117
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,625
How's it looking?
Will we make it?

118
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,375
Yep! No worries!

119
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,083
Huh?

120
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:45,625
Sanae told me what was up!

121
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go!

122
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,708
[USHIMATSU] Wait-o! You can
trust me. Ushimatsu! Okay?

123
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,041
Right, Ushimatsu.

124
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,125
Huh? Huh?! Is that them?

125
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,833
Hey! Right here! Over here!

126
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,458
Mr. Kadota is on his way here.

127
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,041
Don't worry, he'll make it
in plenty of time for the show.

128
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,291
[KAKIMURA]
All right!

129
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,625
Finally here, huh?

130
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,583
[MAKI]
Mm-hm.

131
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,083
Dad's coming to watch, you know.

132
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,416
Yeah, I know.

133
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,875
Tell him to try and film
the whole stage this time.

134
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,208
Oh, come on.

135
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,833
Let him film what he wants,
at least for today.

136
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,375
How're you, Erika? Nervous?

137
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,375
No, I'm not. Are you really...

138
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,083
[KOSUKE]
Hmm?

139
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,791
Are you really
planning to stay here

140
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,125
and be a taiko drummer?

141
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,166
I don't know what's
going to happen in the future.

142
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,375
I'm not sure if I can make a
living doing only that, y'know.

143
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:44,958
But... for right now,
I'm pretty set on it.

144
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,625
What about you?

145
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:51,416
[ERIKA] I don't claim to know
what's going to happen, either,

146
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,750
but I'm pretty set
on something, too.

147
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,666
What's that?

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,500
It's a secret.

149
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,833
Looks like he'll
get here pretty soon.

150
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:02,583
Okay. Yeah, I got it!

151
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,833
It's gonna be okay!

152
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:06,208
Kindaichi will be able
to lead them through!

153
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,958
A happi. Cool, I'm happy!

154
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,083
Okay.

155
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,166
Takamizawa,
make a right turn up here!

156
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,208
[NAUMANN]
Whoa! This is exciting!

157
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:21,833
Should we try to go
around the shrine float?

158
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,375
No, you've got
to walk from here!

159
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,166
Take the forest path
until you get to the palace!

160
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm the directions guy.

161
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,958
Paths between rice fields,
wild animals' trails.

162
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,083
I know every single
route in Manoyama!

163
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:36,125
There aren't really any
bears here, are there?

164
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,166
Nah, the sound of the festival
should keep 'em well away.

165
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,416
But if things get rough,
I'll protect you.

166
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,041
Where's Mayor Naumann?

167
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,000
What the?

168
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,625
Wasshoi! Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

169
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,625
Hey, wait, why are you here?

170
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,791
[NAUMANN]
Wasshoi! Wasshoi!

171
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,708
You like to wasshoi?

172
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,625
Yes! I wanna wasshoi!

173
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,750
I have idea! Everyone!

174
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,875
Sorry about this.

175
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,500
Do you mind if we
cut in here, though?

176
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,041
Thank you, thank you!

177
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,416
Wasshoi "rn"?

178
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,583
It's cool!

179
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,166
Sounds like he's
carrying the shrine float!

180
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,333
[SHIORI]
Apparently Mayor Naumann

181
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,000
is wasshoi-ing "right now"!

182
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,208
--Huh?
--Huh?

183
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:20,750
[DOKU]
There they are!

184
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,666
Well, it looks like you
made it this time, Beef.

185
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,500
[USHIMATSU]
Yes! I kept my promise.

186
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,291
Ha! And it only took
you 50 years to do it.

187
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,625
I brought Mayor
Naumann here with me.

188
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,583
If the sister city
thing goes through,

189
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,500
even if the absorption does
end up happening,

190
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:44,416
Manoyaman customs
and culture will still live on!

191
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,250
I made up my mind 50 years ago.

192
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,583
I'm not running away!

193
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,875
I'm going to
wake up this little town!

194
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:08,166
Okay, you guys,
it's finally time!

195
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,041
The shrine float has arrived.

196
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,791
So, let's get out there
and give 'em a great show!

197
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,416
Yeah!

198
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, Grandma.

199
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,791
If everything
goes well with my song.

200
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,041
I have something
important to ask you.

201
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,833
[CHITOSE]
Hmm?

202
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:45,791
I'm here.

203
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,708
I've finally arrived
at this place.

204
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:51,125
It's been a difficult journey.

205
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,333
I wonder if I can
get along here,

206
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,666
in this little village
full of humans.

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,541
I wonder, if we could
share our knowledge,

208
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,625
and live here
peaceably together.

209
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,708
Huh? Who on earth are you?

210
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,583
I've never seen you before!

211
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,708
What is it,
people of the village?

212
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,083
[SHIBUKAWA]
Oh, it's the Chief!

213
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,041
Amazing.

214
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,416
[MAKI]
I bear you no grudge.

215
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,250
You wanted to know me.

216
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,791
You actually wanted to join
hands and understand me.

217
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,208
And for that, I thank you.

[CROWD]
Cheers!

Whoa! I'm on TV!

243
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,500
[SHIBUKAWA]
Man, I got cut off!

244
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,458
Hang on, Maki,
play it one more time!

245
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,666
Sure, I'll put it
on slow-mo for ya.

246
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,125
The festival was a hit!

247
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,583
Your granddaughter got up
there and sang wonderfully,

248
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,541
so how about a song
from you, Olive?

249
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,666
Yeah, you could bring
the Garage Band back.

250
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,833
Oh, yes, I would
love to hear that!

251
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:47,083
You say that, but the reality
might be too much for you.

252
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,250
I couldn't believe it.

253
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,375
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Looks like spring has sprung

254
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,083
for Kindaichi over there.

255
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,291
I've always preferred
summer, myself.

256
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,958
A season of heat
for passionate lovers!

257
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,375
Let's have a matchmaking
tour during the summer!

258
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,583
Summer in Manoyama should be
more than hot enough for you!

My buddy!

264
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,791
I can't believe it, but we might
actually get a sister city!

265
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,000
You think the
sister city will happen?

266
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
It's certainly possible.

267
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,375
Cool, I've never
met a nun before.

[TAKAMIZAWA]
Hey there, Queen.

269
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,791
This year's really
been loads of fun.

270
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,625
Thanks to all your hard work.

271
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,416
Coming from the former prince,
that's an honor to hear.

272
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,958
We'll make it an even
bigger festival next year.

273
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,666
And I'll be one of the guys
carrying the shrine float!

274
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,000
Do it!

00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,083
[SANAE]
Phew! I might've drunk too much.

00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,833
Wait a sec, is
Riichan drunk, too?

277
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,291
You actually drank?

278
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,166
Yeah, my very first time.

279
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,750
It feels kind of good.

280
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,375
[YOSHINO sighs]

281
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,791
How beautiful.

282
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,500
Cherry blossoms and a starry sky
make good collaborators.

283
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,666
[SHIORI]
We had a meeting

284
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,666
under the cherry blossoms,
you remember?

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,750
[MAKI]
Yeah, it's been a whole year.

286
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,083
[RIRIKO]
It went by so fast.

287
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,500
[SANAE] We got to have some
silly adventures, though.

288
00:13:56,583 --> 00:14:00,000
[MAKI] It might've been silly,
but it was crazy fun.

289
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,916
I wish we could have some more.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,875
[YOSHINO]
Then you should!

291
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,791
Keep doing it! There's a saying.

292
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,291
"Show silliness,
recklessness, and filial piety

293
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,625
while you still can!"

Who said that?

the Kingdom of Chupakabura!

[SHIORI] Still, I guess this
is the end of this team, huh?

299
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,333
[YOSHINO] We've got the
abdication ceremony though.

300
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,916
[RIRIKO]
This is just the beginning.

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,291
[SANAE]
That's right.

302
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,250
Even if we're no longer
the queen and her ministers,

303
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,791
we still have our
whole future ahead of us.

[MAKI]
What'll you do, Sanae?

305
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,541
I'm going to open a
regional consulting office

00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,000
in the shopping district.

307
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,791

let me rent his store,

308

so I'm all set, now.

00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:40,916
What about you?

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,833
Have you thought about
what your next play is gonna be?

311
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,666
Uh-huh. This went so well

312
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,250
I want to do something based
on another Manoyaman folk tale.

313
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,250
There are a lot of them.

314
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,291
I could help you.

315
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:51,958
Oh, Riichan,
you could totally be

new playwright!

00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,166
Have you found something else
you want to do instead?

318
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,083
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hmm.

319
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,166
I made a promise
with my grandma.

320
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,458
I said if I successfully
sang on stage,

321
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:05,333
I wanted to leave Manoyama.

322
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,375
[gasps]

323
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,250
You're really leaving town?

324
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,333
I wanna see the world,
with my own eyes.

325
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,166
But don't worry, I'll be back.

326
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,916
You have to send
lots of pictures.

327
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,708
I will.

328
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,666
Actually, I've
made up my mind, too.

329
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,083
What I'm gonna do
right now, and the future.

330
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,125
You've decided
to leave us, then.

331
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,333
[YOSHINO]
Yeah.

332
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,875
I think Manoyama is
a really lovely place.

333
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:31,041
I've learned so much

334
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,916
from all of you guys
over the past year,

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,708
And I've felt at home here.

336
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,041
But, I... I don't feel
like it's time for me

337
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,500
to surrender to that
feeling, you know?

338
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,750
I think it's great.

339
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,208
You're making an
honest choice for yourself.

340
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,916
I can get behind that.

341
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,833
Yeah, so can we. Right?

342
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,916
Thanks so much, you guys.

343
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,791
Manoyama really is a
second hometown to me!

344
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,083
Well, I promise,

345
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,833
I'm going to do my
very best to look after it,

346
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,708
so it'll be all ready for you
whenever you want to come back!

347
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,416
Hey, let's all raise our
glasses, one more time!

348
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
[MAKI]
To bright futures for everyone!

349
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,083
[ALL]
Cheers!

350
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:30,166
Mr. Kadota.

351
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
[USHIMATSU]
Hey, you're up early, Queen.

352
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,708
[YOSHINO]
Yeah. Good morning.

353
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,333
[USHIMATSU] The last year
went by in a flash, huh?

354
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,041
[YOSHINO]
It did.

355
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,208
[USHIMATSU] I guess you've
made up your mind, then.

356
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,500
[YOSHINO]
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,750
[USHIMATSU]
No, no need to apologize.

358
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,708
It was a one-year contract.

359
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,791
It's better for you
to leave, anyhow.

360
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,333
If you stick around
here long enough,

361
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,208
then you won't be
an outsider anymore,

362
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,416
and that's no fun, right?

363
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,208
What are you planning to
do about the next queen?

364
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,500
Well, I've thought about it,

365
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,041
and I've finally come
to a decision on that.

366
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,541
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

367
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,250
Hey, come on,
it's about to start!

368
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,208
When I first came here
to the town of Manoyama,

369
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:20,000
I was totally unaware
of what it was.

370
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,208
I honestly assumed it was
just another country town

371
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,708
out in the sticks.

372
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,083
A "normal" little place
without much going for it.

373
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,750
But over the past year,

374
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,500
I've lived and worked
in Manoyama,

375
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,458
and I've met so many
different kinds of people here.

376
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,708
And before I knew it,

377
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:38,166
I realized that while
it might seem "normal,"

378
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,250
there are so many
things about Manoyama

379
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,625
that are completely unique.

380
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,458
Its own special history.

381
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,791
Its own special culture.

382
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,250
Its own special scenery.

383
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:50,583
These are things that Manoyama

384
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,083
has cultivated over a
long, long period of time.

385
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,875
Things that are truly precious,

386
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,375
that you'll never
find anywhere else.

387
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:01,708
Manoyama cherishes its
history and its culture,

388
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,916
and at the same time,

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,583
it's open and continues
to grow and change.

390
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,500
So, even if it was
only for a short time,

391
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:10,875
it has truly been this
foolish outsider's honor

392
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:12,333
to serve you.

393
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,541
Today marks the end of
my term as your queen,

394
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,500
so I'll say goodbye.

395
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,250
Thank you so much, everyone!

396
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:21,708
Thank you for making this
the best year of my life!

397
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,375
There is something that
Manoyama has cherished

398
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,500
for a very long time now:.

399
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,250
The ideal that was
clearly expressed

400
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,791
in the dragon song:

401
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,625
Do not reject other cultures.

402
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,583
Make their knowledge
a part of you.

403
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:43,041
Share and change with
the world, and you'll live on.

404
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:46,125
Some of us here had almost
forgotten about that ideal,

405
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,458
but this queen--this young,
foolish, outsider,

406
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,125
was able to
remind us who we are.

407
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,250
That's why I've made up my mind.

408
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,875
We don't need the Kingdom
of Chupakabura anymore!

409
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,625
Every individual person
in Manoyama can think

410
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,083
and learn, pass
down their culture,

411
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,750
and occasionally,
change and grow.

412
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,250
And we'll always be
proud of who we are,

413
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:08,833
and of Manoyama.

414
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,041
Effective immediately,

415
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,166
I hereby relieve the
queen of her duties,

416
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,250
and disband the
Kingdom of Chupakabura!

417
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,125
It truly was a wonderful year.

418
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,750
One for the books.

419
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,125
And for that,
Queen, I thank you.

420
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,583
Okay, Manoyama,
I think we should give it up

421
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:43,166
for the queen,
one more time, huh?

422
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,916
[SANAE]
Yoshino! Are you coming?

423
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,208
Yeah! On my way!

424
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,666
[MAKI]
Okay, that should do it.

425
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,916
[YOSHINO] This tree is
here for the five of us.

426
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,833
[SANAE] You think maybe
we should bury a time capsule

427
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,625
while we're at it?

428
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,708
You know what?

429
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,125
I want to keep planting
lots and lots

430
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,958
of cherry trees around here,

431
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:25,500
and Manoyama will
be known as a city

432
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,125
full of cherry blossoms!

433
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,541
I love that!

434
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,041
And so, then, no matter
if we're talking about ten years

435
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,500
down the road or a hundred,
Manoyama will always have them!

436
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,000
I hope that we'll
all be able to see

437
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:39,416
those blossoms
here together someday.

438
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,416
[YAMADA]
We're gonna miss you.

439
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,333
But don't worry,
the town's in good hands.

440
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,750
[MINO]
The Manoyama Tourism Board team

441
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,750
will always be in
our hearts, right?

442
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,416
Right!

443
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,000
Where is he?

444
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,833
Sorry, he said
he couldn't make it.

445
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:09,625
Oh. All right!

446
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,500
Thanks guys, time to go.

447
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:12,541
Take care, girl!

448
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,375
We'll schedule
a show in your area.

449
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,875
Good luck over there, Yoshi.

450
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,458
Come back for next year's
Mizuchi Festival, okay?

451
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,375
[YOSHINO]
Mm.

452
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,583
I wouldn't miss it!

453
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,375
[SHIORI, MAKI]
Yoshino!

454
00:21:37,458 --> 00:21:40,583
[MINO]
We love you, Queen! Be safe!

455
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,000
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

456
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:54,416
No way!

457
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,458
Bye, Kindaichi!

458
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,916
Doku! Bye, Chitose!

459
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,375
[laughs]

460
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:22,666
Huh?

461
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,125
Yoshino Koharu!

462
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:30,958
This is your town, forever!

463
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:34,500
You'll always have a home here!

464
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:41,208
You wrote my name wrong again!

465
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,875
[SANDAL]
And so, the queen departs,

466
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:51,208
having made the town
a little happier,

467
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,458
and becoming quite
happy herself in the process.

468
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,166
[SANDAL]
But, the townspeople's adventure

469
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,083
is only just beginning.

470
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:07,291
And the queen is beginning
a new adventure of her own.

471
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,500
Though, not where
she thought she would.

472
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,500
[SANDAL] You see, the queen
didn't decide to return

473
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,000
to Tokyo or go back
to the countryside.

474
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,083
She took another path.

475
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:22,166
[exhales]

476
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,791
Man, that was a close one.

477
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,166
Yoshino Koharu!

478
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,166
From the Momonga
Promotion Agency!

479
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,375
So nice to meet you!

480
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,625
[SANDAL]
All's well that ends well.

481
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,416
Thank you for
watching <i>Sakura Quest.</i>
