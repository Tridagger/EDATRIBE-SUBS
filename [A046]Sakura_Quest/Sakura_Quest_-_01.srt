00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,083
[CROWD clapping]

2
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,833
[YOSHINO] I think it's
a memory from my childhood.

3
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,875
I was in the main hall
of a palace somewhere.

4
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:54,208
Surrounded by my people
who were shouting my name.

5
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,458
And I wore a beautiful,
sparkling crown on my head.

6
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:02,291
[YOSHINO] In that moment,
I felt so happy.

7
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,041
It was perfect.

8
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,000
Was it some kind of dream?

9
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,958
Or did that day really happen?

10
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,750
I'm still not completely sure.

11
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,666
But it's my favorite memory!

12
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,375
[PROCTOR A] You're saying that
one memory has made you happier

13
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,583
than anything else in your life?

14
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:19,666
Uh, yes!

15
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,625
[YOSHINO]
Oh, crap! I screwed it up!

16
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,916
[PROCTOR A] I see you've applied
for our management track,

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,833
but are you open to accepting
a secretarial position?

18
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,625
Sure!

19
00:02:27,708 --> 00:02:28,875
Yes, I'm open to that.

20
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,666
I'd be proud to do my
part in any way I could.

21
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,416
[PROCTOR A]
Even at a rural branch?

22
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,083
Well, I'm not gonna lie.
I'd prefer Tokyo.

23
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,500
How many applications
have you submitted so far?

24
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,541
About thirty, counting this one.

25
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,541
[PROCTOR B] Considering that,
what's your theory

26
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,125
as to why none of
the others have offered you

27
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,416
a position yet?

28
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,083
Heh...

29
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,041
[FORTUNE TELLER 1A] Your human
strokes and total strokes

30
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,041
are unlucky, but the heaven
strokes are quite good.

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,833
Your golden years
will be blessed.

32
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,416
Look, I don't care
about my golden years!

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,791
I want to be blessed now!

00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,041
[sighs]

36
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,000
Anything wrong, Miss?

37
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:08,083
[YOSHINO] Yep. I've just been
"wished the best of luck" again.

38
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,208
It's like, I can't even seem
to nab a normal job

39
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,791
in the real world,
let alone be anyone's queen.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,375
[YAE] You can always come back
here if it doesn't work out.

41
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,083
Why don't you come home
and give your poor Mom

42
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,416
a hand?

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,291
You're saying I should
move home and help you out

44
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:24,541
with the chores?

45
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,208
You know the last thing
I want is to grow old

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,541
in the country.

47
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,458
[YAE] But you're okay with
growing old in the city?

48
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,666
[YOSHINO sighs]

49
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,916
[YAE] It's what normal
people do, you know.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,625
What's wrong with being normal?

51
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,500
Can you please not
call me "normal"?

52
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,041
I mean, I didn't say I was
completely out of options here.

53
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,458
I just had an interview today
and I haven't heard back yet.

54
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,916
[YAE] Why are you so
set on staying in Tokyo?

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,625
There's plenty of
work out here, too.

56
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,500
I don't like the countryside.

57
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,208
I'm not coming home, okay?

58
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:50,541
And that's that!

59
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:51,750
[YAE]
Fine.

60
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,708
But a graduate's gotta
go somewhere, right?

61
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,833
Remember, this is the
last month we're sending you

62
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:57,250
an allowance!

63
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,500
Ugh. What was I thinking,
having my fortune told

64
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:02,916
when I'm this broke?

00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,000
[squeals]

66
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,416
I wonder if mayonnaise
would be tasty

67
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,333
or truly disgusting on this?

68
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:24,166
[phone ringing]

69
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,125

Tell me, have I reached
Yoshino Koharu's cellphone?

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,750
You have.
This is her speaking.

Great, this is Hashimoto

74
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,875
with Momonga Promotion Agency.

75
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,958
I'm sorry. With which agency?

76
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,083
[HASHIMOTO] Momonga,
the model placement agency.

77
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,708
You registered
with us a while back

78
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,166
and we were able to place you
on a small project, remember?

79
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,041
Oh! Yeah, of course!

80
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,416
My friend and I
registered together

81
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,000
and you sent me on that job.

82
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,875
[HASHIMOTO] Well, we actually
had a client request you

83
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,375
by name, Ms. Koharu.

84
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,416
To be the spokesperson
for a rural town's

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,875
promo campaign.

86
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,916
They want you to be their queen.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,250
Be their queen?

88
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,541
Wait, you mean like
mayor-for-a-day type thing?

89
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,583
[HASHIMOTO chuckles]
The job is with a tourism board,

90
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,583
so it's probably something
along those lines.

91
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,916
There are obviously more
details in the contract.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,291
We'll send money to cover all
of your travel and expenses,

college this spring, right?

Have you already found a job?

Well, no. Good point.

There's nothing here.

00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,791
Hard to imagine
a tourist attraction.

101
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,791
Oh, hold on.

102
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,541
Could I have gotten
on the wrong train?

[gasps]

104
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,375

So sorry!

Um, 'scuse me,

106
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,583
but can you tell me,
is this the correct train

107
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,791
for Manoyama?

108
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,125
[MAKI]
Manoyama? Why go there?

109
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,625
For a job. I'm from Tokyo.

110
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,541
A job in Manoyama, huh?

111
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,541
[YOSHINO]
Yeah.

112
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,958

to be their queen.

Oh, the Chupakabura thing.

Hmm? What is this?

122
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:38,958
I'll slow down.

My name is Yoshino Koharu
and I'm here to take the job.

126
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,958
[SHIORI]
I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,291
There appears to have been
some kind of mix-up.

128
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,458
The person we were trying
to request for the position

129
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,416
is named Yoshino Tsubaki.

130
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,083
Yoshino Tsubaki?

131
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,333
Oh, she apparently
used to be a big pop star

132
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,333
back in the day.

133
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:04,000
Our board director
is a huge fan,

134
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,833
so he planned to have her
come promote our town

135
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,375
as queen.

136
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,000
[USHIMATSU] That person out
there is not my little Yoshino!

137
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,166
How in the hell did you
manage to screw this up?

138
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,083
Well, if you look at your note,
it really doesn't look

139
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,375
at all like Tsubaki.

140
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, it's my fault?!

141
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,791
Ah, here we are.

142
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,500
I finally found some info
on Yoshino Tsubaki.

143
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,375
I'm afraid she passed
away eight years ago.

144
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,666
[USHIMATSU]
Wha--?

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,916
Wow, so she was
famous forever ago.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,166
What should we do now?

147
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,166
We already mailed off
that long application

148
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,500
to receive a subsidy!

149
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,625
And we've already transferred
the contract fees

150
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,875
to her agency.

151
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,166
Which is all your fault
because you screwed up!

152
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,833
[YAMADA] Seriously,
would you look at your note?

153
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,625
Well the banner said "Tsubaki,"
so how do you explain that?

154
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,541
Funny thing--that was
actually a mistake

155
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:43,958
'cause we asked for Koharu.

156
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,916
[USHIMATSU] The characters
are too close for Koharu!

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,125
Shigaraki is only
a novice calligrapher.

158
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,083
Well, I'm a master!

159
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,500
[YOSHINO] Holy cow,
these people are nuts.

160
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,166
Mr. Kadota, please,
you've gotta calm down!

161
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,500
You're being very rude
to Ms. Koharu!

162
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,041
After all, she came here for us.

163
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Would you shut up, Shiori?

164
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,916
This random girl can't
possibly hold a candle

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,166
to my little Yoshino!

166
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,083
Your "little Yoshino"
would be an old woman

167
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,291
if she was alive!

168
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:08,791
Yeah, it's confusing
how you keep calling her

169
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,666
"little Yoshino."

170
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,583
What's confusing about Yoshino?

171
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,583
[YAMADA]
Everything!

172
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,125
[YOSHINO]
So, it's happened again.

173
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,041
Yet another job rejection.

174
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,083
She'll be my
"little Yoshino" till I die!

175
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:18,916
Pardon me!

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,958
[USHIMATSU]
Hm?

177
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,791
Um, the thing is,

178
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,666
we all know it's very easy
to mistake Tsubaki for Koharu

179
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,916
because of how they're written,

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,041
and no matter what level
calligrapher wrote it,

181
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,833
of course you would
see it as Tsubaki

182
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,666
if that's what you're
looking for from the start,

183
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,250
so that's no one's fault.

184
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:36,541
And no matter how old
your favorite pop star gets,

185
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,833
calling her "my little Yoshino"
is kind of sweet, isn't it?

186
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,083
Yeah, so, that's all okay.

187
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,166
Anyway...

188
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,333
I know I'm very young.

189
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,458
And I know I'm not
who you wanted.

190
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,166
And I'm sure Yoshino Tsubaki
was a wonderful person

191
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,916
and I couldn't hope to
compete with a pop star,

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,250
but if there is
something I could do

193
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,541
to help you all out here,

194
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,166
I'd love the
opportunity to try--

195
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,541
Fine, then!

196
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,250
I guess it's meant to be.

197
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,625
We'll go ahead
with the coronation,

198
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,958
as was originally planned.

199
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,000
[MINO]
Huh?

200
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,708
[SHIORI]
For the record...

201
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm really glad it worked
out for you to stay.

202
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,416
Oh, my name is Shiori Shinomiya!

203
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,416
I work for the
tourism board, also.

204
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,583
Nice to meetcha.

205
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,791
[YOSHINO]
Thanks, you too!

206
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,791
The one walking up
in the front up there?

207
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,541
That's Ushimatsu Kadota.
He's the king.

208
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,166
He's also head of the board.

209
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,000
And behind him is Shigaraki,
the bureau chief.

210
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,958
The really young one
is named Yamada.

211
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,625
And the one with
the glasses is Mino.

212
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:37,333
[YOSHINO] This place is almost
as dead as back home.

213
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,166
Excellent. Is this another
one of your idiotic plans,

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,583
you old jackass?

215
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,083
Shut up, you stupid hag.

216
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,333
[YOSHINO gasps]

217
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,666
Oh, no worries!
Those two are always like that.

218
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,875
[SHIORI]
This is Sakura Pond.

219
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,625
Soon the blossoms
will be in full bloom,

220
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,541
and I promise you,
it's absolutely beautiful!

221
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,208
Oh, and if you look that way,

222
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,750
you can see the,
um, palace, over there.

223
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,916
[YOSHINO]
The palace?

224
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,416
[YOSHINO]
The Kingdom of... Chupakabura.

225
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,666
[SHIORI] I know the kingdom
thing is pretty silly.

226
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,916
but they say years ago,

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,583
we used to get quite
a lot of tourists here

228
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,416
because of it!

229
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,541
A while back, these mini
independent states

230
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:46,208
were popping up
constantly all over Japan.

231
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,791
[YOSHINO]
Really? I never knew that.

232
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:49,916
It created interest in the town.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,583
We received tax money as part
of the Hometown Revival project.

234
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,333
Manoyama got caught
up in the boom,

235
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,291
and you're looking
at the result.

236
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,166
Then, the boom ended,
and so, here we are.

237
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,708
[music playing]

238
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,125
[USHIMATSU] Citizens of the
Kingdom, you must not forget!

239
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,458
You must never forget
the horror and calamity

240
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
visited upon us by
the Chupakabura!

241
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,833
Only the legendary
Sacred Sword could defeat it!

242
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,041
But, alas, the sword had
been sealed into stone,

243
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,291
and nobody had been
able to free it!

244
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,250
And that was when I,
Ushimatsu Kadota,

245
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,666
appeared on the scene
and though many had failed,

246
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,833
I miraculously freed the sword!

247
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,666
[SHIORI]
That's the basic backstory.

248
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,791
Oh, cool.

249
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,125
[USHIMATSU]
I stood resolutely against

250
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,125
the Chupakabura's attack,
cutting the beast down!

251
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,833
The Secret Sword
did not fail me! However...

252
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,875
Imagine him with a monster.
Probably soiled his pants!

253
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,833
[laughing]

254
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,166
[MINO]
Sorry, Mr. Kadota,

255
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,458
but if you could wrap this up...

256
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,958
[USHIMATSU growls]

257
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,041
Now, we shall conduct the
traditional coronation ceremony.

258
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,916
So, step forward, new queen.

259
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:54,625
Oh, right, here I am!

260
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,750
I lay this crown upon your head

261
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,333
as an acknowledgement
of your sovereign reign.

262
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:09,833
[grunts] And now, I hereby
declare you to be the new queen

263
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:12,041
of the Kingdom of Chupakabura!

264
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,083
[AUDIENCE clapping, chattering]

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,333
[GROUP laughing]

266
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:26,708
Well, you've sure had
a long day, haven't you?

267
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,291
You must be pretty worn out.

268
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, no, it wasn't
that bad, really.

269
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,250
Hey, Kinu!

270
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,375
What gives?

271
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,208
We're running out
of booze down here!

272
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,250
Oh, all right.

273
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
What's wrong, Queen? Drink up!

274
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,125
Here, gimme your glass!

275
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,833
Oh, thank you.

276
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,166
I know it's a bit late
for me to ask,

277
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,958
but what is a Chupakabura?

278
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,750
Well, it's a legendary
monster from around these parts.

279
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,166
They say it can suck
the blood out of livestock,

280
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,708
but I've heard that it's
actually just a weasel.

281
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:52,958
It is not.

282
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,333
When I was a kid,
I saw it with my own eyes.

283
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,208
Oh, God. You're not really gonna
start that nonsense again.

284
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,791
It's not nonsense!

285
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,708
Then where is the Chupakabura?

286
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,625
It's inside all of our hearts!

287
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:04,875
[laughing]

288
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,500
[TATSU] Say, that's
pretty tasty, isn't it?

289
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:09,083
Those potatoes
are a town specialty!

290
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,000
And we're known for
making other things, too!

291
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,375
But you should know
that the best thing

292
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,625
we've made by far
is the town itself!

293
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,625
The hope is you'll be able
to get the word out

294
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,250
about this great little place!

295
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,500
So, my queen.

296
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,583
I look forward
to working with you.

297
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,083
Wait. What do you mean?

298
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,083
How 'bout a toast?

299
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,458
Raise your glasses, get 'em up!

300
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,500
That's right!

301
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,333
To Manoyama and
its shining future!

302
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,333
Pitch black.

303
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,875
[SHIORI] I have to tell you,
I really am so glad

304
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,875
that you decided
to take the job, Yoshi.

305
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,583
Oh, sorry, is it okay
if I call you Yoshi?

306
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,375
Oh, um... mm-hmm.

307
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,250
Oh, good! And you can
just call me Shiori.

308
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,416
[giggles]

309
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,125
I hope you weren't
caught too off guard.

310
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,250
I know those old guys
can be pretty lively.

311
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,625
I'm used to it. I'm actually
from the country, too.

312
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, wow, this whole time
I thought you were from Tokyo!

313
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,625
The country wasn't for me.
I got out as soon as I could.

314
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,000
Why was that?

315
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:06,083
There's just nothing out there,
and it's so boring.

316
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,625
I didn't want to spend my
entire life out in the sticks

317
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:11,041
doing nothing at all.

318
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh! There's nothing
wrong with that, though!

319
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,208
No worries.

320
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,958
I mean, I totally hear
what you're saying,

321
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
but I really love my hometown.

322
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,666
That's why I want so badly
to be able to share it

323
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,291
with the rest of the world.

324
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,083
[SHIORI] Back in the day,
this little place

325
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,625
was used as a dorm.

326
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,500
Mr. Kadota said
to feel free to choose

327
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,458
whichever room you want.

328
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,083
Well, I guess that covers it,
at least for today.

329
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,166
[YOSHINO]
Thanks so much!

330
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,000
I've really appreciated
all your help.

331
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,333
Can't wait to kick things
off with you tomorrow!

332
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,166
What'd she mean,
"kick things off"?

333
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,458
--[rustling]
--[YOSHINO gasps]

334
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,583
[MAKI groans]

335
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,250
[YOSHINO gasps]

336
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,916
--[MAKI] Hm?
--[YOSHINO] Uh...

337
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:06,958
Wait a minute.

338
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,958
What are you doing
in this place?

339
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,958
Aren't you the new queen?

340
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,208
[YOSHINO]
What am I--?

341
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,833
They said I should
spend the night here, so--

342
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,000
anyway, why are you here?

343
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,166
Well, I'm the... guess I'm
the manager or something.

344
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,125
Of what, though?

345
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,166
So you're the talent, right?

346
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,041
What, like,
a model or something?

347
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,375
Or maybe you're a pin-up
girl that didn't sell?

348
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:29,500
That can't be it.

349
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,750
How rude!

350
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,583
I'm here because
I seriously needed the money.

351
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,583
So this is just
a one-time thing.

352
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,708
[MAKI] Oh, then,
you're just a normal student?

353
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,583
Could you please
not call me "normal"?

354
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,375
[MAKI]
So an abnormal student?

355
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:42,041
[YOSHINO]
What? No! I'm not!

356
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,125
Okay, so, you're normal.

357
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,125
Anyway, I'm kinda impressed
that you decided

358
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,291
to come to this
little podunk village.

359
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,666
It's not much more than
an old ghost town now.

360
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,000
Well, I'm going back
as soon as I get paid.

361
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,500
The event I was hired for
happened earlier today.

362
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,541
Wait, what are
you talking about?

363
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,750
You can't leave.
The job's just starting.

364
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,166
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

365
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
No way!
Did no one tell you?

366
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,500
Yoshino Koharu,
20 years old, from Tokyo,

367
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:12,166
was crowned the new queen
of the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

368
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,500
One hundred and fifty people
gathered together today

369
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,375
to celebrate her coronation.

370
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,791
The new queen will take up
residence here for one year,

371
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:20,375
and she'll be
participating in various

372
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,500
promotional projects for the--

373
00:16:22,583 --> 00:16:23,500
Wait a minute!

374
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,083
No one said it was a whole year!

375
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,416
[HASHIMOTO] Hello, Hashimoto
with Momonga Promotions.

376
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,416
Listen, I thought this
job was for one day!

377
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,000
Nobody ever said a word to me
about a year-long commitment!

378
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,791
What am I supposed to do now?

379
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,333
[HASHIMOTO]
Ah, Ms. Koharu!

380
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,833
I do believe those details
were in your contract.

381
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:39,000
My contract?

382
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,708
[YOSHINO]
Yep, there it is.

383
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,291
You have gotta be kidding me!

384
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,041
I can't stay for a year!

385
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,166
[HASHIMOTO] Well, it's a
little late to back out now.

386
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,875
I'm afraid we've already
signed the contract

387
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,000
with the tourism board.

388
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,375
Look, I don't care, okay?

389
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,708
How am I supposed
to live way out here

390
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:53,958
in the boonies?

391
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,291
[HASHIMOTO] But you'd
given up on finding work

392
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:56,625
before graduation.

393
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,541
I'm still waiting to hear
back from one company!

394
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,000
You had no right to
assume I'd given up already!

395
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,833
[HASHIMOTO]
Well, anyway,

396
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,166
just give it your best shot!

397
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,166
Talk soon!

398
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,666
--Wait! Don't go!
--[phone beeps]

399
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,166
You'd think a normal person
would read the contract.

400
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,708
I said I'm not normal.
So there you go.

401
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,375
But this place is nuts.
I'm outta here!

402
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,833
[YOSHINO]
Which way do I go?

403
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,875
Hey! You headed to the station?

404
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,041
[TAKAMIZAWA]
The bus depot.

405
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,750
You missed the last
bus to the station.

406
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,125
[YOSHINO]
No! Please, I'm begging you!

407
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,291
I've gotta get there!

408
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,625
Oh, come on,

409
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:40,333
do you really wanna be
the crazy lady on the bus?

410
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,333
[YOSHINO]
Sure, bring it on!

411
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,125
As long as it gets me to Tokyo!

412
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,541
[SANDAL]
Ask the bus and it'll hear you.

413
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:46,708
Or maybe not.

414
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,625
It doesn't actually
have ears, does it?

415
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,500
Nah.

416
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,666
But I do think it has a nose.

417
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,750
Can you imagine?

418
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,083
A big bus nose?

419
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,625
With, like, long nose
hairs sticking out of it?

420
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,916
Yeah, I gotta go.

421
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,541
[YOSHINO panting]

422
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,250
What? But it's only
ten o'clock at night!

423
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,833
[phone ringing]

424
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,916
Kinu! Bring it here!

425
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,458
Hey, Kadota!

426
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,041
The new queen just
said she was gonna

427
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,750
go back to Tokyo and ran
off towards the station.

428
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,833
Is everything cool?

429
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,750
She did what?

430
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,708
I'm not letting her out of this.

431
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,666
Shiori! You're coming with me!

432

Yoshi! Help me!

00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:11,375
No! Please save me!

[YOSHINO]
Shiori?

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
[SHIORI]
Go on!

441
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,291
You have to pull
the Sacred Sword free!

442
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,750
Yoshi, you can do it!
I believe in you!

443
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,208
If you defeat the Chupakabura
with the Sacred Sword,

444
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,416
then you will truly
become our new queen!

445

[CHUPAKABURA growls]

00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,208
[CHUPAKABURA growling]

447
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,958
Would you stop screwing around?

448
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:41,708
[USHIMATSU groaning]

449
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,833
[SHIORI]
Oh, Mr. Kadota!

450
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,875
[gasps]

451
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,875
I'm so sorry.

452
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,000
[KINU] Don't worry about it,
I know he's a handful.

453
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:58,208
It's because...
well really, it's because

454
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,041
we all love our town
as much as we do.

455
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,250
He's always saying
he wants nothing more

456
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,791
than to bring back
the life it once had.

457
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,375
[chuckles]

458
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,541
However, I'm not sure
he's going about it

459
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,916
the right way.

460
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,958
He thought if you
freed the sword

461
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,208
and experienced being a hero,

462
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:17,291
then you'd surely change
your mind about things

463
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,416
and stay here with us.

464
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,083
Don't feel like you
have to take the job

465
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:22,208
if you don't want to.

466
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,291
You're free to make
your own choices.

467
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,666
Why don't you go on
back to the dorm for now.

468
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,333
And then tomorrow you
can return home. 'Kay?

469
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:35,416
[SHIORI]
I wanna apologize.

470
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,958
That was so stupid of us.

471
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,041
I'm still really glad
you came here, Yoshi,

472
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,250
even if it was only for a day.

473
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,250
I always thought it'd
be fun to have someone

474
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,125
my same age as the queen.

475

liven up the town again,

00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:50,333
making it all it can be.

477
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,916
So that's why.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,083
I wanted you to stay so badly
I agreed to that silly prank.

479
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,375
I understand.

480
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,458
Thank you.

481
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,833
It selfishly makes me feel
good to have been wanted.

482
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:07,916
Thanks again.
Have a good night!

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,541
Okay, sleep well.

484
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,958
You've gotta be kidding!

485
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,333
Okay, then.

486
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,250
Guess I'll stay here
till morning.

487
00:21:58,458 --> 00:21:59,666
[YOSHINO]
Lotta history.

488
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,541
What is this?

489
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,541
No way, I've really
been here before?

490
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,083
This is the place where
that memory came from!

491
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,166
[SHIORI]
Yoshi, you stayed!

492
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,208
So does this mean that
you've changed your mind?

493
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,291
Wait, no, no, that's
not what's happening!

494
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,958
It's just that it was cold,

495
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,500
and I didn't have a blanket,

496
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:14,875
plus I'm still waiting to
hear back on one interview--

497
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,083
[phone chiming]

498
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,250
I take that back.

[crutch clanking]

500
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,708
So have you finally
made up your mind, then?

501
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,000
No, I have not!

502
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,208
[USHIMATSU]
If you're staying,

503
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,916
your first job
is waiting for you,

504
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,291
so let's hurry up
and get you to work.

wants to return to Tokyo.

506
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,166
But Tokyo is a little
too far away.

of the Five Champions."
