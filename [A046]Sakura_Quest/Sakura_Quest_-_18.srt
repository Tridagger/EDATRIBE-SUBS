1
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,041
[SENIORS]
Hey, hey, ho!

2
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:42,291
Hey, hey, ho!

3
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,500
[phone ringing]

4
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,083
Hey, Sanae.

5
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,041
[SANAE]
What the hell are you doing?

6
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,166
Being a hostage, basically.

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,541
A hostage?!

8
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,125
Please tell me they
haven't got you tied up

9
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,583
or anything.

10
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,708
[YOSHINO] No, it's not like
I'm here against my will.

11
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,625
[SANAE] Okay, whatever,
just get back here.

12
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,708
No way!

13
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,958
Come on, this is
the first time anyone

14
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,375
has really needed me!

15
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,375
I'm a hostage and
I'm gonna play the part!

16
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,791
--Are you nuts? Yoshino?
--[dial tone]

17
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,791
What's going on?

18
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,583
Well, I think we've been had.

19
00:02:09,666 --> 00:02:10,833
What?

20
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,375
This whole time,
the professor's been using us

21
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:13,583
for his own gain.

22
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,375
This is what he's
really been after.

23
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:18,291
An at-home coup d'état.

24
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,375
That's right.
He wants to use our livestream

25
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:23,166
to call attention to the
sad state of Warabiya.

26
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,166
I will now state our demands.

27
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,125
First, I want you to send
a real cameraman

28
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:28,791
to cover our protest here.

29
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,708
I would also like
three cases of beer

30
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,833
and some snacks.

31
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,750
And if possible,
a single malt whiskey,

32
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:34,833
which I'll pay for.

33
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,416
He's actually making demands.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,458
Giving them some beer
isn't that big a deal, right?

35
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,375
I'm not sure that's
the problem here.

36
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,708
Look.

37
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,041
We're getting some comments.

38
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,416
[SHIORI] Yoshi doesn't seem
to care about giving

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,750
a bad impression.

40
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,708
[MAKI] That was a pretty
mean thing to say, Shiori.

41
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:50,833
[YOSHINO] Hey, everyone,
the tea is ready!

42
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,958
She seems right
at home, doesn't she?

43
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,708
Anyhow, we've gotta do something

44
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,458
before it gets
negative attention.

45
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:00,416
Okay.

46
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:04,583
Oh, I think I've
forgotten my meds.

47
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,750
Well, go get 'em.

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,375
We're not in any big rush.

49
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,708
All right, we'll go
ahead to Shige's, then.

50
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,833
[MASA]
Okay.

51
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,875
We'll see you later,
right, fair Queen?

52
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,083
Roger that!

53
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,416
Nobody's gonna take
away our bus route!

54
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,791
[GORO]
I think that about does it!

55
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,958
[MICHIYO]
We really appreciate it, Queen.

56
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:25,125
This should hold
us over for a while!

57
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,791
You're a very hardworking
hostage, aren't you?

58
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,125
Not at all!

59
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,666
But hey, what exactly do
we do from this point on?

60
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,083
We're committing treason.

61
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,333
But we're not going to do
anything illegal, though.

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,333
Well, not for now, anyway.

63
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,666
[GROUP]
Cheers!

64
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:42,416
I'm sorry about earlier today.

65
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,875
Didn't mean what I said.

66
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:46,375
No, I was being childish.

67
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,916
I've got some good
fertilizer for you, buddy.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,416
C'mon, Queen,
have a little bit more!

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Thanks, yeah, I'll have more.

70
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,166
But Professor, are you
sure this is the best way?

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,333
[SUZUHARA chuckles]

72
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,291
Nobody would ever
pay any attention to us

73
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,291
if all we chose to do
was pout and whine

74
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,125
over our lot.

75
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,833
People are drawn to drama.

76
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,833
[HIDE] Seems like you're
always up to something, Masa.

77
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,916
[MASA] The girl with the glasses
is totally my type, though.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,958
[MAKI]
Excuse me!

79
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,416
Maki!

80
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,583
[MAKI] I come to you bearing
gifts of beer and snacks.

81
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,083
Everyone!
The beer and stuff is here!

82
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Was the store open?

83
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,458
Hey, listen.

84
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,333
Have you really
thought this through?

85
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,708
Sanae was pretty upset.

86
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,375
It's got nothing to do
with the tourism board though.

87
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:33,041
I'm staying up here completely
of my own free will.

88
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,500
I just really want
to stand with them

89
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,375
and help them out.

90
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,041
Cool. I get that.

91
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,208
[SHIGE]
Hey, it's the Oden Detective!

92
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:41,583
Oh! Yes it is.

93
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,958
No kidding! Come on in
and drink with us!

94
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,625
Sorry, I can't, I'm driving.

95
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:47,208
[YOSHINO] You could always
just spend the night.

96
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,666
Come on, how about it?

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,291
We just opened a bottle,
but of course,

98
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,416
it might be wasted on tanukis.

99
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,125
--[MAKI laughing]
--[GROUP chattering]

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,583
[SHIORI] It kinda looks like our
hunter has become the prey,

101
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:02,791
doesn't it?

102
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,041
[water sloshes]

103
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,000
Ah! This is perfect.

104
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,208
[KIYO] I'm leaving a change
of clothes here for you.

105
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,083
[YOSHINO]
Okay! Thank you so much!

106
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,000
[MASA yells]

107
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,958
[YOSHINO yells]

108
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,458
[YOSHINO]
Wh-What was that?

109
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,791
[MAKI]
It's okay, don't worry!

110
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:25,416
Just had to scare off a
disgusting ape, that's all.

111
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,416
[CHITOSE]
Ririko.

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,916
You're going to Warabiya
village, aren't you?

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes. I'm the cameraman.

114
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,916
[CHITOSE] I like that old
professor out there.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
He has guts.

116
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,416
You take him this gift from
the Board of Merchants, okay?

117
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,791
Good morning, everybody!

118
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:43,625
--[MINO] G'morning!
--[USHIMATSU] Hey.

119
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,291
Morning, Shiori!

120
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:46,958
So, how is our
fair queen today?

121
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,083
Yeah, seriously,
what is she doing, anyway?

122
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,375
I'm so sorry.

123
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,500
I know she's making
the Kingdom of Chupakabura

124
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,708
look really bad.

125
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,333
[USHIMATSU]
There's opportunity in crisis!

126
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,958
We'll just flip it,
and the queen's name

127
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:59,250
will be known across
the whole country!

128
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,125
Here you go!

129
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,416
Give this to the professor!

130
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,416
Last stop, ladies and gents.

131
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,208
Warabiya, Warabiya--

132
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,333
What in the hell?!

133
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,708
[SANAE]
The Republic of Warabiya?

134
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:19,875
Hey, you guys,

135
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:21,333
do you know what's
going on with all this?

136
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,916
Uh, kinda.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,791
[KANEDA]
Come on, now, Professor!

138
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,166
You know I can't have this.

139
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,625
Blocking the street?
It's not safe!

140
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,666
[SUZUHARA] Kindaichi,
you and I both know cars

141
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,875
hardly ever use it.

142
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,166
And we're not really
blocking anything.

143
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,000
[DOKU]
Oh, it's the delivery!

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,250
If the sensor detects
an approaching car,

145
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:49,541
it'll automatically
move us off to the side.

146
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,833
You're a pain in the ass!

147
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,750
We just want to
declare our withdrawal

148
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,541
from the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

149
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:55,958
Simple as that.

150
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,625
I don't think we're bothering
anyone out here, do you?

151
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,583
[KANEDA] You may
say that, but actually...

152
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,666
What is even
the point anymore?

153
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,916
Oh, I give up.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,291
Hi, everyone!

155
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,458
[SHIORI] A gift from the
outside, from Mr. Kadota.

156
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,291
[RIRIKO] I'm going to
be your cameraman.

157
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,208
Also, this is from the
Board of Merchants.

158
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,250
[YOSHINO]
Ooh, thank you!

159
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,416
All right,
I'm heading back for a bit.

160
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,208
Yoshino, are we good?

161
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,375
Yeah, of course!

162
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,666
Sorry about yesterday.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,708
I was actually about to
go mushroom gathering

164
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:28,833
with the ladies.

165
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,208
Any of you girls wanna come?

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,166
Totally!

167
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,875
It's my job, so...

168
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
I think I might...

169
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,041
[MAKI] Yeah.
Wanna head back together?

170
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,416
[SUZUHARA] Would you
like some tea, Mr. Kindaichi?

171
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,541
[KANEDA]
No, I can't, I'm on duty.

172
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,750
You're just as uptight
as ever, aren't ya?

173
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:48,333
Only pick the mushrooms
we showed you, okay?

174
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,333
Right!

175
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,583
There were a
whole bunch of them!

176
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,000
Wow, that's awesome, Yoshi!

177
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,000
[YOSHINO laughs]

178
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:54,791
[KIYO]
Oh, those are tsukiyotake.

179
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,125
If you eat one of those,
you'll turn ugly and die!

180
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,291
Wha--?

181
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,083
[YOSHINO]
But they look exactly the same!

182
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,333
I wonder how they
tell the difference.

183
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,958
[SUZUHARA] We can get
just about everything we need

184
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:08,625
from the internet now.

185
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:11,833
Withstanding a siege isn't
as hard as one might think.

186
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:14,750
[SANAE] But you know
you can't do it forever.

187
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,833
Professor, how long
are you planning

188
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,416
for this to continue?

189
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,333
What's your end game? What's the
goal you're working towards?

190
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666
I'm doing this to make
the people of Manoyama

191
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,333
aware of this problem.

192
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:28,666
And, look--our supporters
are increasing.

193
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,875
I guess.

194
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:31,541
Still, I just wonder
if you're actually going

195
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,791
to solve anything.

196
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,541
[SUZUHARA]
I can understand that.

197
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,916
But, this village will
disappear, eventually.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,916
I just wanted to
be able to document

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,625
a bit of their culture
before that happens.

200
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,083
Today I'm going to
show you folks

201
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,541
how to prepare Warabiya soba.

202
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:49,666
The most important
ingredient for this is water.

203
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,583
You can't make a good
soba without good water!

204
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,208
Always remember that, friends!

205
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,416
[GORO]
Look for yourself!

206
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,375
Aren't these the
most massive daikon

207
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,583
you've ever seen?

208
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,666
"Why are they so huge?"
you may ask!

209
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,916
Because we've
got the best manure!

210
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,583
[SUZUHARA]
You see? It's happening.

211
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:08,708
They're already beginning
to use the Internet

212
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,208
to pass them along.

213
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,166
The traces of their lives.

214
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,291
A digital archive?

215
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,666
Yes, exactly.

216
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Hey, what are you
guys doing with those?

217
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,416
[MASA]
We're making a snow barrier.

218
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,916
We build barriers
around our houses now,

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,666
before the snow piles up,
to protect our windows.

220
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,166
Oh, wow.

221
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,625
It must be hard if you have
to build one for each house.

222
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,875
It is.

223
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,666
But that's why they all
work together out here.

224
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,541
When you live in the snow,
everyone helps each other out!

225
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:39,541
This machine is amazing!

226
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,333
I feel like it's taken
about fifty years off!

227
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,666
I've made some improvements,

228
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,916
but do you recognize
a Hercules Mark 3?

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,416
[YOSHINO, SHIORI laugh]

230
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,458
Will this get me into
the big leagues, I wonder?

231
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,500
[yells]

232
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:55,875
[SUZUHARA]
Thanks to all of you,

233
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:59,125
the culture and customs
of Warabiya will spread.

234
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:02,541
They'll be passed on
rather than forgotten.

235
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,708
I'll rescind our
declaration of withdrawal

236
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,958
from Chupakabura
when the timing is right.

237
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,500
Don't worry about that.

238
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,333
It's hard to believe
this was actually your goal.

239
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,083
You're saying you knew
it wasn't going to happen

240
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,291
from the start?

241
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,875
No, guess I still have
some small amount

242
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,708
of hope for us.

243
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,958
Hope that one day Manoyama
might change for the better.

244
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,208
I'll ask you again,
and be honest.

245
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:29,000
Why did you choose
to come to Manoyama?

246
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,625
You made the
decision to move here

247
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,416
on your own.

248
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
So, now that you're here,

249
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,416
what's the next step
on your journey?

250
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,125
[SANAE] To tell you the truth,
I don't know yet.

251
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,916
[MICHIYO coughing]

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,083
You okay, Michiyo?

253
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,833
Oh, sure.
It happens all the time.

254
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,791
I'm sorry to put you
out like this.

255
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:52,875
You're not.

256
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,250
The hospital's just up
ahead of us now.

257
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,875
[MICHIYO] I can still handle
most things these days,

258
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,916
but driving is too much.

259
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,541
[TAKAMIZAWA] Hey. Last
bus is in five minutes.

260
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
You can wait inside for it,
if you want to.

261
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,833
Isn't there anything
we can do?

262
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,416
I mean, about the
bus route problem?

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,666
Believe me, I understand
that none of this is easy.

264
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,000
But there's a way.

265
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,083
I know for a fact that
we we can figure this out.

266
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,375
You know? Like if everyone
would work together,

267
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,416
I know we could
come up with something.

268
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,166
I'm afraid some things just are
the way they are, Queen.

269
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,666
[YOSHINO]
What about the professor?

270
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,041
He's over eighty years old,
and he hasn't given up yet.

271
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,125
[sighs] The old man's
just throwing a fit.

272
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:45,375
No, he's not!

273
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,583
He knew they had
run out of options!

274
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,791
Takamizawa, do you
love this town?

275
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,291
Do you really care?

276
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,166
What?

277
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,541
Are you okay with all of this?

278
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,333
You think everything's
fine the way it is?

279
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:56,791
No, of course I don't!

280
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:02,041
I spend my life sitting
right there in that seat,

281
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,125
watching this town
day after day.

282
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,833
For over fifteen years now.

283
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:09,416
One day, the florist
goes out of business.

284
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,166
The next, an empty house
is crushed by snow.

285
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,583
Then, the elementary
school shuts down.

286
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,458
You really think it's possible
for a person to feel nothing?

287
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,833
Watching their hometown
crumble around them?

288
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,416
I'm sorry.

289
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,083
That was really presumptuous of
me. I can see I was out of line.

290
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,375
It's time. You coming?

291
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,416
There's room for you.

292
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,666
[YOSHINO]
I'm heading back.

293
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,333
[TAKAMIZAWA]
So.

294
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,208
Now, all the older folks know
how to use the internet, huh?

295
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:52,958
[SANAE]
Huh?

296
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,333
Think you could help me?

297
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,875
As the minister of IT and all?

298
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,333
You know, it's so funny.

299
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,291
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about, too!

300
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,125
I guess it's okay to stray
from the route sometimes.

301
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,208
[MASA] Now this here is
a Hanging Toro lantern.

302
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,541
You'll find, every house
here in Warabiya has one.

303
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,541
Look it.

304
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,875
Ya see what I mean?

305
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,500
They're to make sure
nothing out of the ordinary

306
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,875
is happening at our
neighbors' houses.

307
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,500
If the lantern's not lit,
then it means something

308
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,166
might have happened, so we
should go check on them.

309
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,583
It's a simple way
to tell if someone's safe.

310
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:26,750
I see.

311
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,666
File it under
"special local knowledge."

312
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,625
[SUZUHARA] You can't
survive out here in the cold

313
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,416
unless you help each other out.

314
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,583
If you think about it,
it's just like shoveling snow!

315
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,750
Yes, looking out
for others is looking out

316
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,333
for yourself, isn't it?

317
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,583
You see, Queen,

318
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,541
I was interested in
the thought processes

319
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,416
and knowledge of people
living in snowy areas.

320
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,833
That's why I moved here.

321
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,375
But wait, what happened
to the person

322
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,041
that used to live here?

323
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,750
Oh, they moved
to a senior home

324
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,666
in the same town
where their son lives.

325
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,791
The professor was about
to retire around then,

326
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,583
so he bought up
the entire property.

327
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,041
So it worked out well.

328
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,666
Okay! I think it's time to eat!

329
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,791
[SHIORI]
We're back!

330
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,666
Sanae, I got
the list of districts

331
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,250
from the Board of Tourism!

332
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,166
So we pick out the
addresses from the districts

333
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,541
one at a time, right?

334
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,500
Just leave it to us.

335
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,875
[SANAE]
Thanks! I sure will!

336
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,833
[MASA]
Here, have another, Sandal!

337
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,041
Gosh, this food is delicious!

338
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,083
[YOSHINO] It's a persimmon
mushroom mayonnaise risotto

339
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,541
topped with fava beans!

340
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,791
And it was made
by the queen, herself!

341
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:33,541
I read food in snowy
areas tends to be high in salt.

342
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,125
Well, mayonnaise is
surprisingly very low in salt!

343
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,500
[MASA]
Hmm?

344
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,541
She's being so very
considerate because she knows

345
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,166
I have high blood pressure.

346
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,833
She's simply a wonderful queen!

347
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,208
[YOSHINO chuckles]

348
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,958
That's why you've got
to take down that old loony,

349
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,333
Ushimatsu, and then take over
the Board of Tourism yourself!

350
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,250
She returns to
betray her master.

351
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,583
Poor Ushimatsu.

352
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:55,125
I think he's really trying,
but if you ask me,

353
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,750
the problem is,
he's still a pup.

354
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,125
If you become the permanent
Queen of Chupakabura,

355
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,416
we'll all happily pledge
our loyalty to you.

356
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,125
Kind of reminds me of Snow White
and the Seven Dwarves!

357
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,833
Oh, goodness, you're right!

358
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,666
And we've even got
a prince, haven't we?

359
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,291
[GROUP laughing]

360
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:13,125
No, no, you've all got it wrong.

361
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,000
The true prince
will arrive on a bus!

362
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,375
[GROUP laughing]

363
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,250
[YOSHINO]
And down, up!

364
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,958
And back, and, up!

365
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,416
And down--

366
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,333
[HIDE] Hey, there's
something down below!

367
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,375
[GROUP]
Huh?

368
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:37,375
It's the Manoyama
On-Demand Bus!

369
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,583
Take a flier!

370
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,708
What an incredible idea.

371
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,916
Yeah, so, it won't
follow a regular route.

372
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,625
It only runs when
someone specifically

373
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,708
makes a reservation!

374
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,166
[TAKAMIZAWA]
It's a bit of a hybrid.

375
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,666
Something between
a bus and a taxi.

376
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,625
It's a little more
expensive than a bus,

377
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,750
but you can get a ride
whenever you want!

378
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,083
And on the business side,

379
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,750
it's a lot more efficient
than running a big bus

380
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,041
that nobody rides.

381
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,333
Wha--?

382
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,791
How has no one ever
thought of this till now?

383
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,208
[TAKAMIZAWA] I actually
did present the idea

384
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,458
to my company once before.

385
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,916
But then, red tape.

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,416
So it didn't go through.

387
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,625
I bet hiring someone
to take reservations

388
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,000
drove up the cost.

389
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,166
The solution
created new problems.

390
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,666
That's right.

391
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,875
But now that these seniors
know how to use the internet,

392
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,833
it's opened up lots
of other options.

393
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,250
Then you can
open up this page

394
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,166
just like I showed you,
and tap the word "reservation."

395
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,708
After that, all you need to do

396
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,833
is choose the best pickup time
and your preferred location!

397
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,208
[MICHIYO]
Oh, it's so easy!

398
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,708
As of now, it'll be
limited to Manoyama,

399
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,666
but we've already put in
all the different addresses,

400
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,125
like a car GPS.

401
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,333
Sanae put a lot of effort
into developing the program!

402
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,083
[YOSHINO]
She's amazing!

403
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,583
We're still in
the testing phase,

404
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,375
but I got permission
from my company,

405
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,750
so go ahead and hop on board!

406
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,791
All right! I wanna go first!

407
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,000
[MAKI]
Great work!

408
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,708
[GORO] Hang on, Masa,
I'm getting on, too!

409
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,333
Your carriage has
finally arrived, my queen.

410
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:58,625
Said like the
former prince you are!

411
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,041
Yes, former prince, indeed!

412
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,916
[YOSHINO laughs]

413
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,375
[KIYO]
I'd like to go to Sakura Pond!

414
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,958
It's been a while!

415
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,625
That was where my husband
and I had our last date.

416
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,333
All right!
Wanna take a boat ride?

417
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:13,125
Ha! Can you
paddle it, old man?

418
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,458
[HIDE]
Didn't you throw out your back?

419
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,708
The on-demand bus
goes door to door,

420
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,708
so no walking to the bus stop.

421
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,125
And it's carpool,
so it's cheaper than a taxi.

422
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,583
It's so perfect for Manoyama!

423
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,083
You know,

424
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,541
I'm kinda blown away by how
hard you've worked on this.

425
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,291
I'm impressed!

426
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:30,208
I take real pride in my work.

427
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,541
Without this job, I wouldn't
be able to feed my family.

428
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,083
Self-driving cars might
take over one day.

429
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,125
But I'm gonna go down kicking.

430
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,166
[YOSHINO chuckles]

431
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,291
They looked like they
were having so much fun!

432
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,958
Being packed in like
that stokes conversation.

433
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,958
So, do you think
you've done it, Professor?

434
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,000
Is that what you
were looking for?

435
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,208
If I'm perfectly honest,

436
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:52,500
I didn't think it would
go this well.

437
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,083
Ah!

438
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,666
I just realized, it's high time
I gave you your course credits.

439
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,791
Wait, was this
some kind of test?

440
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,250
Oh, in that case, you
better give us all As, mister.

441
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,375
Well, in my opinion,

442
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,791
a B grade will be
more appropriate.

443
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,333
You tough old bugger.

444
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,333
[SUZUHARA]
The Kingdom of Chupakabura

445
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,000
did not forsake its people.

446
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,250
We are proud to say that
the long-held spirit

447
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:17,958
of cooperation here
is alive and well today.

448
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,750
We're all very grateful.

449
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,708
I would also like to offer
my most sincere apologies

450
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,833
to those who were
inconvenienced in any way

451
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,166
by our declaration
of withdrawal.

452
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,750
We hereby rescind it.

453
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,958
And we're proud to be part of
the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

454
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:36,291
And now, a word
from our Queen.

455
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,000
Huh? I'm not ready.

456
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,333
C'mon, nothing fancy,
just a little speech.

457
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,500
[YOSHINO]
Um...

458
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm really sorry for all
the fuss and any trouble

459
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,916
that was caused.

460
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,166
However...

461
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,958
I have to admit, I love
this town even more now.

462
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:55,625
And thanks to everyone from
the Manoyama Bus Company!

463
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,541
Good girl.

464
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,000
She's so great at this.

465
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,291
Welp, I guess that
wraps it up, huh?

466
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,791
Hey, wait, what about
all the festival treasures?

467
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,375
We still haven't found them yet.

468
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,000
Almost forgot. Yeah.

469
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,750
There's a message
on the bulletin board.

470
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,125
[SANAE] It says,
"One of the festival treasures

471
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,416
lies in Sugita's storehouse."

Hello! This is the queen!

480
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,875
It was so sudden, huh?

481
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,041
I hope at least
he didn't suffer.

482
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,333
I just can't stand
the thought of that.

483
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,208
[KANEDA] He gave his will
to the notary ten years ago.

484
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,750
Left it all to the
municipal government.

485
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:35,250
I remember exactly what it says.
"I've prepared the funds to have

486
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,666
any and all
buildings demolished.

487
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,666
You can keep or reuse
them as you will.

488
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,583
As to what's inside, you can
do whatever you want

489
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:47,166
with all of that."
Very succinct.

490
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,583
He was a pretty cool guy.

491
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,916
He had a really nice smile.

492
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,375
That's an older photo.

493
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,750
I was able to blow it up.

494
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,083
[SHIORI] It still doesn't
feel real, does it?

495
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,125
[YOSHINO]
No.

496
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,291
[GORO]
Masa, I'm going to be honest.

497
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,666
I couldn't understand a
single bit of your eulogy!

498
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,750
[MASA]
It was dark.

499
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,500
I couldn't see the
paper properly.

500
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,541
What's this?

501
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,750
The professor's
research notebooks.

502
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,958
In the 20 years
since he arrived here,

503
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:23,166
he never skipped a single
day as far as I could tell.

504
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,875
He was doing research
the whole time he was here?

505
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,125
[SUZUHARA] The regions referred
to as "marginal villages"

506
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,958
do not simply fade
out of existence.

507
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,500
Through my current tests,

508
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,958
I have now found what I believe
to be a valuable case study.

509
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,083
[SANAE] So, this is what he
meant by "putting down roots."

510
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,750
[MASA]
Oh, that's right!

511
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:52,125
I suppose we need
to get a hold of Sugita.

512
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,250
Ah, of course.

513
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:54,833
Do you have his son's number?

514
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:55,875
Um, no.

515
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,583
Hold on, did you
just say Sugita?

516
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,041
[MASA]
Hm? Oh, yeah.

517
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:01,291
The guy that used
to own this place.

518
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,458
The message on
the bulletin board.

519
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,500
No way!

520
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
[YOSHINO] It's... It's one of
the festival treasures!

521
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,125
The Staff!

522
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,541
[RIRIKO] It even says
"Mizuchi Shrine" on it!

523
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,750
So that means it was
here all along, then.

524
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,958
He knew.

525
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,500
He knew it was here
and he didn't tell us.

526
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:23,541
[MASA laughs]
That's just like him!

527
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,625
Wait a minute.

528
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,666
Who wrote that message
on the board?

529
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,750
We checked so many places
and never found anything!

530
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,791
Maybe it was the professor.

531
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,583
[RIRIKO]
Signed, "Fawkes."

532
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,416
So he's a fox.

533
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Just like we're the tanukis.

534
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,083
Huh?!

535
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,625
Still not going easy on us.

536
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,208
Nope, he's not.

537
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,583
How the hell are we
gonna move this thing?

538
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,375
Hey, I know!

539
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,833
I love the new bus.
It's so convenient!

540
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,041
Hey, now.

541
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,750
Just promise me you
won't abuse it, okay?

542
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,750
It's still in the testing phase.

543
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:00,583
[YOSHINO]
Oh, you can be so uptight!

544
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,083
[TAKAMIZAWA] I know you are,
but what am I?

545
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,416
[laughs]

546
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,541
[SANAE] I don't have any
ties to Manoyama, either,

547
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,708
just like you
when you came here.

548
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:11,083
But connections are something
you make for yourself.

549
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,625
I don't know what
the future holds for me,

550
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,833
but I wanna see what
I can do here for now.

551
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:19,000
Thank you, Professor.

552
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:20,041
Thank you.

553
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,250
Hey, anyway...

554
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,333
Isn't this thing gonna bring
us bad luck or something?

555
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:27,791
No, no worries there,
Takamizawa!

556
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,000
Right!

557
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,458
We have good intentions,
that's what matters!

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,625
[SANDAL] Does the soul have
a place to which it returns?

559
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:45,291
Tonight, I shall contemplate
this question, whiskey in hand.

560
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,375
[SANDAL] Next time:
"The Foggy Folklore."
