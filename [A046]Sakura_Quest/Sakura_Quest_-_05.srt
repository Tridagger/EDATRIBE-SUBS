00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,666
[USHIMATSU]
Attention, everyone!

2
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,041
I've just come up
with a new form

3
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,958
of Manoyama Wood Carving!

4
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,791
Feast your eyes on this baby!

5
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,416
It's made out of dried bonito!

6
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,666
The first edible carving
in the industry!

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,625
It makes a perfect
table decoration,

8
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,375
and it's sure to cause
a stir in the world

9
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,750
of wood-carving!

10
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:56,625
Except that's not wood
carving--it's fish-carving.

11
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,875
[USHIMATSU]
Semantics! Who cares?

12
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:00,666
[SANAE]
I can't do this anymore.

13
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,750
I shouldn't be involved
if I have no purpose

14
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,625
and I'm not putting
my heart into it.

15
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,458
And yet you assume
you're qualified to talk

16
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,250
about Manoyama Wood Carving?

17
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,791
What a joke.

18
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,958
Hey! What's wrong, Queen?

19
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,291
Have you been listening
to anything I've said?

20
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,625
Please give me another
chance to do this!

21
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,708
[SHIORI] Yoshino said she
really wants to take her time

22
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,791
and learn some more about
Manoyama Wood Carving

23
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,250
before forging ahead.

24
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,291
So our meeting
today is canceled.

25
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,041
Not sure about this whole
"study on our own" thing though.

26
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,166
[YOSHINO] This one's
even cooler than the one

27
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,666
at Sanae's place.

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you know about when
this might've been carved?

29
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,916
Let's see, we had
the remodeling done

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,375
for our 25th anniversary,

31
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,125
so I guess it's been
about 20 years.

32
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,333
You don't have to tell
her everything she asks!

33
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,291
Oh, hey, Gen, you're there!

34
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,500
Listen, the queen wants to come
see your <i>ranma</i> , no photos.

35
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,250
She wants to inspect
it up close.

36
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,916
Also, if you know of
any other houses

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,166
that have <i>ranma</i> , we'd love...

38
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,541
[door opens]

39
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,833
[MAKI] We're all supposed
to study on our own today.

40
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,458
I'm gonna make lunch.
Want anything?

41
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,500
[SANAE]
No thanks.

42
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,708
I'm going out.

43
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,625
You're running away again,

44
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,500
just like you did
when you came here.

45
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,083
Leave me alone, would you?

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,458
[SHIORI sighs]
What'd I do?

47
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,416
I picked the most
boring book ever!

48
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,375
What a waste.

49
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,375
What are you studying,
Rii- <i>chan</i> ?

50
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,583
[RIRIKO]
Wood carvings around the world.

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,541
That one's actually
a little scary.

52
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,708
[RIRIKO]
That's why I like it.

53
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,958
[SHIORI laughs]

54
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,208
This takes me
back to high school.

55
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,041
Remember how we always
used to study together

56
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,500
for our big exams?

57
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,583
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,416
Don't you think you
should get ready now?

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,416
Probably, yeah.

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,708
Come on, man.

61
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:58,000
You can't skip this.

62
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,041
This is how I pay my respects.

63
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,875
[USHIMATSU]
I appreciate it, Gen.

64
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,000
[YOSHINO]
Thanks so much for your time!

65
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,833
How was that?
Was it helpful for you at all?

66
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,958
Sure!

67
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,166
Seeing a bunch of <i>ranma</i> up close

68
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,541
is a totally
different experience

69
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,750
from looking at pictures!

70
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,708
[USHIMATSU]
Hmm.

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,375
I suppose that makes sense.

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,541
All right!
On to the next one, then.

73
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,416
[MOTHER 5A]
C'mon, Hideo. Dinner's ready!

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
[HIDEO]
Okay, Mom!

75
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,750
[FATHER 5A]
That looks delicious!

76
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,083
[MOTHER 5A] Could you
hand me a plate, hon'?

77
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,125
[FATHER 5A]
Sure!

78
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:03,958
That you, Sanae?

79
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,750
Oh! Tatsuo.

80
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,500
I just came from a wake.

81
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,250
A customer passed who'd
been buying from us

82
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:13,041
since back when our
master ran the shop.

83
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,666
Mind if I join you for a sec?

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,333
No, not at all.

85
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,958
[TATSUO chuckles]
I recently discovered your blog.

86
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,500
What do ya call it,
"The Thrilling Adventures

87
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,458
of a Rural Web Designer"?

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:23,416
Is that right?

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,875
So you're saying you read it?

90
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,916
Uh... Should I not have?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,791
I don't know.

92
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,833
I mean, no, I don't really care.

93
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,791
[SANAE]
When I came here, this station

94
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,791
was my first official
introduction to Manoyama.

95
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,083
[TATSUO] Yeah, I guess it was
the same way for me, too.

96
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,958
[SANAE] I never wrote
about it on my blog,

97
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,041
but I used to come to
this bench and sit here

98
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,291
for hours on end when
I was feeling down

99
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,291
just to think things over.

100
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,208
I'd remind myself again of
the reasons I moved here.

101
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,375
How I needed a change
of pace and all that.

102
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,791
But work was still rough,
and I was pretty lonely.

103
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,750
But when I was at the station,

104
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,875
I'd sit here and look
down the track,

105
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:05,125
and I'd think about
how it leads to Tokyo,

106
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,375
and the world,

107
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,250
and it made me feel
less alone somehow.

108
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,083
Who would've thought

109
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,958
in this world of
online connections

110
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
that I'd be more comforted
by a train track?

111
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, no, I get it.

112
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,625
A train track represents
a physical connection.

113
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,125
The old fashioned
kind of connection

114
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:23,208
that we rarely get anymore
because we're all so

115
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:24,791
"plugged in."

116
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,375
Plus, I love all the stations
and how much history they have.

117
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,541
I just wish the trains would run
later, and more frequently.

118
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:32,500
Do you take trains very often?

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,583
I took one to the city for a
sculptor's guild meeting once.

120
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,000
Had a bit of a problem.

121
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,125
I was rushing to catch
the train home and I tripped,

122
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,541
and my shoes flew off.

123
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,708
But it was the last train,
so I jumped on, barefoot,

124
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,125
and left the shoes behind!

125
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,208
[chuckles]

126
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,500
Like Cinderella!

127
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,583
Yeah, I guess, if
Cinderella had hairy legs!

128
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,958
[SANAE chuckles]

129
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:57,375
Yoshino, I'm home.

130
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,416
Good! You're back!

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,875
Hey, do you want some of this?

132
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,166
It's just pizza toast
with some fried veggies.

133
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,916
Are you deliberately trying
to make me fat, or what?

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,166
Maki's in the bath right now,

135
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,041
but you can go next
if you want to.

136
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,166
Sure, thanks.

137
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,833
Okay, guys!

138
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,750
Today, we reconvene
to officially resume

139
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,500
our WCD Tourism Plan meetings!

140
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,458
Where's Sanae?

141
00:08:24,541 --> 00:08:25,875
Oh...

142
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,833
Sanae still isn't feeling
quite like her usual self,

143
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,083
so she'll be out for
a little while longer.

144
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,375
Anyhoo!

145
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:32,958
I think it'd be cool
for us all to share

146
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,458
what we learned from
our self-directed

147
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,625
Manoyama Wood Carving studies!

148
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:37,500
I'll go!

149
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,791
Great!

150
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,791
Well, I already knew
that Manoyama Wood Carving

151
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,083
flourished due to so
many <i>bushi</i> gathering

152
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,708
in Monzenmachi,
so I decided to go further

153
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,000
and research why they
started carving <i>ranma</i> .

154
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:50,000
No way, I looked
into that, too!

155
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,416
The Buddhist statue-shop-sign-
<i>ranma</i> thing?

156
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Right!

157
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,000
They started with
Buddhist statues,

158
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,750
then they began
creating shops signs

159
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:58,208
and when demand
for those died down,

160
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,666
they moved on to <i>ranma</i> .

161
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,958
They shifted with the trends,

162
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,375
and they were able
to survive as a result.

163
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,750
Interesting.

164
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:06,708
So maybe it's just that
traditional Japanese houses

165
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,125
are less popular than before,

166
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,916
which means that a new
era might be about to begin!

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,500
What it comes down
to is that we need

168
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,458
to try to anticipate
what the next era's

169
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,708
going to bring, right?

170
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:18,541
But while we're sitting
here thinking about it,

171
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,291
the number of people
considering becoming

172
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,833
a professional wood
carver is dropping fast.

173
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes!

174
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,875
But I think I've come up
with a great idea!

175
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,750
We should make a massive
wood-carved building!

176
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,708
We can remodel
the Chupakabura Palace,

177
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:32,291
and use a bunch of
wood carving to turn it

178
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,083
into an amazing palace!

179
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,625
All that studying
led you to this solution?

180
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,541
Yep, it did!

181
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,958
We'll be just like Sky Tree,

182
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,833
and Ushiku Daibutsu in
Ibaraki, and the Eiffel Tower!

183
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,125
If you build it,
they will come, am I right?

184
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,041
I wonder if it's
really that easy.

185
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,875
No, it won't be easy at all.

186
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,666
That's why we'll have
to really take our time

187
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,375
and do it the right way--
completing it piece by piece.

188
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:55,916
I'm talking about
doing it old school;

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,375
spending hundreds of years
on a legacy landmark...

190
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,541
...like the Sagrada Familia!

191
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,666
It's called Sakura Pond Familia!

192
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,041
If we can get
some news coverage,

193
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,958
people from all over
the world will be eager

194
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,750
to come contribute carvings!

195
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,333
Manoyama Wood Carving
techniques will be passed down,

196
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,041
our tourism will boom,
and we'll create new jobs!

197
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,041
It's kills three birds
with one stone!

198
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,875
Where do you suggest
we get the money?

199
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,583
Well, I mean, we could
charge for admission

200
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,083
and sell some souvenirs, right?

201
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,500
If it was easy
to draw tourists,

202
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:23,875
we wouldn't have this problem!

203
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,166
Anyhow, the reason
The Sakurada Familia's

204
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,833
a success is because
it was designed

205
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,750
by the great architect, Vivaldi!

206
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,291
Except it's Sagrada,
not Sakurada.

207
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,708
And it was Gaudi,
not Vivaldi, so--

208
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,208
Well, why don't we
get someone famous

209
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,458
to help us out, too?

210
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,166
Fine, then, go find us
a bargain-rate Vivaldi!

211
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,416
No worries, right?

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,250
[TV 5A]
But that's not all!

213
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,875
On top of the tree pruner,
if you act now

214
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,250
you'll also get a hand-held saw,
plus pruning shears...

215
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,583
[SANAE]
Ugh!

216
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:59,041
I have to stop!
This is where I was before!

217
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,791
I have to at least handle
my own business!

218
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,000
[doorbell chimes]

219
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,083
[SANAE]
Coming!

220
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,833
Is it a bad time?

221
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,333
[ANGELICA]
Thank you for waiting.

222
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,500
[SANAE]
Hm?

223
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,083
[TATSUO] Sorry to drop
in on you like that.

224
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,791
But I was just kind
of anxious to show you

225
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,208
what I've been working on.

226
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,250
Be honest. What do you think?

227
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,625
They're really
unique, aren't they?

228
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,208
Yeah, I hope so.

229
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,416
I was inspired to make them
after we talked about Cinderella

230
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,625
back at the train station!

231
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,583
Truth be told,
I don't know all that much

232
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,958
about women's shoes, though.

233
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,291
[chuckles]

234
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,333
So I was hoping maybe you
could help produce them?

235
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,291
Don't you think it
might upset Kazushi?

236
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't care if it does.

237
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,500
[TATSUO] The <i>ranma</i> that
Kazushi is working on right now

238
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,708
was originally a job
our master took on

239
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,833
before he died a year back.

240
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,666
Kazushi picked up
where he left off

241
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,625
and he's been trying
to complete it.

242
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,916
But that wake the other night,

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,541
it was for the customer
who ordered it,

244
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,833
so the now the
order is canceled.

245
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:10,750
But even so,
Kazushi keeps carving away.

246
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,291
He says he has to finish it.

247
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,208
That sounds about right.

248
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,000
He's just being stubborn.

249
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,208
Wood carving is our profession.

250
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,208
If you're not getting paid,
there's no point.

251
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:26,916
[music playing]

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,666
[YOSHINO] I guess this is all
easier said than done, huh?

253
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,875
[SHIORI]
C'mon, no worries, Yoshi!

254
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,708
Though, what Mr. Kadota
said was fair, actually.

255
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,041
Nobody is going to
invest in this as-is.

256
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,625
The quality of the
product doesn't matter

257
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,166
if the creator's unknown.

258
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,541
What matters is whether
or not they're famous.

259
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,208
Content's an afterthought.

260
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,291
That's how the world works.

261
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,333
Look, it's Sandal.

262
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,375
Huh?

263
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,541
[RIRIKO] Why don't we
ask Sandal for help?

264
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,000
Now that you mention it,
he might be great to talk to.

265
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,500
He's really well known
in this town.

266
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,541
But only as a super-freak.

267
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,750
Have you seen the paintings
on the walls at Angelica's?

268
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,291
Most people don't
know who he is,

269
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,958
but he's a star in some circles.

270
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,458
A vagabond artist.

271
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:10,000
His real name is Alexandre
Cena Davis Celibidache.

272
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,083
'Kinda name's that?

273
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,500
Why do you think
he lives in Manoyama?

274
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,791
[YOSHINO] I don't know,
but we have to talk to him!

275
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,833
He could end up being a really
important artist someday!

276
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:19,875
Uhh...

277
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:32,541
I hope Yoshi will be okay.

278
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,250
I'm more curious
about what Sandal did

279
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,166
to get in trouble
with the police.

280
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,916
'Cause he's really
a world-famous spy

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,250
wanted for questioning.

282
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,416
In a tumultuous fight
over classified documents

283
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,125
in the Kingdom of Chupakabura!

284
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,083
Hey, keep quiet about that!

285
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,333
[laughing]

286
00:13:47,416 --> 00:13:48,875
I'm gonna go get Sanae.

287
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,583
I think she might be out.

288
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,791
She wasn't in her room earlier.

289
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,916
I don't get it.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,250
It feels like she
might really be done

291
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,666
working with us.

292
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,083
Well, I don't know about that,

293
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,416
but why don't we just
let her be for now.

294
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,583
I know I've felt
that way before.

295
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,208
[YOSHINO]
I'm back!

296
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,291
I got Sandal to do
a drawing for us!

297
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,791
Oh, so he was released?

298
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,958
He wasn't arrested!

299
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,666
Turns out he
was just hitchhiking.

300
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,625
He seriously hitched
with the cops?

301
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,541
Yeah, then he wanted to
stay and have a cup of tea

302
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,875
at the station.

303
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,416
So he sketched it out
while we sipped on some!

304
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,916
Hurry up and show us.

305
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,166
[YOSHINO]
Are you ready for this?

306
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,166
Ta-da!

307
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,333
[SHIORI]
Wow.

308
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,250
[MAKI] People might
actually show up for that.

309
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,166
Right?

310
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,375
It's gonna work, for sure!

311
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,708
These are the members
of the Chamber of Commerce.

312
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,791
Let's start by looking for
some sponsors who live here!

313
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,958
Rii- <i>chan</i> , you'll be
in charge of direct mail.

314
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,041
All right.

315
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,208
I worked part-time
as a telemarketer.

316
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,375
Perfect!

317
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,916
In that case, you should
handle the phones.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,333
Shiori and I can
split up the duty

319
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:12,458
of making cold calls
to people's houses.

320
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,875
Good luck, all!

321
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,041
[YOSHINO]
Let's go, team!

322
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,083
[GROUP]
Go!

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,041
Oh, hey, Queen!

324
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:21,375
Where're you off to today?

325
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,083
I'm gonna make some cold calls!

326
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,958
Wow, you're really
embracing this.

327
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,250
You're not the same girl
who tried to run away.

328
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,250
Ah! Man, I did, didn't I?

329
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,541
Had you really forgotten?

330
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,166
Well, I suppose being a hot mess

331
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,375
is kinda part of
your charm, though.

332
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,416
A what?

333
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,416
Like you're one to talk,

Now Bus Driver.

335
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,333
Okay, well,
that came out wrong,

336
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,166
'cause I meant it
as a compliment.

337
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,666
Yep, if I were to be
completely honest with you,

338
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,916
this former prince could
learn from the queen.

Hey! Let me get you some tea.

342
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,750
Thanks, that'd be great!

[SANAE] You've been
working your butt off.

00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,416
Takamizawa said the
same thing this morning.

346
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,666
Thanks so much!

347
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,041
[gasps] Where'd those come from?
They're cute!

348
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,666
Tatsuo actually made them.

349
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,791
Did he, really?

350
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,291
Yeah, I guess that
is wood carving.

351
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,666
How cool that some people
use wood to carve shoes,

352
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,250
and others use it
to carve <i>ranma</i> .

353
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,708
I think I get it now.

354
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:32,958
Huh?

355
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:34,500
[YOSHINO] The thing you
said before about being

356
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,500
easily replaced.

357
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,541
I know what you were
trying to say now.

358
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:41,333
You think that plenty of people
could take your place here.

359
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,666
[YOSHINO] You know,
you're absolutely right.

360
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,583
I mean, for instance,
my job as queen

361
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,375
was supposed to be
filled by that actress,

362
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,458
Yoshino Tsubaki.

363
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,791
Remember all of that?

364
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,125
[SANAE laughs]

365
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,166
So you're saying even
the queen can be replaced.

366
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,250
Right.

367
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,208
I don't think there's
a job out there

368
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,500
that somebody else can't do.

369
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,541
Well, that's depressing.
Thank you for that.

370
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:03,041
No, it's not, though!

371
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:05,166
I'm sure the things I do as
queen are totally different

372
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,875
from what Yoshino Tsubaki
would have done

373
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,791
if she'd been here in my place.

374
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,625
But even if every job can
be done by someone else,

375
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,208
some results can
only be achieved

376
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,875
by certain people
because we're all unique.

377
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,666
I'm sure it was the same
with your job in Tokyo!

378
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,041
Maybe it seemed the
same no matter who did it.

379
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,291
But if you looked closer,

380
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,875
I'm sure you'd find
that there was at least

381
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,791
some small part of you
hidden in that work.

382
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,541
Who can say, really?

383
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:29,791
Over that whole time, though,

384
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,208
no one praised me for a
job well done, not once.

385
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,291
[YOSHINO]
That's okay!

386
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,083
Some people will
notice our hard work,

387
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,666
and some people never will.

388
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,333
Some people might
love what we've done,

389
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:39,625
and some might reject it because

390
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,375
they're coming
at it differently.

391
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,250
All of that is good because our
differences make us stronger,

392
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,458
and when we come together,

393
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,416
then we can create
something new.

394
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,916
Ugh! I'm not saying it right,
but I think we're all here

395
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,541
because our quirks
complement each other

396
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,958
and I believe we can
accomplish great things!

397
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,875
Thanks, Yoshi.

398
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,750
[phone ringing]

399
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,041
Oh, the owner of the
company I just talked to!

400
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,750
Hi, you've reached the queen!

401
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,625
Oh, no problem at all!

402
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,083
Yes, that'll work fine!

403
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,416
Thanks so much!

404
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Yes!

405
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,166
Sanae!

406
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,916
[SANAE]
This is an impressive proposal.

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,291
And an ambitiously
absurd concept.

408
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,333
I see Yoshino's work here.

409
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,625
But I think it might be really
tough to actually get it done.

410
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,291
That's why your Minister
of IT has come up

411
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,833
with a couple of practical
plans to try to push it through.

412
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:42,875
See?

413
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,333
First, there's the
money problem.

414
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,666
We'll continue
our current methods

415
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,375
of searching for sponsors,
plus add crowdfunding.

416
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,583
I've never heard
of "crowdfunding."

417
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,125
It's the latest way to raise
funds for certain projects

418
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,666
and it seems pretty
popular and effective.

419
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,833
Right.

420
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,500
You use the internet
to gather supporters

421
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,250
and invite them to contribute.

422
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,541
It's being utilized
all over the world.

423
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,916
We also need to consider
where to build it.

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,166
I know the current plan is
to build where the palace is

425
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,958
but I'd like to
propose another spot.

426
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,541
I think we should
use the train station.

427
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:16,875
Really? Why is that?

428
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,625
A station's a door to a city.

429
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,083
It's also already a landmark
for the people of Manoyama.

430
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,208
They greet and say goodbye
and stories are born there.

431
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:28,125
We can add color to those
stories with wood carvings.

432
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,041
And check it out.

433
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,291
You see?

434
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,958
He's drawn the station.

435
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,916
Doesn't it seem a little crazy
to suddenly rebuild the station?

436
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,333
True.

437
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,333
That's why, to start off,

438
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,500
we're going to cover the
waiting room with <i>ranma</i> .

439
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,000
And it's gonna be
just like the ceiling

440
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,791
of the Sistine Chapel.

441
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,500
[GROUP]
Oh.

442
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,000
[SANAE]
And I know exactly which piece

443
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:48,583
we should put up first.

444
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,583
[SANAE]
You were absolutely right.

445
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,833
You had me pegged.

446
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,791
I ran away from Tokyo
without thinking about

447
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,208
what it all meant.

448
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:00,958
But the place I ran to,
this town,

449
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,583
gave me the chance
to find that meaning

450
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,000
within myself.

451
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:06,500
[KAZUSHI] Did you come
over here just to tell me that?

452
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:09,708
No, but we came here to
discuss something with you.

453
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,166
Isn't it true that the person
who ordered that <i>ranma</i>

454
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,541
cancelled the order?

455
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you trying to say?

456
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,916
We actually have a proposal.

457
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,958
A way to ensure that
wood-carving remains here

458
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,833
for centuries without
compromising your ideals.

459
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,625
And a way for
Manoyama Wood Carving

460
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,625
to become known
throughout the whole world.

461
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:30,500
It'll also affect the
future carving pupils here.

462
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,250
You're carving from
a zelkova tree, right?

463
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,500
Judging by the <i>ranma</i> 's size,

464
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,125
I'd guess the tree was
150 to 200 years old!

465
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,333
We're asking.

466
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,041
Please help us keep
pursuing the meaning

467
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,416
that we've found here!

468
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,666
This is it! This is exactly
what I was looking for!

469
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,541
All right!

470
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,791
Well, I guess we're all done!

471
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,000
Nope, this is
just the beginning!

472
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,708
[SANAE] We'll spend the next
hundred years working on it,

473
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,541
but this is the first step.

474
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,708
Speaking of steps,

475
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,750
I'm looking forward
to working with you

476
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,750
on my wooden shoes.

477
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,083
Leave it to me!

478
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,125
I've been giving it whole
lot of thought lately,

479
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,291
and I wonder where else
can we take this idea.

480
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,208
The key is to infuse
everyday items

481
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,958
with Manoyama Wood Carving.

482
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,625
You know, Kazushi,
today's a big day for you,

483
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,041
and it really is okay
to smile about it.

484
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:33,166
Uh... Yeah. It's not bad.

485
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,375
Wow, that's my
first praise ever.

486
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,416
Huh?! What he said?

487
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,375
It was high praise from him.

488
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,708
We've really done it!

489
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,500
We've taken the first step
for Sakura Pond Familia.

490
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,291
Kinda makes you wish
we could live long enough

491
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,583
to see it finished.

492
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,833
I get that.

493
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,625
It is kinda sad.

494
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,416
But our kids and
grandkids will love it!

495
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,458
Yeah.

496
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,291
--Oh!
--Ahh!

497
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:04,458
--[WOMAN 5B] How lovely!
--[WOMAN 5C] Well, look at that!

498
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,750
[SANDAL]
Hello!

499
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm the walking Sandal!

500
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,541
And my hobby is gardening.

501
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,958
Next time:
"The Rural Masquerade."
