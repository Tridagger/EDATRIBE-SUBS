00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,208
[USHIMATSU growling]

2
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,333
[USHIMATSU]
What do you think?

3
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,875
Not bad for being made
20 years ago, huh?

4
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,291
Uh, yeah...

5
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,166
It's a sci-fi film set in the
Kingdom of Chupakabura.

6
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,583
Yeah, I created it.

7
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,625
Pitched it to some
production companies.

8
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,625
[MAKI]
Uh-oh, it cut off.

9
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:08,375
They apparently ran
out of funding part way

10
00:02:08,458 --> 00:02:10,708
through filming,
so that's as far as they got.

11
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,041
I think that might've been
a blessing in disguise.

12
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,250
I know, right?

13
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,833
[USHIMATSU]
What's that supposed to mean?

14
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,166
[YOSHINO] The scripts for the
movie just got here, you guys!

15
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,291
[SHIORI] This time it'll be run
by an actual production company!

16
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,250
And the cool thing is,
they approached us

17
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,875
about shooting in Manoyama!

18
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,416
Why wouldn't they?

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,916
What time is the
film crew getting here?

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,541
It can't be long now.

21
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,458
A slice-of-life story
set in Manoyama.

22
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,500
This is such great P.R.!

23
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,208
I bet it'll bring in
more tourists!

24
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,500
Yes! There it is!

25
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,833
They've got my name in there.

26
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,791
Will you actually
appear in the movie?

27
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,291
[USHIMATSU] They didn't
have enough actors.

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,708
What can you do?

29
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,333
So you used your position
to force your way in, huh?

30
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,500
[SANAE]
If that's the case,

31
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,291
maybe you could score
a role with lines,

32
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,250
Little Miss Oden.

33
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,708
Little Miss what, now?

34
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,666
I don't act anymore.

35
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,625
The lead is Taiga Hayama,

36
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,500
and the heroine is Moe Sawano.

37
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,291
I've never heard of her before,

38
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,458
but I've seen Taiga Hayama in
lots of dramas and commercials.

39
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,875
This'll be my first
time to meet a real actor!

40
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:08,125
Oh, yeah,
chief handywoman.

41
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,583
Yo, Maki!

42
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,875
[MAKI]
Hm?

43
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,000
[USHIMATSU] Heard they're
short on stagehands.

44
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,250
You could do that, right?

45
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,666
Huh?

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,458
They're saying people with
past production experience

47
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,625
would be real handy.

48
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:18,666
[MAKI]
Well, you can forget it.

49
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Wha--?

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,916
What was that?

51
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,791
[FUJIWARA]
You must be Ms. Shinomiya.

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,875
Thanks for setting up
housing for us.

53
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,250
My pleasure.

54
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,291
My name's Fujiwara.
I'm the 3rd assistant director.

55
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,000
The director got tied up
with something,

56
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,833
so he'll be here
a little later on.

57
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:40,416
Oh. I'm sorry.

58
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,583
I don't have a card
to give to you.

59
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:46,083
I'm Yoshino Koharu, Queen of the
Kingdom of Chupakabura.

60
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,000
It's great to meet you.

61
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,125
Ah!

62
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,000
One of those tourism
ambassadors, huh?

63
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,166
Basically, yeah!

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,458
Cool, we've got
a queen on our side!

65
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,083
I'm sure that'll come in handy!

66
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,416
Uh, good!

67
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,166
You should be in that movie,
Oden Detective.

68
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,208
No, I shouldn't.

69
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,458
Oh, okay.

70
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:07,208
Maybe I'll go
try to grab a role.

71
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, that'd make it
a whole different genre

72
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,708
for sure.

73
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,833
[TAKAMIZAWA] Hey, where
are the two of you going?

74
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,291
[ERIKA]
Taiko practice.

75
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,500
Kill me now.

76
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:18,750
So why not take a role
as an extra instead?

77
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,958
Your big film debut!

78
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,500
I don't work for free.

79
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,000
O... kay.

80
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,083
[door opens]

81
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,291
[BOYO]
Hey, Kosuke!

82
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:27,416
Well, hey there!

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,750
Practice, huh?

84
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,375
I'm right behind you--
be there in a bit.

85
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:31,541
Practice hard!

86
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,166
Uh, yeah.

87
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,041
I'll try to do that.

88
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,125
Huh...

89
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,416
[TAKAMIZAWA]
"Average luck"? Really?

90
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,250
[KOSUKE] Can I get a
melon au lait, please?

91
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,833
[GROUP snoring]

92
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,875
[YOSHINO] So what exactly
do you need us to do for you?

93
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,583
Ah, let's see here.

94
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,375
To start, we'll need to
negotiate for the location,

95
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,583
talk to the residents,

96
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,458
apply for a road use
permit with the police,

97
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,416
secure some extras,
set up catering.

98
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,041
[YOSHINO]
Wha--?

99
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,708
The assistant director's
in charge of all that stuff?

100
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,125
Yeah, and I'm only third in line

101
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,958
behind the chief
and first assistant.

102
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,333
Plus, we have to
share the workload

103
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,458
because we have a
super small budget.

104
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,208
Wow, that must
be pretty rough.

105
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,666
[FUJIWARA]
Kinda.

106
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,041
There are definitely things
I won't be able to get to,

107
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:15,666
so we're really going
to need as much help

108
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,041
as you can give us!

109
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,166
No worries, friend.

110
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,125
Between all of us,
we can handle it.

111
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,291
Thanks, I hope so.

112
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,541
[KOSUKE] How long are you
planning on staying over there?

113
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,208
Dunno. It's pretty comfortable.

114
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,541
[KOSUKE]
Don't be so stubborn.

115
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,833
Just come home.

116
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,500
[MAKI]
I'm sure he's still pissed off.

117
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:31,583
You mean Dad?

118
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,250
What, about you
dropping out of college?

119
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,375
[MAKI]
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,625
I didn't wanna go
in the first place.

121
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,291
I wanted to go to art school.

122
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,666
Yeah.

123
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,791
He did have predictably
strong feelings about that.

124
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,208
You think?

125
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,291
[KOSUKE] Probably just
a little hurt that you didn't

126
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,708
consult with him
before you quit.

127
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,541
Old man's got a lot
of pride, you know.

128
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,458
Wait, whose side
are you on, anyway?

129
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,583
Come on, apologize
and get it over with.

130
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:54,375
Huh? What am I supposed
to apologize for?

131
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,166
I'm not gonna pretend
I was the wrong one.

132
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,208
Damnit, Maki.

133
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,291
And what about you,
brother of mine?

134
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,791
This is your last year.

135
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,458
Are you planning on leaving
town when I go back?

136
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:05,333
Hey, don't worry about me.

137
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:06,666
I like this town a lot.

138
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,916
You know how I do.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,750
Drummin' my way through it all.

140
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,916
[MAKI] That's exactly
what I am worried about.

141
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,833
What I'm thinking is they could
come down this way on the bikes,

142
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,125
like so.

143
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,333
It'd be a better composition
if we could shoot

144
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,750
from the other side, though.

145
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,875
What do you think?

146
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,500
Where would we set up
the base camp?

147
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,333
[YOSHINO]
Sanae! Check it out!

148
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,500
[SANAE screams]

149
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,083
Stop that! How old are you?

150
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,541
--[YOSHINO laughs]
--Yoshi, let's go,

151
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,458
we should get to
work now, anyway.

152
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,458
[YOSHINO]
Aww! Hi!

153
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,375
Whatcha doin' there,
little buddy?

154
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,875
[CAT meows]

155
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,000
[SANAE] It's pretty empty,
but it's got great atmosphere.

156
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,833
These streets have been
here since the Edo period!

157
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:54,208
[ASST DIRECTOR]
Even a water mill!

158
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,416
What a score!

159
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,333
Yes, this particular
mill is being powered

160
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,583
to grind buckwheat!

161
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,250
Aw, yeah! I got the shot!

162
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,875
What, you're a director now?

163
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:07,958
I gotta tell ya,

164
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,708
I never noticed how beautiful
Manoyama really is.

165
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:13,625
[SHIORI]
I'm glad to hear you say that.

166
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,208
The cool thing is that
you've got a bunch of

167
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,416
great filming locations all
packed into a small area!

168

Makes life so much
easier for everyone

169
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,833
working on the shoot, you know?

170
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,416
I'm happy to hear that.

171
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,458
But I... feel like
I should apologize.

172
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:27,583
For this weird stuff.

173
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:28,708
No, no, no.

174
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,541
This is perfect
for what we need.

175
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,750
What kind of movie is this?

176
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,333
[ASST DIRECTOR]
Hey, Fujiwara!

177
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,500
Brace yourself.

178
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,041
Our dear director
is messing around

179
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,208
with the plotline again.

180
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,916
[FUJIWARA]
What? Not again!

181
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,625
Why have you all
come barging in here?

182
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,541
There's no window
shopping allowed.

183
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,875
I know this is kind of
a sudden request,

184
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,791
but is there any
possibility you'd consider

185
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,000
letting us film here?

186
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,666
The director's looking
to shoot in a shop

187
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,708
that has a real historic feel.

188
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,541
[SANAE] This is the only
place we could think of

189
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,625
that fit the bill.

190
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,708
No other shop like it in town!

191
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,666
Hmm. Is that so?

192
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,291
Also, the head of
the tourism board

193
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,625
already gave us permission
to shoot wherever we like.

194
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:09,625
[YOSHINO, SANAE gasp]

195
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,041
[CHITOSE]
Huh?!

196
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,958
The person who told you
that is obviously an imbecile!

197
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,708
I'm the head of
the Board of Merchants!

198
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:16,250
Show a little respect!

199
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,416
It's not like I'll benefit
from helping you out!

200
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,208
You'll only get in the
way of our business!

201
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,416
Go on, get out of here!

202
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,416
[YOSHINO]
Please, ma'am!

203
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,833
[CHITOSE]
Come back yesterday!

204
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,791
Head of the tourism board.

205
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,583
I'm not going to let that
old ass have his way.

206
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,708
<i>Omanju</i> .

207
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,083
[CHITOSE]
Huh?

208
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,875
They're going to have
<i>omanju</i> in the movie.

209
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,791
If you say no, they'll have
to use Chupakabura <i>manju</i> .

210
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:43,791
Are you serious?

211
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,750
Then the worst of Manoyama
would be on full display!

212
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,791
Hey! Come back here!

213
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:53,000
[GROUP snoring]

214
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,291
[YOSHINO]
I'm not really sure how,

215
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,458
but that worked out well!

216
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,458
Yeah, man, that was kinda close.

217
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,666
And it's been just like
that for days now.

218
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,208
One thing after another.

219
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,583
He drove all night from Tokyo

220
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,500
and worked all day
without any breaks.

221
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,458
Wow, the film industry
sounds really tough, huh?

222
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,791
Has it ever gotten
to the point where

223
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,125
you've wanted to quit?

224
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,458
Oh, sure, I've wanted
to quit plenty of times.

225
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,500
But nah, no shoot
lasts forever, you know?

226
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,208
And really, when it
comes down to it,

227
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,458
I love this job.

228
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,791
I'd never quit.

229
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,250
[YOSHINO]
So this is the house, huh?

230
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,541
It's impressive!

231
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,083
I'd say it was built
about sixty years ago.

232
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:33,416
The owners haven't
been living here

233
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,791
for a long time.

234
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,041
They said they
aren't coming back,

235
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,375
and that we can use
the house all we want!

236
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,583
The director's finally here!

237
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,125
It's good to see you, sir!

238
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:48,208
These are the nice folks
from the tourism board.

239
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,708
[YOSHINO] It's a pleasure
to meet you. I'm the--

240
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,750
Yeah, yeah, the pleasure's mine.

241
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,458
So is this the one, then? Hmm.

242
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,875
It's very tidy, don't you think?

243
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,208
Yes, sir.

244
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
When we found out it
would be used for the shoot,

245
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,958
we had some people volunteer,
and they cleaned it right up.

246
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,750
All the sliding doors have been
replaced, the drawers too!

247
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,958
[SHIORI]
It might be old,

248
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,791
but if you put in a
little work, anything--

249
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,125
[SONODA]
It's all wrong! Ugh!

250
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,000
It needs to be beaten up!

251
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:14,666
Why the hell would anybody
do something like this?

252
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,416
It's no good. We can't use it.

253
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,708
But sir, consider.
There's not a whole lot here.

254
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey, there we go!

255
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,625
That one would be great!

256
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,875
It's beautifully worn down.

257
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,666
And it'll look gorgeous
as it burns to the ground!

258
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,791
It's settled!
We'll use that one.

259
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:30,916
Burns to the ground?

260
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,333
Yeah, on the final
day of the shoot,

261
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,541
we'll have to torch
the house for the climax!

262
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,625
[SHIORI gasps]

263
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,208
You'll burn it down for real?

264
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,166
I don't remember seeing
that scene in the script.

265
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,750
No, you can't use that house!

266
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,125
Uh, why?

267
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,541
Well, umm, because it's...

268
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,041
It's really haunted?

269
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:47,250
Yes! That's perfect!

270
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,583
Then it's ideal for
our haunted house story!

271
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,750
Haunted house story?

272
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,083
[SONODA]
Well, that seals the deal.

273
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,375
Get it handled by the
last day of the shoot.

274
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,125
And if you can't, you're gone!

275
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,916
All right! Next location!

276
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,041
[FUJIWARA]
Okay, I guess that's the plan.

277
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,291
[SONODA humming]

278
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,625
[SANAE]
Queen, what do you think?

279
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:04,833
Will it work?

280
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,208
Hey, Shiori, do you
know who owns the house

281
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,458
and where they are?

282
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,083
We need to ask their permission.

283
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,708
I'll take care of everything.

284
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,916
You've got a
million other things

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,333
to be worried about
right now, anyway.

286
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:18,875
[YOSHINO]
Thanks! I'll leave it to you.

287
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,041
Sorry about this, Kosuke.

288
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:29,500
No problem, it's from Mom.

289
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,500
Thank you. A lot. Really.

290
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm off, then.

291
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,333
Gotta get back
before Dad finds out.

292
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,291
[MAKI] Mm-hmm.
Say hi to Mom for me!

293
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,708
[KOSUKE]
Yep!

294
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:41,541
[SANAE yawns] This day really
took it all out of me.

295
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,208
You know, our minister of Oden

296
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,125
could get off her butt
and help out a little.

297
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,500
Hey, be nice, Sanae.

298
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,875
No, she's just pouting
because Mr. Kadota said

299
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,791
she should be a stagehand.

300
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,041
Ignore her.

301
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,666
[YOSHINO]
Maki?

302
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,375
Hey. Welcome home.

303
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,958
I just got a care
package from my brother.

304
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:02,083
Wanna share?

305
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,416
Sorry. I'm a minister, too,

306
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,916
so I know I should
be working on this

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,916
just as hard as
everyone else is.

308
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,583
I know it must've
sucked for him to tell you

309
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,208
to be a stagehand
when you're an actor.

310
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,583
I totally get that.

311
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:20,750
That's not really
the problem, though.

312
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,166
Don't worry.

313
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll cover for you as long
as you need to stay away.

314
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,000
The assistant director
said something earlier today.

315
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,375
His job's killing him,

316
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,791
but he sticks with it
'cause he loves it so much.

317
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:34,000
I realized I've never
had anything in my life

318
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,083
that I was that
passionate about.

319
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,333
I kinda envy him, you know?

320
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,291
Yeah, except loving it
is what makes it so hard.

321
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,666
[YASUDA]
Well, yes, we were related,

322
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,625
but only distant relatives.

323
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:55,833
The place ended up in our name
because there was nobody else

324
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,250
to leave it to.

325
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,500
You can go right ahead
and tear it down or burn it up

326
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,041
or do whatever you want.

327
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,958
It'd actually be helpful!

328
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,541
All right. Thank you so much.

329
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:05,791
[YASUDA]
My pleasure, dear.

330
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,875
[SHIORI] Well, that sure
didn't take long.

331
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,791
"Okay, everyone,
please calm down.

332
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,625
I can understand
why you're angry."

333
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,750
Feels a little stiff.
Who wrote this stuff, anyway?

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,416
"Okay everyone, all right.

335
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,416
Getting mad will only
make you hungry.

336
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,666
Here, why don't you have
one of these <i>manju</i> , 'kay?"

337
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,083
Yes, I'm calling about
the ten extras we requested.

338
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,958
Right, we'll need them here
all afternoon on Tuesday.

339
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,125
Great, I'll look forward
to seeing them then!

340
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,833
So the shoot starts tomorrow.

341
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,708
Of course the boss is ecstatic.

342
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,083
Don't remind me.

343
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,958
You know that was originally
supposed to be my role?

344
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,625
Pretty messed up, huh?

345
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,041
Look at him--he's seriously
like a little kid.

346
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,166
Hey, you're back!

347
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,000
Did everything with
the house go okay?

348
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,333
Oh, right.

349
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,541
I, uh...

350

Unfortunately, I wasn't
able to get in touch

351
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,875
with the owners like we'd hoped.

If we don't get it
by the last day,

00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,833
it'll be a disaster!

Oh, what'll we do now?

Just calm yourself down, Queen.

357
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:03,958
There are plenty
of empty houses.

358

But we can't destroy
them without permission!

359
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,666
Well, they're all
on private property,

360
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,750
so having them demolished
can be pretty expensive.

361
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,333
That's why they're abandoned.

362
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:13,958
Even turning it
into an empty lot

363
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,458
raises the taxes.

00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,791
A vicious cycle.

00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,916
That's why we've got
to take this opportunity

366
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,666
to reduce their numbers--
these "haunted houses."

start with your house?

the demolition bill!

deal for the owners, too!

Is that true?

373
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,791

another empty house then!

What are you doing here?

523
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,666
You can't wander off
like that on your own

524
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,000
without telling me, Moe!

525
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,416
[MOE]
Oh, I'm sorry.

526
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,708
I'll see you 'round, Maki! Bye!

527
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,208
[MOE] Sorry, I hope you
weren't too worried!

528
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,791
[ISOGAI] Just give me
a heads-up next time.

529
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:07,916
[MOE]
I will.

530
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:17,166
[SANAE] So she joined
the same agency after you?

531
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,750
[MAKI]
Yeah, she did.

532
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,916
[SANAE] And now she's
gotten ahead of you.

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,125
Tell me something.

534
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,083
Have you ever eaten a cicada?

535
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,083
[SANAE]
What?

536
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,791
Well, she did. On TV.

537
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,541
You've seen it on
game shows right?

538
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,625
How they make people
eat weird stuff?

539
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,708
Down the hatch, little bug!

540
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,958
[CONTESTANTS gasp, squeal]

541
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:42,291
The way I see it,

542
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,375
it's not something you get
to experience every day,

543
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,791
you know?

544
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,458
And if doing this show can
get me more opportunities

545
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:51,000
as an actor, I'm basically
willing to do anything.

546
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,625
Sure enough,
people talked about it,

547
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,083
and that was how
she ended up getting

548
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,250
her big break.

549
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:56,416
But you're invested.

550
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,958
You took all those
part time jobs to study

551
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,000
for roles, didn't you?

552
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,583
But I wouldn't eat
the damn cicada!

553
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:02,916
I guess that just goes
to show ya

554
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,625
I wasn't as committed
to being an actor

555
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,958
as I should've been.

556
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,125
I think I only wanted to perform

557
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:11,583
because I was praised
for it as a kid,

558
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,041
but I'm through with it.

559
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,250
That whole world.

560
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,958
Are you serious?

561
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,416
[MAKI]
I'm grown up and I'm broke.

562
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,875
If I got my first
role at this point,

563
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,458
I think I'd be embarrassed.

564
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,041
I know they say stick
with it if you love it.

565
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,000
But isn't that like
an abusive relationship?

566
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,833
There's no future for me there.

567
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,625
Your twenties
are a special time.

568
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,541
I kinda wasted mine.

569
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,000
But at least I've
realized it now, huh?

570
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:37,625
I'm gonna try to search really
hard for what I want to do.

571
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:38,666
[SANAE]
How pathetic.

572
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,666
What?

573
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,958
[SANAE]
I can understand setbacks

574
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,500
and wanting to take a break.

575
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,625
I'm in the same boat, after all.

576
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,500
But when you choose
to reject something

577
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,166
that you know you
love so passionately,

578
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,666
it's disgraceful.

579
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,708
Also, you need to
apologize to Yoshino.

580
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,000
You've... You've got to...

581
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,791
You've gotta survive!

582
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,375
Takeshi!

583
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,541
[SANDAL] I have a coffee table
book about Taiga Hiyama.

584
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,791
I accidentally bought it online.

585
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,500
Next time:
"The Mansion in Purgatory."
