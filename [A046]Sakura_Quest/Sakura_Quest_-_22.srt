1
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,625
[USHIMATSU]
Hey!

2
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,666
Thought I'd find
you in here, Hide.

3
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,625
Whoa! Would you look at that!
You've outdone yourself!

4
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:48,166
Well, I'm not finished yet,

5
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,125
but as soon as we attach the
Golden Dragon and the sculptures

6
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,583
from the wood carving district,
it'll be good to go!

7
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:57,041
The queen's searching for the
Golden Dragon as we speak, so...

8
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,000
I sure hope she finds it.

9
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,333
I do too.

10
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:01,333
Oh, yeah.

11
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,416
Got a little
present here for ya.

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,416
How incredibly generous!

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,458
That's not like you.

14
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,166
[USHIMATSU]
Wha'd'you mean?

15
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,625
Who's being generous?

16
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,958
Come on, go ahead
and take it, would you?

17
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,416
You sure?

18
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,708
Well, thank you.

19
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,833
There are probably others
who deserve it more.

20
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,333
But I'll just accept it
and be grateful.

21
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:20,208
Hey, you were gonna talk
to the Board of Merchants.

22
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,333
Have you done that?

23
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,708
[USHIMATSU]
Hmm...

24
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,125
[TAKAMIZAWA sighs]

25
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,833
It's no use,
I'm totally stumped.

26
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,750
If we don't hurry, we'll
lose the light completely.

27
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,916
And the forecast said it's
supposed to snow tonight, too.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,291
[KANEDA] You're the one
who made this thing!

29
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:38,291
How could you forget it?

30
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,541
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Ask Noge!

31
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,791
Come on, are you serious?

32
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,583
It happened almost 30 years ago.

33
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:43,833
What're you gonna do?

34
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,208
We're looking at a man
who can't crack a code

35
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,041
made by a kid in grade school.

36
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,666
I hope they've found it.

37
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,208
Wouldn't that be cool?

38
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,208
Yeah, but I wouldn't get my
hopes up too high if I were you.

39
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,041
Erika. Feeling any better?

40
00:02:58,125 --> 00:02:59,625
What's the end of the story?

41
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:00,583
I wanna know.

42
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,916
Wait, what story?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,458
The one you told
me about the girl

44
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:05,958
that wore a wedding dress
to the crepe cafe.

45
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,916
[laughs]

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,083
Oh, that thing.

47
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,125
What'd she say when
she came up to you?

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,250
All she wanted was to know if
she could change clothes there,

49
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:15,583
because she'd just run
away from her own wedding.

50
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,958
Can you believe that?

51
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:17,958
[ERIKA]
Why?

52
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:19,833
She apparently changed her mind.

53
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,041
She told me she'd always
wanted to get married,

54
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,875
but then, when the day of
the wedding finally arrived,

55
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,708
it just didn't feel right.

56
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,958
Is the moral of this story

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,916
that dreams and
reality are different?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,958
What? Okay,
that's really stupid.

59
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,083
Are you saying it's
the same with Tokyo?

60
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,875
Yeah. Also, it's not
enough just to want it.

61
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:39,875
You have to have a plan
and resolve to work toward it.

62
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:41,333
Maybe that's true.

63
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,666
But I'm not gonna
give up my dream

64
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,708
and waste my youth around here!

65
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,083
I might not know what it's
really like, but you know what?

66
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,458
Neither do you, Shi!

67
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,250
You're just out of touch
in whole a different way!

68
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
Great, it's snowing.

69
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,958
What are we doing trying
to crack this out in the cold?

70
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,208
We should have figured it out
<i>before</i> we came outside.

71
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:08,666
[RIRIKO]
Huh... Read vertically.

72
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,833
Vertically?

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,916
[RIRIKO]
Here.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,375
[YOSHINO]
"From rabbit, 2,427 step."

75
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,458
What rabbit?

76
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,333
I though we were
in Hippo Park, right?

77
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,833
Hey, wait.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,041
[NOGE]
Huh. Behold, the rabbit!

79
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh!

80
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:27,250
We gotta walk
2,427 steps from here?

81
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,583
But there's no way

82
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,708
that could even be in
the park still, could it?

83
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,208
[ALL]
Hmm...

84
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,708
Two thousand, four hundred
and twenty-seven steps

85
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,041
is easily over a kilometer.

86
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,500
Noge, You said you're sure you
guys buried it in Hippo Park?

87
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,125
Yeah, I feel pretty
certain that's what we did.

88
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,166
I wonder if it's not
buried there anymore.

89
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,125
What? Did someone beat us to it?

90
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,375
In our yearbook,

91
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,000
you specifically wrote
that your big dream was

92
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,000
to be the owner of your
very own book store.

93
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,583
Your wish was granted,
wasn't it?

94
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,625
By that logic,
you and Takamizawa

96
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,166
had your wishes
granted, too, in a way.

97
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,083
A champion of justice,
and an F1 racer?

98
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:10,541
They might've manifested
in different forms,

99
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,166
but they're pretty close.

100
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,291
Wow, I guess that's true,
depending on how you look at it.

101
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,791
Are you saying your
wish really came true?

102
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:19,583
Heh. Life's complicated,

103
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,208
but I guess from a certain
point of view, it really has.

104
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,916
Maybe the Shining Dragon's
been granting wishes

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,833
the whole time it's
been buried there.

106
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,041
Oh...

107
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:30,208
[SANAE] What is it you wish
to be when you grow up, Anji?

108
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,958
I wanna be a taiko drummer!

109
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, just like
Maki's little brother!

110
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,500
Wow!

111
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,541
[ANJI] And my sister wants
to own a cool clothing store.

112
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,583
She said so in her
yearbook last year.

113
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,583
Whoa, a cool
clothing store, huh?

114
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:44,291
That's actually a little
surprising, somehow.

115
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:47,500
Ha! She'd probably
yell at all the customers.

116
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,083
Hey, Noge, I was wondering,

117
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:51,666
did you inherit your
bookstore from your family?

118
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,916
Nah.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,125
I've just always been
passionate about books.

120
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,791
I went to that bookstore all
the time when I was growing up.

121
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,458
Couldn't stay away.

122
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,083
One day, I heard that
the owner was planning

123
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:04,166
to close up shop and
move in with his son, so...

124
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,125
...I begged him,
and that's how I ended up

125
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,291
with the house
and the bookstore.

126
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,875
How cool! That's so amazing!

127
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,375
I wanted a store like the one

128
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,000
that always made me
so excited as a kid.

129
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,458
So that's how I've been
trying to run that place.

130
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,458
But it hasn't been easy,
if I'm telling the truth.

131
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,125
The number of children
keeps decreasing every year,

132
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:24,541
and a little bookstore isn't the
best business plan, anyway.

133
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,916
I'm really only able to sell
a few kinds of things.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,583
Magazines and best sellers.

135
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:30,666
I wanted people
to read foreign sci-fi,

136
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,916
photography books, crazy
mysteries, and great literature.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,291
But nobody gives
them a second thought.

138
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,541
I like all of those things.

139
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,333
Hearing even one person
say that makes me happy.

140
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,666
It really does.

141
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,833
I wish though.

142
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,041
Well, it seems having
your dream come true

143
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,583
isn't the end all, be all.

144
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,750
Sounds like that's when
the real work begins.

145
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,375
Like when the
heroine of a fairy tale

146
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,166
happily marries the
prince of her dreams,

147
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,666
but we always forget:

148
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,416
The reality is
that living together

149
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,083
as a couple is very challenging.

150
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,708
I think it's important that
you dream bigger, Sanae.

151
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,708
[SHIORI]
So, that's the original code?

152
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:05,958
[RIRIKO]
Mm-hm.

153
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,916
[SANAE] Hey, is anyone
up for a little wager?

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,375
We can place bets on who
will end up cracking the code.

155
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,166
And we'll all buy the
winner whatever they want!

156
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,791
[MAKI]
Ooh, I like it!

157
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,083
[SHIORI]
Erika, what do you think?

158
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,125
Hey, what's wrong?

159
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,583
Nothing, I'm fine.

160
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,000
You know, Erika, Anji's been
pretty worried about you.

161
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,916
Isn't it time to think
about going home?

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,583
No! I still don't want to.

163
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:25,583
Why, though?

164
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:26,708
It's not easy for your mom,

165
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,500
running the restaurant
all by herself.

166
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,208
Are you saying I have
to keep working there

167
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,625
for the rest of my life?

168
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,833
I don't wanna grow old

169
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:34,666
out in the middle of
nowhere, making curry.

170
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,250
But it's fine to grow
old in the city? Uh!

171
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,291
What's wrong?

172
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,416
I had deja vu
for a second there,

173
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,416
remembering that my mom
told me the exact same thing

174
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,916
when was I having
trouble finding a job.

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now you're the one
handing out the advice.

176
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,916
I'd say that means
you've grown up, Yoshino.

177
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:57,541
Hey, since it's snowing
pretty hard right now.

178
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,541
Would you mind if
I stayed the night here?

179
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:00,958
Of course not! Duh!

180
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,208
Why don't you
stay over too, Riichan?

181
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,875
We've got a brand-new sleeping
bag and it's really cool.

182
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,166
Like being a pharaoh--

183
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,333
I'll stay.

184
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,041
[SHIORI]
Good, that settles it, then!

185
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,791
[MAKI]
Wanna see it?

186
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,875
[RIRIKO]
Yeah.

187
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,541
[SHIORI]
Do you mind if I join you?

188
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,541
I don't care.

189
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,541
Do whatever you want.

190
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,291
Yay! That's just what I'll do.

191
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,750
Bit of a squeeze, huh?

192
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,708
[sighs]

193
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,750
That feels good.

194
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
They're floating.

195
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,791
Wait, are you showing off?

196
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,875
[SHIORI] I was just thinking
about what you said.

197
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,250
Huh?

198
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,333
That I don't know what
it's like out there, either.

199
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,666
How we're both out
of touch, just differently.

200
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,791
I think you're absolutely
right about all that.

201
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,583
If you don't like Manoyama
and you want to go off to Tokyo,

202
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,208
well then that means
you have a dream

203
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,291
you can shoot for and
I believe that's a lovely thing.

204
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,458
You have something exciting
you can think and plan for.

205
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,416
Which means,
you can take your time.

206
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,083
You don't need to
force it to come true

207
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:09,875
while you're still so young.

208
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,458
[ERIKA]
I want it to come true now.

209
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,750
But, realistically,
you're still in middle school,

210
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:17,041
so you can't leave home and go
live all by yourself right now.

211
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,500
Don't you think I know that?

212
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,125
I just can't stand it any more!

213
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:22,750
In this dumb town, I can't
tell if I'm alive or dead.

214
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,708
I gotta get out of
here as fast as I can!

215
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,125
I'm pretty sure you're not dead.

216
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,625
Erika, sometimes
life's just putting one foot

217
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:31,833
in front of the other.

218
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,125
Do you know what I mean?

219
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,583
Erika?

220
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,208
Ow!

221
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:38,958
[SHIORI]
What is it?

222
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:39,958
Erika?

223
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,916
[ERIKA]
Ow, ow, ow!

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,958
Oh, yeah, that's a bummer.

225
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,125
The trauma of becoming an adult.

226
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,541
You've got a baby molar
that wants to come out.

227
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,083
Baby teeth.

228
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,541
Are you supposed to still have
baby teeth in middle school?

229
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,041
Our new teeth always
grow in from the front,

230
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,833
so molars are the last to go.

231
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,166
For most people,

232
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,750
they're usually gone
by the end of grade school,

233
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,625
but some kids Erika's age
still have 'em. No biggie.

234
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,791
You sure know a
lot about this, Maki!

235
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,666
Yeah, well I had a part-time
job as a dental assistant.

236
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,083
No matter how you say it,

237
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,375
what it comes down to
is that Erika is still a kid!

238
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,416
Am not! Erk!

239
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,500
For now you can
take some painkillers

240
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,708
and tomorrow we'll
take you to the dentist.

241
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,375
You can't give her those, Yoshi!

242
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:22,791
She's not an adult.

243
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:25,125
People under 15 aren't
supposed to take 'em.

244
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,500
Oh, you're right!

245
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,958
We don't have anything
here that a kid could take.

246
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess we'll have
to call Angelica.

247
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,916
No, no!
Please don't tell my mom!

248
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,458
If you do, I'll leave
right now, I swear.

249
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,583
Erika...

250
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,125
Should I buy some, then?

251
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,541
Where, though?

252
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,583
There's literally nothing
open in town at this hour.

253
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,041
Shichan, can you call
and ask Sayuri for advice?

254
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,791
I would, but she just left on
a trip to Okinawa with Kumano.

255
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,208
[SANAE]
At a time like this?

256
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,541
And when did those
two get together?

257
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,291
Maybe Mr. Kadota could help!

258
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,291
Or he could make it a lot worse,
it's so hard to say.

259
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,791
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

260
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,041
I found it!

261
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,791
Teeth from the bottom
get thrown on the roof,

262
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,583
and teeth on the top,
thrown under the porch!

263
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,583
The teeth actually
have to come out first.

264
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,666
There's a pressure point
that'll relieve the pain.

265
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,708
Oh! I've never heard
about that one!

266
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,083
Hi, do we have
children's pain reliever?

267
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,375
Huh? Children's pain reliever?

268
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,958
There's no way we still have
any of that stuff around.

269
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,416
What in the world do
you need it for anyway?

270
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,083
[YOSHINO]
Okay, little pressure point.

271
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,208
Let's give it a shot!

272
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,458
Hey! Keep your hands off of me!

273
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,333
Come on, hold still, Erika!

274
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,500
If I don't touch you,
I can't cure the pain!

275
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:30,583
[MAKI]
Okay now, okay.

276
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:31,666
That tickles!

277
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,958
[MAKI]
Hold still.

278
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,333
[YOSHINO]
Got it!

279
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,916
Sorry, that was the
pressure point for constipation.

280
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,625
[screams]

281
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:40,125
She said we should
go to the pharmacy

282
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,583
in the shopping district.

283
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,750
[YOSHINO]
Huh?

284
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,333
Don't you think it'll
be closed, though?

285
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,250
[RIRIKO]
That's what I thought,

286
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,125
but Grandma said
she'd call them,

287
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,166
and they'd willing to
open up the store for us.

288
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,375
Is this all you need, hon?

289
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,458
[YOSHINO]
Yes, thanks!

290
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,083
Sorry to bother you so late.

291
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,458
It's no problem.

292
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,333
This is exactly what
the pharmacy is here for.

293
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,375
We appreciate it very much!

294
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,250
Now be careful out there.

295
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,500
[YOSHINO]
Thank you so much for your help!

296
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,000
No thanks are necessary.

297
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,041
You hurry back home and
get her that medicine, okay?

298
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,375
Yep!

299
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,916
[MAKI]
Glad that's done.

300
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,208
Yeah, except
I feel kind of bad now.

301
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,875
I always shop at the
drug store in the supermarket.

302
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,875
I never go to the pharmacy
in the shopping district.

303
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,416
That's understandable.

304
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,333
But you can only get service
like this in local shops.

305
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:40,583
Wow, this is...

306
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,750
...not even close
to being expired yet.

307
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,458
It looks like they
manage their inventory

308
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,208
really well at that store.

309
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,166
Well, yeah, what did you expect?

310
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,958
Of course, yeah.

311
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,208
You know,
I really love Manoyama.

312
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:54,250
No matter what people say.

313
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,250
Even if folks continue
to want to leave this place,

314
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,041
and they move off to the city,

315
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,375
and Manoyama empties
out even more.

316
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:04,250
Even if it keeps getting
smaller and smaller.

317
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,041
I'll never stop loving this
town, and I'll never leave it!

318
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:11,708
[ringing]

319
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,625
You've reached the dorm.

320
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,291
No, he's not here.

321
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,333
What happened?

322
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,291
Is Anji missing?

323
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,916
[ANGELICA] It's just, Anji
hasn't come back yet.

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,916
He's gone!

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,875
[police siren]

326
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,625
Anji!

327
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,708
--Anji!
--Anji!

328
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,125
Answer us if you're out here!

329
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,916
Anji!

330
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,541
Hey, no worries. He'll be fine.

331
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,708
So, you're positive
he's not there?

332
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,833
Okay.

333
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,708
Well, if you hear anything.

334
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,708
Yeah.

335
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,833
I appreciate it.

336
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,875
Any sign of him at all?

337
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:57,166
[YOSHINO]
Uh-uh.

338
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,833
We checked the
shopping district.

339
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,125
But the snow makes
it really hard to see anything.

340
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,791
Still, though, he's just a kid.

341
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,625
There's no way he
could've gotten that far

342
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,000
by now, is there?

343
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,083
Where do we think he would
go in snow like this?

344
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,666
I have a thought!

345
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,291
Maybe the Shining Dragon's
been granting wishes

346
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,291
the whole time it's
been buried there.

347
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,541
[YOSHINO] You don't
think he went looking

348
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,750
for the Golden Dragon?

349
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,750
Maybe he's hoping
it might grant his wish

350
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,041
and bring Erika back home
to him and his mom.

351
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,625
Let's try Hippo Park!

352
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,958
[SANAE]
Anji!

353
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,416
[YOSHINO]
If you're out there, respond!

354
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,708
--Anji!
--Anji!

355
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey!

356
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:28,750
[KANEDA]
Anji!

357
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,833
Look over there!

358
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,000
Anji!

359
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,875
Not him. That's just a hippo.

360
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,291
[YOSHINO sighs]
What a relief.

361
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,583
[SANAE]
Sorry, that was my fault.

362
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,541
Hello?

363
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,000
[SANDAL]
Hey, Kindaichi!

364
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,291
Could you tell me how
to brew heartleaf tea?

365
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:47,708
[KANEDA]
Huh?

366
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,416
[SANDAL] Oh, I found Anji
out in the park a bit ago,

367
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,000
so I brought him to
the police box to warm up.

368
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,666
He asked me if I could make
him some hot heartleaf tea.

369
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,583
Anji!

370
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,541
[ANJI]
I'm sorry, Mom.

371
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,625
What a relief.

372
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,208
[SANAE]
Mm.

373
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:08,958
[ANGELICA]
Erika.

374
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,916
You're really here!

375
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,416
Erika... I...
Please don't leave us.

376
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,416
Ever again.

377
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,541
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Come on, talk to him, Erika.

378
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,708
Give him your word
you won't leave again.

379
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:25,958
You never know.

380
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,625
Your dream just might
come true in Manoyama

381
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:29,541
without you having to move away.

382
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,916
If you want to own
a clothing store,

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,333
that doesn't necessarily
mean you have to go, right?

384
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,791
If you talk to one of the older
owners in the shopping district,

385
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,666
they might let you take over.

386
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,958
That's how I ended up with
my bookstore, you know.

387
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,708
[screams]

388
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,791
Nobody is going
to want to buy cool clothes

389
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,791
in this crappy
little backwards town!

390
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,250
Who's even gonna
notice your cute clothes

391
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,541
when you're walking
around in rice fields?

392
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,916
Cows? Tanukis?

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The town isn't even
lit up at night!

394
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:01,666
It's so dark and empty
it's like it doesn't even exist!

395
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,625
[ANJI]
Okay! Then I'll do it!

396
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,708
Huh?

397
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,125
I'm gonna open up
a clothing store,

398
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,083
and it'll be all for you, Erika!

399
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:11,125
I'll make it so you won't hate
living in this town anymore.

400
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:16,250
I'll make it so you'll want
to stay here with us forever!

401
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,916
Anji.

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,083
[ANJI]
Please don't go.

403
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,041
I think I get it now.

404
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:40,208
We adults need
to get our act together.

405
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,291
We need to make this
a town where young people

406
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,666
will want to stay and
really invest their lives.

407
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, we should
do something, then.

408
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,916
What?

409
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,833
I'm thinking about the middle
school that closed down.

410
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,958
Did you hear that the Chief
Handywoman is starting up

411
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,250
an acting troupe that
rehearses in the gym.

412
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,541
There are a bunch of
other empty classrooms.

413
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,083
We could use those somehow.

414
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,625
Yeah, we could put together
Noge's jazz and books,

415
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,375
and we could even have
a heartleaf tea cafe!

416
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,750
Haha. I like it except
for the heartleaf part.

417
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,083
What? Why?
It's the most delicious tea!

418
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,500
[TAKAMIZAWA] Also, if I ever
get fired from the bus company,

419
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,750
I'd want to work there.

420
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,250
So it's kinda like
insurance, too.

421
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,583
[NOGE]
Wait, so, now I'm responsible

422
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,291
for your fallback career?

423
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:19,541
[laughter]

424
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,625
[ANGELICA]
Are you not hungry at all?

425
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,041
I've got some tasty cookies.

426
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:46,875
[crunch]

427
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:50,916
[ANGELICA]
What is it?

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,375
Tooth came out.

429
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,083
Oh, you'd better go
throw it out the window.

430
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,250
Do I throw it up?

431
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,750
Or at the ground?

432
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,250
Either one works.

433
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,958
Throw it whichever way you like,

434
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,500
but be sure to throw it
as hard as you can.

435
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,041
Apparently Noge
submitted a proposal

436
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,750
to the Board of Education.

437
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,125
He wants to make a book cafe

438
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:15,916
in one of the school's
old classrooms.

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,541
[RIRIKO]
He's really doing it.

440
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,083
[MAKI]
And interest is spreading.

441
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,750
Now, other people are saying
they want to open shops there.

442
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,166
[SANAE] Maybe I'll start
something up, too.

443
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:28,416
Lunch combo A: beef steak,
combo B: ginger pork.

444
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,750
I recommend the curry.

445
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
Erika, you can be
more friendly than that.

446
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,166
After all, they let you
stay in their dorm,

447
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,083
and told you a
bunch of cool stories.

448
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,041
Whatever. They let me stay
there, but their stories?

449
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,000
Totally useless.

450
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,916
Erika, how 'bout we
visit Tokyo together?

451
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,750
Maybe for a long weekend?

452
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,541
Nah. When I go,
I'll go by myself.

453
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,541
But maybe...

454
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,333
...I'll bring you back a gift.

455
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,958
Well, guess there's nothing
new down here today, is there?

456
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,458
But that's what's good about it.

457
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,791
[MAKI] If people want to
do something, like Noge,

458
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,916
they can do it,
and people that don't want

459
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,791
a change can stay as they are.

460
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:32,083
Because that's a
completely valid option.

461
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,833
I wonder if all that's left
for this old shopping district

462
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,750
is to finish its purpose
and quietly fade away.

463
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,083
Oh, man.

464
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,666
That would be pretty sad,
though, don't you think?

465
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,875
That's it!

466
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,875
I know just what we can do!

467
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,291
Huh? What the heck
is going on here?

468
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:57,166
These are Hanging Toro
Lanterns I've brought them over,

469
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,875
from Warabiya village.

470
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,375
I went around to
a bunch of houses,

471
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,625
and asked if I could
have their old ones.

472
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:04,541
See, they're Toro
Lanterns that you hang

473
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,500
from the edge of your roof
at night to let people know

474
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,875
that everything is okay.

475
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,666
No, I know what they are.

476
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,291
But what are you planning
to do with all of these things?

477
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,291
We're going to hang them up

478
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,083
all around the
shopping district.

479
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,958
Then it will still seem
inviting down there

480
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,500
even when the
stores are shuttered.

481
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,583
And, you'll easily
be able to tell

482
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,666
that people still live there!

483
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,416
We had Doku take
a look at the fixtures

484
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,791
and install LEDs in them.

485
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:26,875
That means there's
no fire risk, now!

486
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,291
[RIRIKO]
Mm.

487
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,375
Well, not bad.

488
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,083
This is really not bad at all.

489
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,166
This brings back memories.

490
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,291
I used to hang out
in Warabiya village a lot

491
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,000
when I was much younger.

492
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,041
Of course! I don't
mind putting it up a bit.

493
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,250
Great idea!

494
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,250
Just one more thing to enjoy!

495
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,916
Thanks! I'm so glad you like it!

496
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,458
[SANAE]
Huh? Noge's not here?

497
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,791
Oh, that's right!

498
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,500
Takamizawa was saying
they were going to dig up

499
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:55,833
the Shining Dragon,
so he probably went along.

500
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,708
Did they actually
crack the code?

501
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,375
The first two numbers
were two and four,

502
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,375
which you know,
together, reads "west."

503
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,541
We were reading them separately,

504
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,708
but the code was actually
"west 27 steps"!

505
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,541
[TAKAMIZAWA]
Okay. Let's do this.

506
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,125
[KANEDA]
It's just a freakin' toy!

507
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,958
So, I guess it wasn't
a festival treasure.

508
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,666
[TAKAMIZAWA] The queen is
gonna be pretty bummed, huh?

509
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,208
Oh well.

510
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,416
I remember it looking so, like
so much more solid and cool.

511
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Oh, I don't know.

512
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,125
Noge, think we should
try making a wish anyway?

513
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,916
Sure! Why not, right?

514
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,125
Uh?

515
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,666
[YOSHINO]
Hey!

516
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,625
I guess you really can't
wait for someone else

517
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,250
to make your wishes come true.

518
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:05,583
You've got to do it yourself.

519
00:23:39,583 --> 00:23:42,125
[SANDAL] When I was little,
I wanted to be a firetruck.

520
