00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,750
[SANAE] Today marks the
beginning of a new journey!

2
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:47,666
I got a sudden request from
the local tourism board.

3
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,875
I'll be working with
them on a rural rejuvenation

4
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,125
project as the Minister of IT!

5
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:54,000
So that means I'm moving
out of the old house

6
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,541
where I've been living alone
for the last six months,

7
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:59,333
and into to a big cabin
with my new friends!

8
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,166
[RIRIKO] Unfortunately,
I'm afraid that means

9
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,166
I'll also be forced
to say goodbye to all

10
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,750
of my little bug pals.

11
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,500
Not cool!
No peeking at my blog!

12
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,791
[MAKI]
Bug pals, huh?

13
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,416
What, are you
writing fiction now?

14
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,208
Shut it, Oden Detective!

15
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,125
Yeah, I have a slightly
different persona in my blog.

16
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:16,541
That doesn't mean
I'm lying or anything.

17
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,250
[SANAE screams]

18
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,750
Get it, Shiori! Get it!

19
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,625
--[SHIORI] Where is it?
--[SANAE] I don't know! Find it!

20
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,666
[SHIORI]
Umm...

21
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,000
[YOSHINO]
Hey, what's that?

22
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:26,791
It's amazing!

23
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:28,208
<i>Ranma</i> .

24
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,291
You've never heard of it?

25
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,750
No, I know about <i>ranma</i> .

26
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,708
I've just never seen
any like this one.

27
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,875
The detail in the carving
is really incredible,

28
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,416
don't you think?

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,833
<i>Ranma</i> carving is officially

30
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,583
one of Manoyama's
traditional arts.

31
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:42,875
There's a wood carving
district in Monzenmachi,

32
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,041
where the shops are,

33
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,750
and there are lots
of sculptors down there!

34
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,333
Wow, I didn't know that.

35
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,541
I don't get how you
could possibly miss it.

36
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,791
What've you been doing here
for the past half year?

37
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,083
Well, what do you think?
I was working, of course!

38
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:55,625
And I like working
at home a lot,

39
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,333
surrounded by all
of these antiques!

40
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:59,208
It's very inspiring!

41
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,500
Kind of like combining
the old and the new!

42
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:05,583
[USHIMATSU sighs]
Finished.

43
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,708
Is the old man here?

44
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,083
What do you want, woman?

45
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,833
Don't pull my granddaughter
into your weird schemes.

46
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:17,375
What's this "minister" crap?

47
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,375
Ririko joined of
her own free will!

48
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,375
Well, I'm her legal guardian
and I don't like it!

49
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,041
[USHIMATSU] Don't come after me
just 'cause your granddaughter

50
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,375
betrayed you, hag!

51
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,583
[CHITOSE] You'd better
watch what you say to me,

52
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:26,875
you old ass!

53
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:31,541
[engine revving]

54
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:33,666
[SHIORI]
Oh, no, come on.

55
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,166
I wonder if my dad
messed something up

56
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,666
when he tuned it up himself.

57
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,083
Will it be okay?

58
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:39,416
No, I think it's dead.

59
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,458
Let's ask Doku for help.

60
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,583
Yeah, you're right.

61
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,500
I guess it is time
to bring it to Doku.

62
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,833
Hang on, Doku?

63
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,416
Like, that Doku?

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,125
Who's this Doku person?

65
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:55,916
[doorbell ringing]

66
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,666
[beeping]

67
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,875
[YOSHINO]
A vending machine?

68
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,875
No way!
You gotta be kiddin' me!

69
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,166
It wouldn't transform
for me no matter what I did!

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,375
It was you!

71
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:23,583
How did you do it?

72
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,291
How did you get it to start up?

73
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,375
I-I don't know!

74
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,750
I mean, it wasn't
anything special.

75
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,000
I just kind of touched it!

76
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,166
There it is, then!
That's the answer!

77
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,083
My dried-up hands
don't have the necessary

78
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,125
hyaluronic acid and yours do!

79
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,041
'Kay, that should do it.

80
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,625
Go ahead and try
to start her up.

81
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:43,333
[YOSHINO]
Oh!

82
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,166
[engine revs, starts]

83
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:49,458
So he's not just
some weirdo, then.

84
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,708
[MAKI]
Thanks a lot, Doku.

85
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,625
You can send the bill
to the tourism board.

86
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,333
Just make sure
you address it to me.

87
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,875
Ushimatsu sure hasn't
changed, has he?

88
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,750
I kept telling him, it should be
the Kingdom of Mechakabura,

89
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,625
not the Kingdom of Chupakabura.

90
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,125
Not much of an improvement.

91
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:04,458
Hey, that's right!

92
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,916
You guys are in the middle
of moving, aren't you?

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,666
What a perfect opportunity.

94
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,291
[YOSHINO]
What is that?

95
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,416
[DOKUSHIMA] Prototype for
my powered exoskeleton.

96
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,208
The Hercules 2.0!

97
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,458
[chuckles]

98
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,416
Give it a try.
Let me know what you think!

99
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,125
[YOSHINO laughs]

100
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,416
Wow! This thing
is so incredible!

101
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,791
Hey, be careful!
There's a hard drive in there!

102
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,833
Would you like to
try out the suit, too?

103
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,291
Yeah, kinda.

104
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,666
Okay!

105
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,166
Once you're finished with that,
then we can switch!

106
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,208
Hey, hold on a second.
That's not her room;

107
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,375
I thought it was yours!

108
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,708
Oh, I decided to
let Sanae have it.

109
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,708
I'm gonna move into
the loft on the 2nd floor.

110
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,583
You know, I'm not loving
how you make it sound

111
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,750
like I'm totally
in your debt now.

112
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:51,916
What's wrong?

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,250
I don't know.

114
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,750
Guess I'm just happy to
have friends here with me.

115
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,791
It's gonna be so much fun!

116
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,583
Well, don't forget,
my work as Minister

117
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,291
is only a side job.

118
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,833
I've still got my
normal work, too,

119
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,166
so we'll see how
helpful I'll actually be.

120
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,750
I'm starving.

121
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,583
Anyone up for a break?

122
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,958
Move-in noodles.

123
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,000
How 'bout we go to Angelica's?

124
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,166
The special of the day
is katsu curry.

125
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,458
I could cook for us.

126
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,833
I brought some soba noodles
with me from home.

127
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,625
Just give me a few
minutes to boil them!

128
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,041
Look at you!

129
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:27,333
We've got a domestic
goddess on our hands.

130
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,791
[USHIMATSU]
Listen up, everyone.

131
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,625
Now, I know I've been coming up
with the trials for you.

132
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,041
However, from now on,

133
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,583
you'll have to create
and complete them

134
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,666
all on your own.

135
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,875
So basically,
you ran out of ideas?

136
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,958
Okay.

137
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:42,833
To make it clear,
Miss Smarty-pants,

138
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:44,958
the point is, you can't
just hang out here

139
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,625
all day doing nothing!

140
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,583
You need to
think for yourselves!

141
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,000
How can we draw
a bunch of tourists

142
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,416
and make the town some money?

143
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
[YOSHINO]
I know!

144
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,291
How 'bout the wood
carving district?

145
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,666
What about it?

146
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,791
Oh, well, I was really
impressed with the <i>ranma</i>

147
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,333
in Sanae's house!

148
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,125
I thought maybe we
could use some of that

149
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,166
to promote the town!

150
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,250
Huh...

151
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,833
I can't wait to start tomorrow!

152
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:11,541
Okay, what do you
want us to do first?

153
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:12,458
[YOSHINO]
I think we should check out

154
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,958
the wood carving district.

155
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,125
[SANAE yells]

156
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,000
It's a bean.
Will you chill out?

157
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,916
See? No bug, no worries!

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,333
Why did you move
all the way out here

159
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,708
to the country if you
hate bugs so much?

160
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,583
Look, how was I
to know I hated them?

161
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:29,166
I had to move out here
in order to find that out.

162
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,166
I mean, it's not like
there are tons of bugs

163
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,875
creeping around in Tokyo.

164
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,291
[CHITOSE]
Ririko.

165
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,208
Look, I think it's fine
if you want to work

166
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,750
with the queen.

167
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,750
However, you need to tell me
what you're doing over there.

168
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,500
This is the wood
carving district.

169
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,458
[SANAE] Kinda small
to be called a "district."

170
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,750
[SHIORI] Lots of <i>bushi</i> gathered
here because of all the temples,

171
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,833
so it ended up becoming
a center for wood-carving.

172
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,000
What're <i>bushi</i> ?

173
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,833
Sculptors that carve
Buddhist images.

174
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,875
[SANAE]
Oh.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,291
[YAMADA] The Queen and her
ministers seem pretty excited.

176
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,625
Didn't you tell them that we
tried promoting Manoyama's

177
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,333
wood carving several
times before,

178
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,708
and it failed miserably?

179
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,000
It did not fail.

180
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,416
We just haven't seen
any of the results yet.

181
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,333
With all due respect,
I actually think we have.

182
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,375
He was made honorary mayor
of the wood carving district.

183
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:50,500
He had a bunch of
Chupakabura figurines carved

184
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,791
and now he's stuck
with a stockpile of 'em.

185
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,875
That sucks.

186
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,041
Listen! Our young queen
from out of town

187
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,416
found it interesting
and I think that says a lot!

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,708
She shows more promise
than the two of you idiots!

189
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,000
[MAKI yawns]

190
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,291
Hey, look at these, Sanae!

191
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,375
Aren't they so cute?

192
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:12,291
But a <i>kabura</i> carving
is a little mundane,

193
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,708
don't you think?

194
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,416
Nah! I think their familiarity
is what makes 'em cute.

195
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,458
[TATSUO]
They make wonderful souvenirs!

196
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,625
We have a special
promotion going on now!

197
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:22,666
Buy one and you'll get
a Chupakabura figurine,

198
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,125
free of charge!

199
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,375
Oh, wow!

200
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,375
Thanks a lot, but that's
really not necessary.

201
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,875
Also, we can personalize it

202
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,041
by carving your name
into the back!

203
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,750
Hey there, Tatsuo!

204
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,666
Yeah, I'm afraid
they're not tourists!

205
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,833
We're here to check things out

206
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,250
for a wood carving
district PR campaign!

207
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,458
I'm the queen, Yoshino Koharu!

208
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,750
This is Ms. Kouzuki,
Minister of IT.

209
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,875
Oh! The queen and a minister!

210
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,958
I'm so sorry, I had no idea!

211
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,666
I hope you can forgive me.

212
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
[chuckles]

213
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:51,958
[BOTH laugh]

214
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:54,166
[TATSUO]
Oh, you're back early!

215
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,583
Hey, this is the new queen!

216
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,958
Nice to meet you!

217
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,500
This is Kazushi,
the senior apprentice here.

218
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,625
So you both moved to Manoyama
specifically to do this?

219
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,333
Right. Kazushi moved all
the way from Hokkaido.

220
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,916
But I'm just from Osaka.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,333
I moved here from Tokyo!

222
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,541
Oh, that's cool!

223
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:12,833
Enjoy yourselves.

224
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,916
[TATSUO chuckles]

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,375
Sorry, he's not
a very sociable guy.

226
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,208
But he is one of the best
when it comes to sculpting!

227
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,416
And if you're gonna be
promoting Manoyama Wood Carving,

228
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,750
then believe you me, ladies,

229
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,291
we're gonna help out
as much as we can!

230
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,583
[YOSHINO]
That'd be terrific!

231
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,083
[YOSHINO]
Let's get to it!

232
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,958
We need to find a
strategy to draw tourists

233
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,541
to the wood carving district!

234
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:47,083
And I think we should call it
the WCD Tourism Plan for short!

235
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,750
Oh, one thing first, Yoshi.

236
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:51,458
I gathered some studies
on our past PR failures.

237
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,375
We don't want to make
the same mistakes,

238
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,291
so I thought we
should review them.

239
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,333
This is going to be difficult
no matter what angle we try.

240
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,541
How much demand could there be

241
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,625
for wood carvings
in the first place?

242
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,833
[SHIORI]
You're right.

243
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,458
These days, few houses
are made with places

244
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,041
to put up sculptures,
and even fewer have <i>ranma</i> .

245
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,500
When I was little,
we had a carving of a bear

246
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,958
on top of our television.

247
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,166
[MAKI]
Now, TVs are so thin,

248
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,708
you can't put anything
on top of 'em.

249
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,625
Hey! Then why don't we
make skinny bears

250
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,125
to match the TVs?

251
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:21,708
No? Okay, maybe not!

252
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:23,500
Sculptures might
really be hard to market

253
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,083
because, since they're
carved one at a time,

254
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,708
they're kind of expensive.

255
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:27,875
Yeah, that's true.

256
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,750
The ones we were looking
at were not cheap.

257
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,458
And can't be mass produced.

258
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,291
It's rough to make a living
from wood-carving alone, too.

259
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:36,250
So finding people
to carry on the tradition

260
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,875
can be a big problem.

261
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,166
But there are younger
people like the students

262
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,875
we just met, right?
So they are around.

263
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,291
Yes, but apparently, it's a
pretty hard path to follow.

264
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,125
A lot of people will
start out as pupils

265
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,500
and quit before
they've finished.

266
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,083
[YOSHINO]
Hey, come on, you guys!

267
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,000
We've barely even
started this meeting,

268
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,458
and there hasn't been a
single positive comment!

269
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,500
You're right.

270
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,166
Even if the current
market is a bit weak,

271
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,208
I'm sure we can find
a way to revive it!

272
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,916
Wow, somebody's gung-ho.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,708
You in love with
that older sculptor guy?

274
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,541
That's not what this is!

275
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,166
But we're similar because
we both moved to Manoyama

276
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,541
and we're working hard
to make things happen here.

277
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,208
So I want to support them.

278
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,000
You know the old saying.

279
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,500
"We learn from the past."

280
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,333
But it's also time for some
innovation around here!

281
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,666
[TATSUO] There's apparently
a new plan in place

282
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,583
to rejuvenate the town using
Manoyama Wood Carving.

283
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,750
The queen has been
really excited about it!

284
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,208
We're hoping that our woodwork

285
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,000
will become popular
all over the country--

286
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,458
Don't let yourself get caught up

287
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,666
in the tourism
board's foolishness.

288
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,125
You should try to remember,

289
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,291
our wood carving has been named
a traditional art form.

290
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,250
So show some pride.

291
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
[YOSHINO sighs]

292
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,833
My brain is completely fried.

293
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,541
Yeah, same.

294
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:11,416
[SHIORI] Brainstorming sure
takes a lot of energy, huh?

295
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I think our idea about
the wooden katanas

296
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,708
is the most realistic.

297
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,083
[YOSHINO]
I also like the Chupakabura

298
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,541
with a <i>kabura</i> in its mouth.

299
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,333
Especially the fact
that it's thin.

300
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,708
Are you still on that?

301
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,333
Ooh, a new drink!

302
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,375
[SANAE]
Wait, doesn't that have--

303
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,000
A little alcohol
might just get those

304
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,833
creative juices flowing,
you know?

305
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,541
[RIRIKO]
Mokele-mbembe.

306
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,750
[SANAE] I told you,
nobody knows what that is!

307
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:34,541
[YOSHINO]
Doku!

308
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,166
Oh, the queen!

309
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,083
Tell me, what'd you think
of the Hercules 2.0?

310
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,375
Great! It was actually
super helpful!

311
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,666
I loved being able
to lift such heavy stuff!

312
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,583
Well, personally,
I'd like to see it used

313
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,708
for some kind of
agricultural work,

314
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,916
but the older people
have a hard time accepting

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,291
change and progress.

316
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:52,500
Makes sense.

317
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,583
Also, it felt kind of
stiff or something.

318
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,500
Could be harder for
an older person to use it.

319
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:58,375
Hmm...

320
00:13:58,458 --> 00:13:59,500
Oh, that's it!

321
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,541
[TATSUO] Carvings on
a powered exoskeleton?

322
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,458
That's right!

323
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,916
Just like this, see?

324
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,208
Well, the sketch leaves
something to be desired, but--

325
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,750
Hey, now!

326
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,166
Basically, it's the same as
putting a case on a smartphone.

327
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Wrapping it up inside
a pretty package.

328
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,750
A true collaboration
between modern,

329
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,041
cutting-edge technology
and traditional art!

330
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:22,833
Cool, huh?

331
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:23,958
[clattering]

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,250
[TATSUO]
Ah...

333
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,791
Um, let's--let's take our
conversation outside.

334
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:32,625
Sorry about that.

335
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,625
Kazushi really can't
stand this kind of thing.

336
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,666
Uh... But I think
it's fascinating!

337
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,125
No way, do you really?

338
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,250
Yeah!

339
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,458
I'd love to help out
in any way I can!

340
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,166
Thank you so much for that!

341
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,041
Planting rice using
an exoskeleton

342
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:49,208
with wood carvings attached
is pretty darn unique, huh?

343
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,083
All we need is a
little news coverage,

344
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,708
then we'll get a
bunch of tourists,

345
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,375
and they'll all buy sculptures
as souvenirs! Voilà!

346
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,750
But what about Kazushi?

347
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,500
Won't he be upset
at you for forging ahead

348
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,875
without his input?

349
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,500
The thing is, that guy
always follows his own path.

350
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,791
If his work is interfered with,

351
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,541
then yeah,
he'll probably get angry.

352
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,041
But I don't think he'll
have much of anything

353
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,166
to say about what we're doing.

354
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,500
I know he may seem
a little eccentric to you,

355
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,416
but seriously, Kazushi's
carvings are just incredible.

356
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,875
They're on par with
the work you see here.

357
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,208
I can't even begin to compete.

358
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,416
So I'll follow my own path, too.

359
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,708
I'll use our ancient art form
to unite the old with the new.

360
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,958
[SHIORI'S DAD chuckles]

361
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,416
It's like I'm wearing
the special effects

362
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,541
on a hero show!

363
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,166
Yes, honey, you're very cool.

364
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,041
You never told me that
your family ran a farm!

365
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,708
It's more of a hobby, really.

366
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:45,041
Battle mode has been activated.

367
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
That should do it.

368
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:47,666
Try moving around a little.

369
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:50,291
[SHIORI'S DAD chuckles]

370
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,666
[SHIORI]
You got it, Dad!

371
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,166
Wow! It's so light! Look!

372
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,041
[laughing]

373
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,916
Gosh darn it!

374
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,958
[gasping]

375
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,083
[SHIORI]
Oh, no, catch it!

376
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:07,875
[TATSUO]
With what?

377
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,041
[SHIORI]
Here, use this!

378
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,916
It did look cool for a minute.

379
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,583
It just wasn't very
practical, that's all.

380
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,166
Shiori, I'm sorry.

381
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,291
Oh, no worries!

382
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,583
My dad really loved it!

383
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,000
He said he had a great time!

384
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,000
I do truly believe we
were on the right track,

385
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,375
though, you know?

386
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,125
Melding tradition with more
modern-day technology.

387
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,916
Oh, that's it, right there!

388
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,166
What's "it"?

389
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,750
We can combine
that transforming

00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,750
vending machine
at Doku's workshop

391
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,875
with wooden carvings
of a Buddha!

392
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,291
Oh, yeah!

393
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,083
That sounds like a blast, man!

394
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,791
I was just working
on a new drink

395
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,291
for the vending machine
so maybe you

396
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,750
can be my guinea pigs.

397
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,208
This here is Kabura Sushi Soda!

398
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,250
With two percent
<i>kabura</i> sushi extract!

399
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,041
Couldn't you just put
something normal in it?

400
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,083
[DOKUSHIMA]
All right, bring her down slow.

401
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:58,041
[TATSUO]
Okay!

402
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,916
[DOKUSHIMA, TATSUO grunt]

403
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,708
[YOSHINO]
It's perfect!

404
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,000
[DOKUSHIMA]
There it is.

405
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,416
Hey, why don't you
go give it a test run?

406
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,291
[ROBOT 4A]
Welcome!

407
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,333
[GROUP gasps]

408
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,500
Amazing!

409
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:21,416
This idea might actually work.

410
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,333
Everyone will be
talking about it!

411
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,083
People will come from all over!

412
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,416
Just to see our Buddha!

413
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,833
[KAZUSHI]
Are you joking?!

414
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,500
Come on Tatsuo, not you, too.
What the hell is this?

415
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,416
What did you think
you were doing, old man?

416
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,750
This is blasphemy!

417
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,333
[USHIMATSU]
What? I think it's unique.

418
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,791
How is it blasphemous?

419
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,750
Manoyama Wood Carving is
a traditional art form!

420
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,125
And as such it is protected
by the government!

421
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,000
Why don't you think
about it for a minute?

422
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:51,166
One of the conditions
for traditional art forms

423
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,875
is that they're
a viable industry.

424
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,541
At this rate it won't
be long before its

425
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:57,125
protected status as a
national art form is revoked.

426
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,208
Is that so?

427
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,250
Don't you have a
single ounce of pride?

428
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,833
[USHIMATSU] You can't make
a living from pride!

429
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,958
You idiot! That's precisely
what we've been doing!

430
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,500
I think you've mistaken
being proud for being loud!

431
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,416
Please, that's quite enough.

432
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,833
--What?
--I'm sorry.

433
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,250
This is completely our fault.

434
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:14,000
"Too wise to woo peaceably."

435
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,583
--[USHIMATSU] Say what?
--[CHITOSE] What?

436
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,375
It's from Shakespeare.

437
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,791
It's about lovers.

438
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,708
We're not lovers!

439
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,041
[door opens]

440
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,708
How'd it go?

441
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,375
He said it doesn't matter what
the Board of Merchants says.

442
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,041
We can continue the project
under his authority.

443
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,541
I can't decide if that
feels right or not though.

444
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,041
What's up? You ladies
get in trouble again?

445
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:42,791
What the hell?

446
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,791
Kabura Sushi Soda.

447
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,708
[TAKAMIZAWA]
How can you serve this stuff?

448
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,791
I just had a
disturbing thought.

449
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:53,041
In the end, was what we did just
like turning sushi into soda?

450
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,541
I have to go back.

451
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,625
I want to apologize
one more time.

452
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,458
[SANAE]
I'm so truly sorry.

453
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,041
But I hope you do
understand one thing--

454
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,041
that our efforts were
absolutely sincere.

455
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:16,000
We think Manoyama
wood carving is wonderful.

456
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,375
That's why we want
to promote it.

457
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,208
And as outsiders, we want
to give back to the town.

458
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,291
Just the same as you and Tatsuo.

459
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,666
All right, why don't you tell me
why you came to Manoyama?

460
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,208
Because...

461
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,166
I wanted to be
surrounded by nature,

462
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,833
and I wanted to be my own boss.

463
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,416
You sure you weren't
simply running away

464
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,875
from something difficult?

465
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,375
Running anywhere, am I right?
Didn't matter where.

466
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,458
I don't care to be
lectured by someone

467
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:45,000
who came here as an escape.

468
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,416
I chose to come to this
place with a purpose.

469
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,375
Unlike you two.

470
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,791
I'm sorry, but I don't
think that's fair at all!

471
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,041
Yoshino...

472
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,541
We've been working
really hard on this idea.

473
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,250
We've racked our brains
trying to think of ways

474
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,875
to get people excited
about Manoyama Wood Carving--

475
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:01,125
Sorry, but nobody
asked you to do that.

476
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,916
Let me ask you something.

477
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,375
What type of wood do you
think that is over there?

478
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,041
No idea, right?

479
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,541
And yet you assume
you're qualified

480
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,666
to talk about
Manoyama Wood Carving?

481
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,916
What a joke.

482
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,208
Thanks for trying back there.

483
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,583
But I think he
might've been right

484
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:32,000
about my running away
just to escape.

485
00:20:33,166 --> 00:20:34,416
[YOSHINO]
What do you mean?

486
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,041
[SANAE]
In Tokyo, I worked overtime

487
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,708
late into the evening
every single day.

488
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,875
I'd stumble, exhausted, onto
the last train of the night,

489
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,250
only to squish myself back
on it the next morning

490
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,833
with everyone else.

491
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,458
On my days off, I was so spent

492
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,875
that I would just
stay in bed all day.

493
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:57,208
I got very sick and had
to check in to the hospital.

494
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,583
I went back too soon.

495
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,083
I thought things would
fall apart if I didn't.

496
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,333
Missed deadlines
and angry clients.

497
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,000
Those seemed like the end
of the world back then.

498
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,291
It was so silly, though.

499
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,291
I forced myself
to leave the hospital,

500
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,833
but someone had
been covering for me,

501
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,708
so everything was fine.

502
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:17,041
There was no reason
to rush back like that.

503
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,250
And that's when
I finally realized...

504
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,041
It doesn't always have to be me.

505
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:27,041
The world is perfectly
capable of turning on its own,

506
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,958
with or without my help.

507
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:32,041
Everything suddenly
seemed so ridiculous.

508
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,083
So do you see?

509
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,250
That's why I can't argue
with someone like Kazushi.

510
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,083
There's nobody to take
his place--he's the only one.

511
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,375
The only one that
can do that job.

512
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,041
But that doesn't mean--

513
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,875
[SANAE]
I can't do this anymore.

514
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,875
I shouldn't be involved if
I have no purpose

515
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,500
and I'm not putting
my heart into it.

516
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,500
You are!

517
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,958
You've been so invested in it!

518
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,041
[SANAE]
I'm sorry.

519
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,416
I know you're
determined to see this

520
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,583
through to the end, Yoshino.

521
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:01,750
But I can't.

522
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,083
I can't anymore.

523
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,083
[SANDAL] When life is hard
and you're feeling down,

524
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,166
take a deep breath,
and look up at the sky.

525
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,416
[SANDAL] Next time:
"The Budding Yggdrasil."
