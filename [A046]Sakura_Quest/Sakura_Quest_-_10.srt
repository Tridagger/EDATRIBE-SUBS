00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,708
Okay! Why don't I
give you a ride?

170
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,291
Thanks, but the buses
are still running.

171
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,250
Would you accept the invitation
if I offered you a ride?

172
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:35,833
[RIRIKO]
I...

173
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,125
It's no problem at all,
and I'd like to, Rii- <i>chan</i> .

174
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,250
Good night, then!

See you tomorrow!

[KINU]
So, I'm curious.

178
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,625
Why don't you want to
do the Manoyama Dance

179
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,083
with the other girls?

180
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,291
Mainly because I don't
like being told I have to

181
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,750
do something just because
of some tradition.

182
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,708
[KINU giggles] You sound
just like my husband.

183
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,083
[RIRIKO]
Uh?

184
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,041
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

185
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:02,041
I imagine it doesn't make
you happy to hear it.

186
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,458
But, you see, I mean
it as a compliment.

187
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,666
I like that you aren't
afraid to be an individual.

188
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:12,416
[KINU]
Okay, hop on in.

189
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:18,875
Good night. I'm heading out now.

Alright, good night.

191
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,625
[RIRIKO]
I'm home.

192
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,208
Well, hello there.

193
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:27,166
I'm guessing Shi must have
given you a ride home?

194
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,125
So you're helping out
with the Community Club's

195

matchmaking tour. I feel sorry
for them because there's

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,458
no way that's going to go well.

197
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,666
[RIRIKO] Grandma, do you
think I've changed?

[CHITOSE]
Hm?

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,416
Why, has something
happened with you?

200
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,416
You're still Ririko.

201
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,083
And you're perfect
just the way you are.

[YOSHINO]
What do you think?

203
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,791
Did I maybe say something
I shouldn't have?

204
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,458
No, and as long as you don't try
to force her to dance with us,

205
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,125
I think it'll be fine.

206
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,791
You and Rii- <i>chan</i>
have been pretty close

207
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,291
since you were
little girls, right?

208

[SHIORI]
Mm-hm!

209
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,583
We've been friends since we
started elementary school.

210
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,750
I wonder if Chitose
got angry with her

211
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,958
when she didn't end up
learning the Manoyama Dance.

212
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,625
She seems like she'd be
strict about that stuff.

213
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,125
I know it's hard to believe,

214
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,625
but granny Chitose is
pretty soft on Rii- <i>chan</i> .

215
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,125
[YOSHINO]
Is she really?

216
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,833
If she wasn't, she probably
wouldn't allow Rii- <i>chan</i>

217
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,208
to do half the things
she does with us.

218
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,250
It's a bunny, you see?

219
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,083
It's cute!

Is it something
you can eat?

No, not anymore.

a very long time now.

animal expert, Rii- <i>chan</i> !
