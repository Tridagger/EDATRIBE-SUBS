1
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,791
[CHIHIRO] I've gotta
help her somehow.

2
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,625
[BABU meows]

3
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:02,958
I have to do whatever
I can to preserve Rea's body.

4
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,625
[BABU meows]

5
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,708
Sweet dreams, Rea.

6
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,791
[CHIHIRO sighs]

7
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,375
[REA giggles]

8
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,583
Rigor mortis has already
begun to take hold of her body.

9
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,375
If this keeps up,
it won't be long

10
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:17,125
before she's been
eaten by decay.

11
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,375
First thing I need to do,

12
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,833
is figure out how
to maintain her body,

13
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,500
starting with reversing
the effects of the rigor mortis.

14
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,458
[birds tweeting]

15
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,833
[gong dinging]

16
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,000
[MERO] A book explaining
how to preserve a body?

17
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,166
[CHIHIRO] Yeah.

18
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,250
I remember seeing you read one.

19
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:52,166
I kinda need to
urgently borrow it.

20
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,375
Oh.

21
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,875
You must be talking
about the medical book

22
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,833
on various methods of embalming.

23
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,416
I don't have it,
I loaned it out to a classmate.

24
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,875
One of your classmates?

25
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,958
What kind of
middle schooler is this?

26
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,291
One who is currently between
elementary and high school.

27
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,208
Yeah, thanks for
breaking that down for me.

28
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:11,250
Maybe I should be asking
what you need such a book for.

29
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,416
Uh, just uh...

30
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,083
The usual reasons.

31
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,166
You know what, never mind.

32
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,708
[door slides open and shut]

33
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,500
What's up with him?

34
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,625
He's been acting weird.

35
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:31,833
[CHIHIRO writing
with permanent marker]

36
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:33,583
I don't think it
should be too hard

37
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,708
to get my hands
on some formaldehyde.

38
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,333
But I've heard it gives off

39
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:40,250
a really powerful,
really awful stench.

40
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,875
[CHIHIRO sniffs]

41
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,458
So the smell
would make it tough

42
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,333
to hide her from my family.

43
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,250
The way she is right now,

44
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,041
she just looks
like she's sleeping.

45
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,416
Alright, kids,
it's getting pretty late.

46
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,750
You've gotten
enough sleep, get up.

47
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,916
Uh, yeah, one more minute!

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,416
I can't just leave her
out in the open like this.

49
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
I guess that's my only option.

50
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,083
There.

51
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:31,625
Y'know.

52
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,166
This situation is making it
kinda tough to be a gentleman.

53
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,000
Ow.

54
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,375
[CHIHIRO gasps]

55
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,041
[CHIHIRO heart beating]

56
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,291
C'mon, Chihiro,
what's going on up there?

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,958
[CHIHIRO] Aw man,
this sucks.

58
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,500
I'm on my way, okay?

59
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,875
I know it's
a little uncomfortable,

60
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,083
but the stiffness should
be gone by this evening.

61
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,625
I'm sorry it's
so cramped in here,

62
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,416
but we've gotta try
to keep you out of sight.

63
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,208
Okay?

64
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:36,791
[REA's stomach gurgles]

65
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,666
Geez.

66
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,583
What the hell was that noise?

67
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,000
Your stomach?

68
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,791
It's been a while
since you've eaten.

69
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,666
You must be hungry, huh?

70
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,708
Well, uh...

71
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,708
We've gotta get
you moving first.

72
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,958
But as soon as you can,
I'll get you something to eat.

73
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,541
I'm comin' down now, Dad!

74
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,708
[hands clapping]

75
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,375
We're thankful for this meal.

76
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,500
[CHIHIRO] Thank you
for all the grub.

77
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,000
[JOGORO] Thanks for
the green stuff.

78
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,750
[CHIHIRO] Our usual
breakfast routine.

79
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,833
What's the big deal?

80
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,375
Why'd you put all these fish
eyeballs in the miso soup Do'on?

81
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,833
Now calm down, Dad,
that's nothing but tofu.

82
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,875
[JOGORO yells]

83
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,333
[CHIHIRO]
It's the same as always.

84
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:33,291
Despite the undead girl
in my room.

85
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,958
I want to experience life.

86
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:42,250
To do things other girls
do that I haven't yet.

87
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,333
Hey Mero, what would
you consider "normal"?

88
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,375
Could you phrase that
question in even broader terms?

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,458
Right. Just forget I asked.

90
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,708
Alright, which one of you put
fish eyeballs in the miso soup?

91
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,625
Seriously Dad,
that's just tofu.

92
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,458
[RANKO] Thank you.

93
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,000
Have a nice day.

94
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
This is bad.

95
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,791
I can't believe
she's gone missing.

96
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,416
Oh hey, Ranko!

97
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,666
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

98
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,833
Really?

99
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,958
You're the one
surprised to see me?

100
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,208
So what brings you here?

101
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,875
Do you know the Sankas?

102
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,625
I was making a delivery.

103
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,541
Should I ask why you were hiding
out in their bushes or what?

104
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,583
I was just trying
to check on my friend.

105
00:09:45,666 --> 00:09:47,666
Their daughter Rea
is one of my classmates

106
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,583
and she didn't
show up at school today.

107
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,875
I was worried something
bad might've happened to her.

108
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,125
So I just wanted
to see if she's okay.

109
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,125
From the bushes?

110
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:59,000
What, are you allergic
to front doors or something?

111
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:03,250
Why don't you just
go ask them how she is?

112
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,125
No way, I can't do that!

113
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,416
Rea is like the most
popular girl in our class!

114
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,333
I mean, as far as
the entire school goes,

115
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,666
you're definitely more
popular but in our class.

116
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,791
well, you know, she's--

117
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,750
[RANKO] It's cool.
No need to explain.

118
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,583
[HELEN] It's strange.

119
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:23,250
I can't quite
put my finger on it,

120
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,750
but something about
Rea has been off lately.

121
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,583
I mean, she's still just
as awesome as she's always been,

122
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:32,125
but she seemed kinda
sad the last few days.

123
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,125
And this was
an unexcused absence!

124
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:40,000
It just feels like
there's something really wrong.

125
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,833
[RANKO] Ya don't say.

126
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,833
[HELEN] She may not seem
like a big deal to you,

127
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:45,333
since she's just a freshman,

128
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,375
but trust me,
she's pretty incredible, Ranko.

129
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,125
I can't think of
a single person in our class

130
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,208
who doesn't wanna
be her best friend.

131
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,625
And she treats
everyone like they are.

132
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,708
Here!

133
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,958
Just look at some
of these pictures.

134
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,083
Wait, hold on.

135
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,458
I've got so many of
'em in here, let's see.

136
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,083
Wow, it's like she's incapable
of taking a bad picture,

137
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,875
but I'll show you my favorite.

138
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,416
Amazing, huh?

139
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,333
She just looks so beautiful and
approachable in this picture.

140
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,958
This one's a pretty good
shot of the three of us.

141
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,416
And this one's
a runner-up for my favorite.

142
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,000
I couldn't really get close
enough to the house to tell

143
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,125
but it kinda looked to
me like her family's maids

144
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,291
were freaking out
about something.

145
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,583
I don't know.

146
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,166
How'd it look on the inside?

147
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,791
[RANKO] Well, there was
definitely a commotion.

148
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,083
[HELEN] What do
think is going on?

149
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,750
Now I'm really worried.

150
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,583
Do you suppose something
could have happened to her?

151
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:42,583
Ranko! I was talking to you!

152
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,250
Geez.

153
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,166
[CHIHIRO] No school today!

154
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,791
That's right, I've got
the whole day to hang out

155
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:55,750
with my family,
and clean the temple.

156
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,541
This really sucks.

157
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,875
Doesn't Dad know
there are bigger things

158
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,416
I could be dealing
with right now?

159
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,291
So, Chihiro.

160
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,583
I couldn't help but notice

161
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,458
there's been another
cat hanging around lately.

162
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,375
Wouldn't you rather
take a little more time

163
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,458
to properly mourn
Babu's passing?

164
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,041
Geez, it's not like that, Dad.

165
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,333
Babu's returned
from the dead, that's all.

166
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,708
Well, denial is
a stage of grief.

167
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,625
Hey, Grandpa,
you saw Babu, right?

168
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,166
Sure, I saw him.

169
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,041
It was unmistakably Babu.

170
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,166
Ya hear that?

171
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,666
Grandpa Jogoro can
back me up on this.

172
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,666
[JOGORO laughing]

173
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,708
[CHIHIRO laughing]

174
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,875
That's right, it's true!

175
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,875
Dadu and my Sada have
both returned from the dead!

176
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah, y'see,
Dadu and Sada have--

177
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,083
Hey, wait a minute,
who's Sada?

178
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,083
And it's Babu, not Dadu!

179
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:57,208
[MERO] Nobody told me
dementia was contagious.

180
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:59,583
The reanimation potion I made

181
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:01,750
deserves to be recognized
throughout the world!

182
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,083
Yeah, you're right!

183
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,750
Your reanima--Huh?

184
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,250
Whoa, wait, Grandpa.

185
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,375
Can you repeat
what you just said?

186
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,416
Well, sure.

187
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,625
"Throughout the world."

188
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,625
No, before that!

189
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,166
Repeat the entire sentence!

190
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,583
The reanimation potion?

191
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,000
Are you trying to tell
me that you know about it?

192
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,875
Wait, does this
mean you're the one who...

193
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,250
Quit putting words in my mouth!

194
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,291
I didn't!

195
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,541
Yes, you did!

196
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:29,708
Doesn't sound like me.

197
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,208
I'm gonna take a bath.

198
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,000
What?

199
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,958
Hey, hold on!

200
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,750
[DO'ON] Alright, I admire
the creative excuse.

201
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,583
But you're not getting
out of cleaning that easily.

202
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,125
[MERO] For shame,
Brother. For shame.

203
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,125
[CHIHIRO] Fine, sorry.

204
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,750
[BABU yawns]

205
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,291
[CHIHIRO] Okay,
let's sort this

206
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,916
out. Grandpa obviously
knows something

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,791
about the reanimation potion.

208
00:13:57,875 --> 00:13:58,958
And knowing him,

209
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,166
he's definitely
capable of creating it.

210
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,791
If that's the case,
he's gotta know a method

211
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,375
for staving off
the decomposition process.

212
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,666
A way to preserve Rea.

213
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,958
[MERO] Hey, Brother?
[CHIHIRO yelps]

214
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,708
[CHIHIRO] Don't sneak up on me!

215
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,125
[MERO] Something occurred to me.

216
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,416
It's been a matter of weeks

217
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,041
since your room was
last cleaned properly.

218
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,375
As always.

219
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,458
I figured I would offer
to clean it for you later.

220
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,875
[CHIHIRO] Uh, yeah, thanks.

221
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,333
Wait, Mero, not so fast!

222
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,375
I'll do it myself.

223
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,333
You've already got
enough cleaning to do.

224
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,000
[MERO] I am officially
worried about you now.

225
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,375
[CHIHIRO] Uh, no, no.

226
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,333
I just...

227
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,583
I know it sounds weird,

228
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,041
but I've actually
started to enjoy cleaning.

229
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,416
Crazy, huh?

230
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,125
I just never realized
how much fun it was before.

231
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:47,541
So, really...

232
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,791
I got it.

233
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,666
[CHIHIRO laughing]

234
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,708
[MERO] Alright,
I'm not gonna argue.

235
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,875
Weirder every day.

236
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,000
[RANKO] Someone
call for delivery?

237
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,500
[CHIHIRO] Ugh, not you again.

238
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,583
[DO'ON] Oh, look, it's Ranko.

239
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,833
[CHIHIRO] Why are you here?

240
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,166
This is two days in a row.

241
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,875
I was in the neighborhood
making a delivery

242
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,458
and thought I'd stop by.

243
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,083
I brought some
lunch for you guys.

244
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,875
That's one less
meal to cook today.

245
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,750
Indeed.

246
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,958
Thank you, Lady Ranko.

247
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,750
Your generosity
is quite remarkable.

248
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,041
And somewhat rare.

249
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,750
This one's too busy
thinking about zombie movies.

250
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,041
He could learn
a thing or two from you.

251
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,708
But with the time
it would take him to learn,

252
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:33,458
you might as well marry him.

253
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,958
Oh c'mon, don't
tease him that way!

254
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,000
There's no way he'd
ever land a girl like me!

255
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:42,625
[RANKO] Oh yeah,
I almost forgot.

256
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,333
Did you hear
the news, Chihiro?

257
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:46,416
I doubt it.

258
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,791
I've been here all day.

259
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,625
That girl Rea you
were asking about?

260
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,250
Well, apparently, she ran
away from home yesterday.

261
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:54,833
Really?

262
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,208
Well, I'll be.

263
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:57,541
[CHIHIRO] Weird, huh?

264
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,416
Her family are
customers of ours,

265
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,833
so this is first hand info.

266
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,250
I dropped off a delivery earlier

267
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,291
and their house
was complete chaos.

268
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,416
I guess rich girls have their
share of problems, too, huh?

269
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,083
Uh... Guess so.

270
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,708
Or maybe.

271
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,916
Maybe she was forbidden
from seeing her one true love

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,666
and they decided
to elope together

273
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,458
in an act of defiant romance!

274
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,083
Well that's a positive spin.

275
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,291
Unlikely though.

276
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,708
Picture it!

277
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:23,750
The two of them alone
together in a small guest room

278
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,791
with a view of the sea.

279
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,750
They were destined
to live separate lives,

280
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,416
but chose to fight it.

281
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,708
They refused to
accept their destiny.

282
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,333
Determined to share
their love forever.

283
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,541
Y'know.

284
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,291
I just realized
she could've run away

285
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,666
to come live with you, Chihiro.

286
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,666
Huh?

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,958
It does make sense.

288
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,208
That creepy friend of yours

289
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,750
said you were spending
a lot of time with her.

290
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,708
Be honest, you're her
star-crossed lover, aren't you?

291
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,916
How many times do
I have to explain this?

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,583
I happened to bump
into her one night

293
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,166
while I was walking around town.

294
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,708
We had, like,
maybe 20 minutes

295
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,625
of polite conversation, if that.

296
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,208
Geez, what's with
the interrogation;

297
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:12,458
why do you care who I talk to?

298
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,041
I'm practically
your older sister.

299
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,541
It's only natural I'm concerned

300
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,541
with the type of people
you associate with.

301
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,583
No, it's not natural,
but I hardly know the girl.

302
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:21,583
Alright.

303
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,083
Fine, I believe you.

304
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,500
Well I've gotta get home to help
out, so I'll see ya later.

305
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:28,416
Don't go and do anything stupid.

306
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,875
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

307
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,750
Somebody's in a real mood today.

308
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,166
[DO'ON] Hey, Chihiro!

309
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,166
Don't forget you've still
gotta scrub out back, too!

310
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,458
Yeah, I know, Dad, I remember!

311
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,041
Hey, wait a minute.

312
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:43,458
I'm already here, I might as
well borrow another zombie DVD.

313
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,166
She said Rea's home
was a total mess.

314
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,958
Well, their daughter did die,

315
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,416
come back to life,
and then run away.

316
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,625
I doubt that's the kind of thing
parents take lightly.

317
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,666
Anybody in here? Nope.

318
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,416
Holy crap, it's cold in here!

319
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,791
You can't be serious.

320
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,291
He's running
the air conditioning

321
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,083
in the middle of the day?

322
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,875
Hmm, let's see, there's gotta
be a few I haven't borrowed yet.

323
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,208
They really don't get very
creative with the titles,

324
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,250
they all kinda sound the same.

325
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,333
Maybe this one?

326
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,166
What?

327
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,500
Why's it in the wrong case?

328
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,291
[BABU meows]

329
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,541
Eeny meeny miney moe,
pick a zombie by the toe.

330
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,541
If it's rotten and falls off.

331
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,000
Why can't I decide
on a damn movie?

332
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,208
Geez.

333
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,750
I keep picking
the ones I've already seen.

334
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,916
Why's there a long
black hair in here?

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,625
This can't be Chihiro's,
it's way too long.

336
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
Wait.

337
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,541
[RANKO gasps]

338
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,291
I felt like
I was being watched.

339
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,958
Oh yeah, I totally forgot
about Rea being hungry earlier.

340
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:32,291
I wonder what food
is good for an upset stomach.

341
00:19:32,375 --> 00:19:35,291
But if she's a zombie,
does she eat?

342
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,166
No way, that's just fiction.

343
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,250
Whoa.

344
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,333
What's going on?

345
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,708
Who the hell are you?

346
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,958
That hurts!

347
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,708
Are you a freakin'
body builder?

348
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,666
Hold on!

349
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,958
I know who you are.

350
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,375
You're Rea Sanka, aren't you?

351
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,708
What are you--?

352
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,041
Stop!

353
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,041
Do you hear me?

354
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:15,125
[RANKO yells]
Get off of me!

355
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,166
Enough already!

356
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,916
Are you okay?

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,625
Were you in
an accident or something?

358
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,041
Your smile is creeping me out!

359
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,708
Let me up and
I'll call an ambulance!

360
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,250
There's something...
Not right...

361
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,083
Wait... No.

362
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,583
There's no way.

363
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,166
[RANKO gasps]

364
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,208
[RANKO yells]

365
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,875
Sounds like Wanko.

366
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,541
Oh crap.

367
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,916
Please just let her
have seen a spider!

368
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Even a tarantula!

369
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,458
Hey Wanko!

370
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,208
Are you... Okay?

371
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,833
[RANKO moaning]

372
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,041
I guess this means
she's past the rigor mortis.

373
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,750
Hey!

374
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,833
What the--?

375
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,708
What's up with her?

376
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:36,291
It's kind of a long story.

377
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,208
Chihiro.

378
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,583
Just stay calm.

379
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,708
[RANKO screams]

380
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,583
[BABU meows]

381
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,333
[MERO] A ratings stunt?

382
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,875
This whole show
strikes me as a ratings stunt,

383
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:06,458
pandering to people's
base desires and blood lusts.

384
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:10,458
So what is this ratings stunt?

385
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,208
It's gratuitous nudity,
isn't it?

386
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,750
Next time on Sankarea,

387
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:18,000
Episode 6, "It's because I...
Ran into You."

388
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,375
Who can guess which famous

389
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,833
zombie movie director
inspired my name?

390
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,458
I'll give you a hint,
his first name is George!

391
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,875
That's right, George Romero!
