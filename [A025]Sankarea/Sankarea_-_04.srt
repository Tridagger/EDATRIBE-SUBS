[SITUJI] Dear God,
how could this happen?

00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,791
Master Dan'ichiro, sir?

4
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:41,958
[DAN'ICHIRO] Rea?

5
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:45,041
Rea!

6
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:47,500
[SITUJI] Master!

7
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,750
[DAN'ICHIRO] I can't
believe you're alive.

8
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,500
I was worried
I'd lost you forever.

You're drenched in blood.

00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:58,583

13
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:03,125
Is something wrong?

14
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:05,375
Rea... I can't seem
to find your pulse.

because I no longer have one.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,583
I died but I've been reborn.

19
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:17,125
[DAN'ICHIRO] What is
that supposed to mean?

20
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,375
Wait!

21
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,791
You can't just
walk away from me.

You're my beloved daughter!

00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,166
[REA] Not anymore.

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,625
Now that I've been reborn,

25
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,916
I'm not the daughter
you once held dear.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,875
No amount of pleading
can bring me back to you

It's not possible.

[MAIDS] Did you hear the rumor?

33
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:24,333
Which one?

34
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,541
Apparently, the reason
Miss Rea's been sneaking out

35
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,375
each night is to
meet up with a boy!

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,916
Yeah, yeah, that's old news.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,583
I've got the latest
if you wanna hear it.

38
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,416
Yeah, of course
we do, Natsukawa.

39
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,333
One of the other maids told me
Miss Rea ran away from home.

40
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,750
She did?

41
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,750

care to elaborate?

Good afternoon,
Madam Aria.

46
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,500
Start explaining
before I lose my temper.

47
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,041
Yes, ma'am.

48
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,708
One of the other maids told
me she heard Master Dan'ichiro

49
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:57,041
say Miss Rea wouldn't
be coming home again.

50
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:57,791
Where is he?

51
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,708
As soon as he walked in,

52
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,000
he went straight
for the bathroom

53
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,750
and he's been
in there ever since.

54
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,958
In the bathroom?

55
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,583
Out of my way!

56

Last time I checked,
you get paid to work,

00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,083
not stand around and gossip.

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,750
Middle of the day and
she already reeks of booze.

00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,000
That's where she's been going?

00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,208
Can't say I blame her,

64
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,583
Master Dan'ichiro
practically ignores her

65
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,833
so she probably enjoys
the attention, you know?

What's this I hear
about Rea running away?

She fell off a cliff and died,
but she got back up again.

70
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,833
What?

71
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,875
I watched her die,

72
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,833
and I watched her get up
and walk away from me.

73
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,125
What is with you?

74
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,500
Look.

75
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,291
If word got out our daughter
ran off, I'd be ruined.

76
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,833
I could lose my position
as Sanka Academy's chairman.

77
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:00,500
Well?

78
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,458
Do you have any
idea where she went?

79
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,833
[SITUJI] Madam.

80
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,875
Though I don't know
her exact location,

81
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,500
I would venture to guess
she's with the Furuya boy.

82
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,875
And who's that?

83
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,500
Never heard the name before.

84
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,958
He's... the one.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,291
She chose him over me.

86
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:25,541
He is the wretched boy
who seduced my little girl.

87
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,666
None of this would've happened
if it weren't for him!

to the likes of you!

until my beloved daughter

has returned to me!

93
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,083
[CHIHIRO] One of
the more unique courses

94
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,791
at Sanka Private Girls' Academy
is "Meditative Needlework."

95
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,208
Before their
first period class,

96
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,541
students sit quietly
for ten minutes

97
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,250
as they pass a needle
through a piece of cloth.

98
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,458
School officials claim

99
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,458
it's a beneficial form
of mental gymnastics

100
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,625
and therefore require
that it be done every day.

101
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:03,958
I guess if nothing else,

102
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,625
it teaches the
girls basic sewing

103
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:07,750
and the value of meditation.

104
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,458
[REA] It's relaxing.

105
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,916
I used to get up early

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
so I could do "meditative
needlework" before school.

107
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,041
I've done it every morning

108
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,333
since I was just a little girl.

109
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,666

I was wondering how you
were so calm about this.

111
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,250
Bet you never
thought you'd use

112
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,625
your skills to sew up
your own skin, huh?

113
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,625
Ugh, that's so gross!

114
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:28,291
Sorry but I need
you to hold it closed.

115
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:31,583
It shouldn't take
me much longer, okay?

completely sunk in yet,

So why in the hell
are you so happy?

124

I'm sorry.

home and get something sweet?

pastries in the window.

I know she can't go home

but I hope she doesn't think
she's staying here tonight.

There's only so much
temptation a man can take.

You think you're
pretty slick, don't you?

152
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,708
I wasn't looking!

00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,958
I swear I wasn't!

spotted Babu in a tree.

[CHIHIRO] Yep, that's him.

158
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,625
Good grief.

159
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,291
What the heck is he doing
all the way up there?

His eyes aren't cloudy
like they were before.

165
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,041
Is it just me or does
it sound like he might

00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,166
be suffering from
a case of the sniffles?

167
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,833
No, I named him Babu
because of that weird meow.

168
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:59,166
When I first took him in
I was worried he might be sick

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,750
but the vet assured me
he was perfectly healthy.

170
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,750
That's just the way he meows.

171
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,541
Aw, the poor little guy.

172
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,333
I can't believe I was so worried

173
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,875

Are you telling me you
understand what my cat's saying?

179
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,833
Well, not word-for-word,
but I get the general idea.

180
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,708
Right, Babu?

181
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,833
[CHIHIRO thinking] Apparently,
zombies have the ability

182
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:30,750
to communicate
regardless of their species.

183
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,375
I find it interesting
that their transformation

184
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,958
hasn't seemed to affect
their personalities at all.

185
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,458
Is something on your mind?

186
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,458
Well, yeah,
but it's nothing, really.

187
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,166
Ah.

188
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,083
Bet I know what it is.

189
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,583
You're disappointed I don't
act more like the zombies

190
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:51,333
you've seen in
the movies, aren't you?

191
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:56,458
"Brains" I'm not very good
at this but you get the idea.

192
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,500
[REA giggles]

193
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:01,541
As if I didn't find
her hot enough as it is.

194
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,333
I don't understand how
you can be so lighthearted

195
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,958
about becoming a zombie.

196
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,583
I mean, doesn't
it make you anxious?

197
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,166
Of course.

198
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,166
At the same time, I feel better
knowing you'll take care of me.

199
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:24,458
Lemme ask you something,

200
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,291
when you say I'm going
to "take care" of you,

201
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,625
what do you mean by that?

202
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,708
What exactly do
you want me to do?

203
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,791
I'm almost afraid to hear
what her answer's gonna be.

204
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,666
I don't know guess
I hadn't thought about that.

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd like for us to
go shopping together.

206
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:41,083
Maybe take a trip to the museum?

207
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,625
Huh?

208
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,875
And I would love for you to
show me some more zombie movies!

209
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,916
I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,750
Oh yeah, I want to go
to the amusement park!

211
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,125
And the summertime
festivals, too!

212
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,208
If I didn't know any better,

213
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,125
I'd think she's
looking for a boyfriend.

214
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm so sorry,

215
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,000
it sounds like a lot
but it's really quite simple.

216
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,958
I just want to experience life.

217
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,625
Do things other girls
do that I haven't yet.

218
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,958
Lemme get this straight,

219
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,250
you wanna have the same
experiences as normal girls

220
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,625
even though you're a zombie?

221
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,791
Yeah!

222
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,000
Is there some reason I can't?

223
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,958
If there is, please tell me!

224
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,958
No, that shouldn't be a problem.

225
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,500
I just wanted to clarify.

226
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,875
Holy crap is she strong.

227
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,458
[CHIHIRO's heart beating]

228
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,208
Oh, Chihiro.

229
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,583
I don't know.

230
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:34,125
What's come over me.

231
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,083
Are you sure about this?

232
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
[CHIHIRO'S heart beats faster]

233
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,916
[RANKO] Where are you, loser?

234
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,875
Chihiro!

235
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,583
Get your ass out here!

236
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,416
Aw crap, what
does she want?

237
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,041
I'm surprised you're brave
enough to show your face

238
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,000
after you ditched
me this morning!

239
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,375
Do you have someone
in your room, you perv?

240
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,375
No, I'm all alone
up here, I swear!

241
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,291
Then it's okay
for me to join you?

242
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,458
I didn't say that!

243
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:09,541
Just wait there
and I'll come out!

244
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:10,833
Why can't I come in?

245
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,791
'Cause you might see
something you don't wanna see.

246
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:16,083
It's not like finding your porn
stash is gonna scar me for life.

247
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,833
You wanna bet?

248
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,916
Fine, I'll wait here.

249
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,708
I'm gonna see what she wants

250
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,083
but don't leave this
room while I'm gone.

251
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,458
I'll make it quick.

252
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,583
All right, if you wanna talk,
follow me down to the riverbed!

253
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,375
What the hell?

254
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,875
Why can't we talk here?

255
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,750
Because I don't want my family
to hear your filthy mouth.

256
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,833
Now come on, let's go!

257
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:46,458
I'm so confused, what was
I about to do to Chihiro?

258
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,291
I don't know what came over me.

259
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,208
What is this strange feeling?

260
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,625
Sorry, I didn't
mean to ditch you.

261
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,333
How was I supposed
to know you were stuck?

262
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,666
How did you not
hear me calling you?

263
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,083
All I could think about
at school was kicking your ass!

264
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,458
Geez!

265
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,833
I said I was sorry!

266
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,916
Well, did you ever find Babu?

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,666
Yeah, he hasn't
attacked anyone yet

268
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,375
so I guess he's
gonna be okay.

269
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,458
Good grief.

270
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:22,125
I don't get why you
refuse to carry a cell phone.

271
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,458
It certainly would've
come in handy this morning.

272
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,583
I don't have enough
friends to need a cell.

273
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,416
What's gonna happen to Babu
now that he's become a zombie?

274
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,708
Do you think he's immortal?

275
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,208
Huh.

276
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,333
That's a really good question.

277
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,333
Hey!

278
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,333
Furuya!

279
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,583
What's up, Yasutaka?

280
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:45,166
Why are you glaring at me?

281
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,500
Damn you, Furuya!

282
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,000
You betrayed me!

283
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,291
Why didn't you tell me
you're friends with Rea?

284
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:56,750
Teach me your ways!

285
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,083
How'd you convince
a hot chick like her

286
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,125
to hang out
with a chump like you?

287
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,791
What kind of mojo
did you work on her?

288
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,041
Boys are weird.

289
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,083
Yeah, Yasutaka's
been in rare form today.

290
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,291
Excuse me.

291
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you happen to be
talking about Rea Sanka?

292
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,333
Yeah, she's the only
Rea that matters in my book.

293
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,500
If you know her why
did you ask me about her?

294
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,500
I'm not sure what you're
trying to pull here Chihiro,

295
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:17,250
but I don't like it one bit!

296
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,750
Geez, she's barely
an acquaintance.

297
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,291
What's wrong with you guys?

298
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,250
Gimme a break!

299
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:22,666
Look, I couldn't
care less about

300
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,166
whatever's going
on between you two.

301
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,125
I just wanna know how
you landed such a hottie!

302
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,250
Well, that's a relief.

303
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,541
At least now we
know he's interested

304
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,166
in more than just zombie girls.

305
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,458
Not true, dude.

306
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,458
They're the only
females who do it for me.

307
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,541
There's no way I'd be interested
in a girl who's not a...

308
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,208
What's the matter?

309
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,000
Wow, it just hit me.

310
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,625
Now that Rea's a zombie,
she's basically my dream girl.

311
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,541
And she's sitting in my bedroom
right now waiting for me.

312
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,416
Talk about living
out your fantasies.

313
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,833
My life suddenly
got much more awesome.

314
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,541
The heck are you smiling about?

315
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,208
Don't be silly,
I'm not smiling.

316
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,583
What's taking so long?

317
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,000
It's getting pretty late.

318
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,500
I wonder how
Chihiro knows that girl.

319
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,000
She was wearing
a Sanka Academy uniform.

320
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,458
I know he said he didn't
have a girlfriend but...

321
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,291
C'mon, it's not
like finding your porn stash

322
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,000
is gonna scar me for life.

323
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,166
It's so quiet.

324
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,541
Guess I can leave
his room if nobody's home.

325
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,083
I should've asked
Chihiro if it's okay

326
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,708
for zombies to take a shower.

327
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,625
But what could it hurt?

328
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,916
I don't know why, but this
feels different than it used to.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,541
Oh, I know.

330
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:26,958
It's because I can't feel

331
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:29,250
the temperature of
the water anymore.

332
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,250
Ah.

333
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,125
Still nice though.

334
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,958
I didn't know they
built bathrooms this small.

335
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,375
but I think it's kinda cute.

336
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,250
Well, this thingy's
weird looking.

337
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,791
I wonder what you use it for.

338
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,916
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it.

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,500
I think maybe you use it
like this to do exercises with.

340
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,166
Where did he come from?

341
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,750
I thought nobody was home!

342
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:11,958
My dear Sada!

343
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:12,791
Is it really you?

344
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, how I've missed you!

345
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:15,208
I never imagined
you'd come back

346
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,708
from the dead and return to me!

347
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,583
I'm not Sada!

348
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,458
Let go!

349
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:19,583
I know it was my fault,

350
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:20,958
but I hope you can
learn to forgive me!

351
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,541
You've got the wrong person,
now please let go of me!

352
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,458
Is anybody home?

353
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,916
Sada!

354
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,958
What has gotten
into you, Grandpa?

355
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:41,958
My precious Sada
came back to life!

356
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,416
It seems our bond
of love is so strong

357
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,958
that not even death
could keep her away from me!

358
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:48,541
If that was true
you'd be in big trouble.

359
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,708
Grandma wouldn't
like hearing you

360
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:52,166
call her Sada when
her name was Kiyo.

361
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,625
I dunno.

362
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,125
Name doesn't ring a bell.

363
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,166
Hang on...

364
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,666
what was I doing just now?

365
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
Oh, for Pete's sake.

366
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,166
Thank goodness I got
away from him when I did.

367
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:12,333
If I were home, I'd be sitting
at the dinner table with Father.

368
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:14,958
But I'm in someone else's home.

369
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,291
Not only that,
I'm sitting in a boy's bedroom

370
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,833
in nothing but a towel.

371
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:29,583
It's hard to believe how much
has happened in just one day.

372
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,250
I'll admit, it's a little scary.

373
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,166
I couldn't be happier
because I'm free.

374
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:41,166
But most of all, I don't have
to suffer my father's abuse.

375
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,041
Ever again.

376
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,333
That took a lot longer
than I expected.

377
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:55,583
I don't think I've ever met

378
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,916
anyone with as much
energy as Yasutaka.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,458
If only I could
convince him to use it

380
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:03,208
for something productive
instead of always pestering me.

381
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,708
Welcome home, Brother.

382
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,625
For dinner, we'll be
having a delicious stew

383
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,083
made from the innards
of various animals.

384
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,666
I'm gonna have to pass.

385
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,541
I don't have
much of an appetite.

386
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,333
I'm surprised
Mero hasn't found her yet.

387
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,875
I'm back.

388
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,250
Hey.

389
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,583
Chihiro, you're back.

390
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,041
Do you wanna explain why you're
wearing nothing but a towel?

391
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:35,708
I'm sorry, it's because I took
a shower while nobody was home.

392
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,750
Yeah, I figured.

393
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,708
You're still soaking wet.

394
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,166
You're gonna catch a cold.

395
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,500
Nah.

396
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,375
You don't have
to worry about me.

397
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:47,500
After all, zombies don't
catch colds the way people do.

398
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,916
I guess you're right.

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,458
Wait a second, it just hit me!

400
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,250
The conversation
we're having right now.

401
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,000
It's the same kind
of loveable banter

402
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:58,208
I've always fantasized about
having with a zombie girl!

403
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:02,458
So how are you keeping up, Rea?

404
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,291
Your stomach's not bothering
you or anything, is it?

405
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:08,083
I don't feel any pain.

406
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,625
Bud I guess that's only
normal for a zombie, huh?

407
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,666
I can't take it!

408
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,458
This is too much!

409
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,166
Is there
something wrong, Chihiro?

410
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,041
Nothing at all!

411
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,500
Just trying to keep
myself in check now

412
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,666
that all of my wildest
dreams are coming true.

413
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,791
It'd be easier for me
if you'd put some clothes on.

414
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:29,875
Yeah.

415
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:32,000
I'd love to, but...

416
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,250
I'm afraid I'm not
really able to do much

417
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,125
of anything,
other than lay here.

418
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,666
I don't know what's wrong.

419
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,000
All of a sudden by body got
stiff and I couldn't move.

420
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,791
Is that why your
speech is slurred?

421
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,416
I just thought you were talking
funny because I woke you up.

422
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,125
No, it's because I can't move.

423
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,166
How could this happen?

424
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,500
Is the reanimation
potion wearing off?

425
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
I need to check something.

426
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:06,208
They won't budge, which means.

427
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,583
Rigor mortis is setting in.

428
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,625
Rigor mortis?
Never heard of dat.

429
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,125
Oh. It's not a big deal.

430
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,166
Just a natural phenomenon.

431
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,041
There's nothing to worry about.

432
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,416
Chihiro, you're so smart.

433
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,416
That makes me feel better.

434
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,583
Thanks for taking care of me.

435
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,666
Yeah, sure.

436
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,166
Rea's so full of life
I forget she's dead.

437
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,500
Her body's deteriorating.

438
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,083
It's a good thing
she can't feel pain

439
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,083
'cause I bet
it'd be excruciating.

440
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,833
Thank you, Chihiro.

441
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:43,416
I've got to find
a way to slow down

442
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,250
the decomposition process

443
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,125
before her flesh starts to rot.

444
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,625
Otherwise,
she'll be nothing more

445
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,958
than a skeleton
within a few months.

446
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,333
I can't let that happen.

447
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,166
I just want to experience life.

448
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,625
Do things other girls
do that I haven't yet.

449
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,541
I have to do whatever I can.

450
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:22,666
To preserve Rea's body.

451
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:02,208
Let me get this straight,
you want me to "dial it back"?

452
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,250
What do you mean by that?

453
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:06,375
My read doesn't
fit the character?

454
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,541
Do you realize
how ridiculous that sounds?

455
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,750
Hello, I am the character.

456
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,541
Next time on Sankarea,

457
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,583
Episode 5, "If She's
a Zombie... That Means..."

458
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,000
Tune in to see Mero!

459
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,458
I'm in this for the long haul,
and I'm not gonna let

460
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,125
your less than constructive
criticism break me down.
