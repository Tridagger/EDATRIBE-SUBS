1
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:37,458
There is evil lurking in the
shadows of this world--

2
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:41,541
in the form of beings
called Crimson Denizens.

3
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:45,333
They've come from an adjacent
world, the Crimson Realm,

4
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,250
to collect precious power
of existence from the humans.

5
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:53,166
They slip into day-to-day life.

6
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,833
Then they slowly
begin to devour that life.

7
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,916
However, none of the humans

8
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,041
ever seem to notice
what's happening.

9
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,041
Thanks.

10
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,708
Next up, Sakai!

11
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,791
Yes sir!

12
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,000
Father came back from Tokyo
and told us about the sights--

13
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,791
Hey Sakai... what's up?!

14
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,166
Hey Ike.
What's up?

15
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,166
I thought you had to stay
after for cleaning duty?

16
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,500
Nah, I got someone
to cover for me.

17
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:37,333
I have a mock exam
at cram school today.

18
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,750
Jeez, man.

19
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,750
You're already
prepping for college?

20
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,125
I've gotta do what I can
to keep my parents happy,

21
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,791
otherwise my allowance
ends up suffering.

22
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,416
So... What're you up to?

23
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,541
I don't have any plans
so I guess I'll go down to

24
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:51,708
the station and check
out the new CD releases.

25
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,333
Have fun.

26
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,458
So Sakai is the guy you're
crushing on, right Kazumi?

27
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,791
How'd you know that?

28
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,166
We've been friends forever.

29
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,666
I can totally tell you like him!

30
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,708
No, I mean, it's just--

31
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,333
You don't have
to hide it from me.

32
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:14,000
You know, if you really are
interested in Sakai then we

33
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,583
might be able to
help each other out.

34
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,416
Huh?

35
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,541
I don't understand--how so?

36
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:25,375
C'mon, Kazumi,
this is your chance!

37
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,875
I guess I can't depend
on her to be much help.

38
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,083
I'll just have to work
it out on my own.

39
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,416
I got this!

40
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,458
Hello.

41
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:54,125
So, what's up?

42
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey, where is Ike any way--
why isn't he with you?

43
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,833
He had to go to cram school
for some kinda mock exam.

44
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:00,791
Why'd you ask?

45
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,083
No reason.

46
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,416
It's just you guys
are always together.

47
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,541
It's not like we're attached
at the hip or anything.

48
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,791
I know this is out of the
blue but I was wondering if

49
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:11,875
you knew whether or
not Ike has a steady girlfriend.

50
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,625
Well, no I don't
think that he does.

51
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,750
Oh, okay.

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,291
I gotta go by the station
so I guess I'll see you later.

53
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,083
Cool.

54
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:25,666
See ya later!

55
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,500
I get it.

56
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,791
She's got a crush on Ike.

57
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,708
Don't run!
You'll spill your soda!

58
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,666
Be careful, kid!

59
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,333
What the--What's going on?

60
00:06:58,958 --> 00:06:59,583
Whoa.

61
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:01,208
Everyone's frozen!

62
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
Okay!

63
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,208
The preparations are complete!

64
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,750
There aren't that
many humans here

65
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,250
but I suppose it'll
be enough to suffice.

66
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,333
Time to dig in.

67
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,750
Yummy!

68
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,375
Delicious!

69
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,916
They're so tasty!

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,916
You should know better than
to talk with your mouth full!

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,291
Mind your manners, young lady!

72
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:37,416
Yes, ma'am.

73
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,500
What-- no!
Hirai!

74
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,916
Who the hell is this kid?

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,083
I'm not sure,

76
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,083
but he's definitely not
a Crimson Denizen.

77
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:58,250
But if not then why's he able
to move around inside the Seal?

78
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,000
He must be a Mystes!

79
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,541
What's a Mystes?

80
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,291
You mean one of those Torches
that has a treasure inside?

81
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,833
That's right and
this one is very special.

82
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,583
We haven't brought the master
any souvenirs in a while.

83
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,708
This one should make him happy.

84
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,708
Yay!

85
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,750
We got a present for the master!

86
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,875
I got ya!

87
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,166
It's time to eat!

88
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,458
Who did that?!

89
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,416
Who is this girl?

90
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,250
So what do you think, Alastor?

91
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,541
I don't think they're
Crimson Denizens.

92
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,625
It appears they're just Rinne.

93
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,833
That pendant just talked!

94
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,125
How dare you cut off my hand!

95
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll crush you!

96
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,750
No, please, don't!

97
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,041
Looks like that body was
nothing more than a shell.

98
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,833
It must have escaped
at the last second.

99
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,916
Well, it's gotta be
around here somewhere.

100
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,500
That's a Mystes, isn't it?

101
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:06,666
Yes.

102
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,333
And it seems to be
a unique one at that.

103
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,625
Who're you?

104
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,166
What are you doing?!

105
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,291
She hit me.

106
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,500
I've been cut.

107
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,333
You must be the Flaming Haired
and Blazing Eyed Hunter.

108
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,458
You're the Flame Haze
who's contracted to Alastor,

109
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,166
the Flame of Heaven.

110
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,166
Yep, that's me.

111
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,458
What're you gonna do about it?

112
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,000
My master will
be livid when he finds

113
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,416
out you've ruined our plans.

114
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,791
I'm not too worried.

115
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,958
He's going to be taking his
last breath very soon.

116
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,250
Damn you.

117
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,791
But first things first.

118
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,333
You'll breathe your last
breath before I go for his.

119
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,333
Look.... that must
be its true form!

120
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,666
Behind you!

121
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,708
I shouldn't have
let it get away.

122
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,625
Judging from the way those
Rinne were talking there's

123
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,583
someone powerful behind this.

124
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,333
There's only one
way to find out.

125
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,375
We'll have to hunt
down their Crimson Lord.

126
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,250
But before we do that.

127
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,958
Please help me!

128
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:36,958
It hurts!

129
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,708
Can you call an
ambulance for me?!

130
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,958
Shut up!
Shut up!

131
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,458
Shut up, you big crybaby!

132
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,833
Would you quit your whining
and get over it already?!

133
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,291
You're so cruel.

134
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,083
Be careful, you don't want
to see her when she's angry.

135
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,500
Look, if you were
human you would

136
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,166
have already died
from that wound.

137
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,833
"If I was human"?!

138
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:55,791
I've got to hurry and
try to stop all the bleeding!

139
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,666
Please help me!

140
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,958
I'm not bleeding.

141
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,708
What is this?!

142
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,500
Is this some kind of dream?!

143
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,583
I'm on fire!

144
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,083
Get it off!

145
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:19,708
What the hell's going on?!

146
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,541
It's time to rebuild.

147
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,416
Hirai!

148
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,000
She's come back.

149
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,416
Oh, thank goodness.

150
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,375
That should about do
it for the Torches.

151
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,416
I'll use a couple
to rebuild the city.

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,750
That's fine.

153
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,541
I still can't believe
how much those Rinne ate.

154
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,916
I guess their
master must require

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,958
a lot of power of existence.

156
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,041
Okay.
All done.

157
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,791
No one even noticed
what happened.

158
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,708
How's that possible?

159
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,708
Wait up, Hirai!

160
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,750
I'll walk you home!

161
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:29,791
What is that?

162
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,708
It looks like a flame.

163
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,250
Hirai.

164
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,583
He's gone.

165
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,500
Where'd he go?

166
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,458
No way!

167
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:56,375
Hey!
Hold on a minute!

168
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,333
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?!

169
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,916
That little boy just
disappeared into thin air!

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,375
And I can see this
blue flame burning inside--

171
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,125
Would you just shut up already?!

172
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:07,291
Alastor how should
I dispose of it?

173
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,250
You can't be serious!

174
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,583
We mustn't destroy a Mystes.

175
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,125
That would be careless.

176
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,625
I know that's normally the case
but this one's a major pain.

177
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:16,791
Why don't you just
tell it the truth?

178
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,000
That should be
enough to shut it up.

179
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
Why do you keep talking about me

180
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,375
like I'm some
kind object or thing?

181
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:26,125
Because you are no
longer a human being.

182
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,083
You ARE a thing.

183
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,833
The creatures I fought
back there are called Rinne.

184
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,375
They're basically the lackeys
of Crimson Denizens.

185
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:45,750
They come to this
world to collect

186
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:48,125
power of existence,
a type of energy.

187
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,083
They do that by eating humans.

188
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,958
Once a human is eaten by a
Rinne their life is terminated,

189
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,416
they simply cease to exist.

190
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,833
That's right.

191
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,083
And if too many humans
disappear at once it throws off

192
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,083
the world's balance so we
place Torches to fill the void.

193
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,375
What's a Torch?

194
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,291
The remnants of the
person who's been killed.

195
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,041
Like you--you're a Torch.

196
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,833
The real you was
killed so now all that's

197
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,541
left are the remnants
of your existence.

198
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,750
But that's impossible.

199
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,083
Look for yourself.

200
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,500
You can see your
own flame, can't you?

201
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,375
Don't worry;
you're not the only one.

202
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,458
Anybody who has that blue
flame is a Torch just like you.

203
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,041
They're placeholders
for the people

204
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,541
whose existence has
been eaten by Rinne.

205
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:47,666
Since they're only
temporary replacements,

206
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,208
their flame will
start to dim and

207
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:52,250
then when it burns out
completely, they'll disappear.

208
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,250
What?

209
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,166
They will leave this world.

210
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,500
And that's my explanation.

211
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,291
But does that mean
I'm already dead?

212
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,791
Hey, wait!

213
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:15,583
Why do you insist
on following me?

214
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,791
I'm not following you.

215
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,375
I live on this
side of the bridge.

216
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,791
Right.

217
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,458
I can't believe I'm dead.

218
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,458
Yuji Sakai is no
longer alive and

219
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,958
I'm just the shell that's left.

220
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,791
Damn it... I just can't wrap
my head around it.

221
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,083
Can I ask you something?

222
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:43,708
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

223
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,333
I've answered enough questions!

224
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,458
Are you a human being?!

225
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,541
Tell me!

226
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,500
No I'm not--I'm a Flame Haze.

227
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:51,083
A Fl--what?

228
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,666
I am a Flame Haze.

229
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,791
I hunt Crimson Denizens
who've killed humans

230
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,083
to consume their
power of existence ok?

231
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,458
She replaces those
killed with a Torch

232
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,583
so the world remains in balance.

233
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:04,875
Without Flame Hazes, Crimson
Denizens would run rampant

234
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:09,166
killing even more
humans than they do now.

235
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,000
So you're a Flame Haze.

236
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:18,458
I am so sorry that
I failed you, Master.

237
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:22,291
I never meant to cause you to
lose one of your favorite Rinne.

238
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,291
There's no need for you
to apologize, Marianne.

239
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,875
It wasn't your fault.

240
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,083
The two of you were up against a
particularly strong Flame Haze.

241
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:32,916
I should thank you for
finding a Mystes for me.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,958
That's a fantastic prize
you've found, my dear.

243
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,458
But I didn't bring it back;
I let it get away.

244
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,208
If you'll give me
another chance I'll

245
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,541
hunt down that
Mystes for you, Master.

246
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,916
While I have no doubt that
you would, it isn't necessary.

247
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,875
We mustn't rush into this.

248
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:53,208
We must think it through
and act carefully my dear.

249
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,208
We can't afford to be
reckless when dealing

250
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,375
with the Flame of
Heaven's Flame Haze.

251
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,041
Yes, Master.

252
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,541
Marianne.

253
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,750
Look at the Crystal Altar.

254
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,750
Isn't it beautiful?

255
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,208
It's absolutely breathtaking.

256
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,833
Let's enjoy this moment.

257
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,458
We should cherish
our time together and

258
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:22,291
not worry about
that silly Flame Haze.

259
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:32,666
Yuji!

260
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,583
Your breakfast is ready!

261
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:36,541
I'll be down in a sec.

262
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,041
As a mother, I want
the best for my family...

263
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:41,750
That's why I shop at
the Misaki City Market...

264
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,416
I was starting to get worried.

265
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,791
It's not like you to sleep in.

266
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,291
And yesterday you went straight
to bed as soon as you got home.

267
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,708
Is there something wrong?

268
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,500
No, I just had a rough day.

269
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,291
You're looking at a close-up
of the Gobi Desert

270
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,791
in the middle of a sandstorm--

271
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,458
let's see if we can
get a closer look!

272
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,083
Oh wow, the Gobi Desert?

273
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,041
That's where your
father is right now.

274
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,666
Wouldn't it be funny
if we saw him on TV?

275
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,125
Yeah.

276
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,541
Well, Mom seems to be fine.

277
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,208
I was worried she
might be a Torch too.

278
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,500
I wonder how she and Dad would

279
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,458
feel if they found
out that I'm really dead?

280
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,833
I guess it would feel like
they never had a child.

281
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,375
It's better that they
forget I ever existed.

282
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,708
Then they won't
end up being hurt.

283
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,625
It's still so hard to believe
that I'm not alive anymore.

284
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,250
I'm not even the
real Yuji Sakai.

285
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,250
Yuji.

286
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,291
Are you sure everything's okay?

287
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,458
Yeah, everything's
just fine, Mom.

288
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:48,833
I'd better go.

289
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,250
My homeroom teacher
will write me up if I'm late.

290
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,541
Thanks for breakfast.

291
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,791
I'll see you tonight.

292
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,125
Have a good day!

293
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,750
I feel bad lying to her

294
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,458
but if I told her the
truth she'd be upset.

295
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,875
If I'm just a place holder
for the real Yuji Sakai

296
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,916
then why do I have to deal
with all these emotions?

297
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,666
I don't get it.

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,333
What are you doing here?

299
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,791
The Crimson Denizens are
going to come looking for you.

300
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:20,250
I figured I should probably keep
an eye on you in the meantime.

301
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,625
Sorry, pal.

302
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,333
But that's what happens
when you're a unique Torch.

303
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,458
Don't worry;
I'll watch out for you.

304
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,000
Thanks.

305
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,375
I remember that Rinne thing
called me a Mystes yesterday.

306
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:35,666
What's that mean?

307
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,583
Impressive, you
have quite a memory.

308
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,083
Okay, how do I put this?

309
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,666
A Mystes is a special kind of
Torch-- one that carries a

310
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,458
Treasure Tool within it that was
created by a Crimson Denizen.

311
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,500
Do what?

312
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,916
You heard me.

313
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,875
Whenever a Mystes' flame
burns out that Treasure Tool

314
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,916
is transferred to a new Torch--
creating a new Mystes.

315
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
The best way to describe

316
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,416
it is it's like a moving
treasure chest.

317
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,666
But why's it in me?

318
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,125
How the heck should I know?!

319
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,916
Like I said, these treasures
move from Torch to Torch.

320
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The enemy will likely
come looking for you

321
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,333
before your flame burns
out so they can reclaim it.

322
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,958
Before my flame burns out.

323
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,458
Hey.

324
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:13,875
How can you be
so sure that I'm dead?

325
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,833
You're a Torch and a Mystes.

326
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:17,500
But I still have
the same thoughts and

327
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,375
emotions that I
did when I was alive.

328
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,041
'Cause you're his remnants
that were left behind.

329
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,875
That makes sense.

330
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
This city is strange.

331
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,291
I've never seen so
many Torches in one place.

332
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,625
It is rather odd, isn't it?

333
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,125
Why does that matter?

334
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,666
Hirai!

335
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,416
Her flame, it's so weak.

336
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,333
Yeah, it doesn't
have much time left.

337
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,333
But why?!

338
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,958
She was just
attacked yesterday?!

339
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,458
Those Rinne were
on a rampage yesterday.

340
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,875
They must've eaten most
of her power of existence.

341
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,625
Hirai!

342
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
Hey Hirai!

343
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,458
Good morning!

344
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,583
Do you mind if I walk with you?

345
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't mind.

346
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,875
What's happened to her?

347
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,916
She's so different now.

348
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,416
It probably won't even
make it through the day.

349
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
It's not right.

350
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,250
Isn't there anything we can do?

351
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,125
'Fraid not.

352
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,875
That's all that's left of her.

353
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,541
You know she's dead, right?

354
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,166
That can't be.

355
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,958
She can't disappear.

356
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,583
Hurry up Hirai,
you don't wanna be late!

357
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:37,958
What do you say we run for it?

358
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,666
Come on!

359
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
What's its deal?

360
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,666
It's worried about its friend

361
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,833
but never thought to
try and save itself.

362
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,125
Finding yourself in
someone else's shoes

363
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:50,916
can sometimes change
your perspective.

364
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,833
Hirai can't disappear.

365
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,625
I won't let that happen!

366
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,916
Do you know if Ike
has a steady girlfriend?

367
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,541
Ah, Mr. Sakai.

368
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,250
I've warned you
about your tardiness.

369
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,708
Right?

370
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:13,833
I'm sorry, sir.

371
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,833
'Nother tardy for Sakai.

372
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,041
Um, sir.

373
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,208
What about Hirai?

374
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,541
Oh, thank you.

375
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,958
I didn't see her come in.

376
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,500
Go ahead and
take your seats, you two.

377
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:28,458
You better watch out;
he'll give you detention.

378
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,750
Yeah.

379
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:39,541
No one's even looking at Hirai--
it's like she's not here.

380
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,333
Time for lunch, care to join?

381
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,541
I guess so.

382
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,375
What do you say?

383
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:52,416
Can she join us?

384
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Yeah, I guess so.

385
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,041
Cool?

386
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,458
Hey guess what?

387
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:06,750
Remember that crazy teacher at
my cram school I told you about?

388
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:09,333
Turns out he's
Murata's older brother.

389
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,666
That's weird.

390
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,666
Do you have to go back
again after school today?

391
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,041
No, I've got the evening off.

392
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:14,916
Okay... Then how about
when we got outta school

393
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,708
we head into town and hang out?

394
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,333
Hirai could come with us.

395
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,625
C'mon, you think
you're up for it?

396
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,666
Uh... Sure.

397
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,875
Well, this should be fun.

398
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:25,625
See? I told you he'd
want to come along.

399
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:33,875
Move in a little closer, Ike.

400
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,750
Say cheese!

401
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,666
That looks pretty good, huh?

402
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,416
I guess I'm kind of in the way.

403
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,583
I'm sorry about that, Hirai.

404
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,833
Dude, you're being weird.

405
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:47,250
What do you guys
want to do next?

406
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,666
Try to win a stuffed animal?

407
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,250
Why don't you play a fighting
game against each other?

408
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:55,583
Hey Ike, can
you entertain Hirai?

409
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,875
I've gotta take
care of something.

410
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:58,875
Wait a sec.

411
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,583
Sakai!

412
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,416
Quit moving around so much!

413
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,583
I can't keep up!

414
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,833
And just for the record,
no matter how much

415
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:26,041
you sympathize with it,
it's just a Torch.

416
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,666
You can't stop it
from disappearing.

417
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,750
I know, but I'm trying
to keep everyone

418
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:31,166
from forgetting about her.

419
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,000
It won't work.

420
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,458
I have to try!

421
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,666
What is with that Torch?

422
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,750
I've never met one so dumb.

423
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,666
Indeed.

424
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,708
Hey, Ike, where's Hirai?

425
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:46,416
Wha?

426
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,166
Who's this Hirai person?

427
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,791
She was just here
with you a second ago.

428
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,208
Are you sure about that?

429
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,208
Yeah, I know for a fact.

430
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,166
She didn't already
disappear, did she?

431
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,541
Oh, wait.

432
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,250
Now, I remember her--
she must have left already.

433
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,375
Are you sure?
Did she say anything to you?

434
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,458
Don't think so.

435
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,583
Hey! Did I just
beat the whole game?!

436
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:07,625
I don't care if you
beat the stupid game, Ike--

437
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:08,708
would you listen to me?

438
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,125
Did she say where she was going?

439
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:13,125
The three of us were
here, hanging out together,

440
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,500
Hirai was with us!

441
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,125
Do you remember?!

442
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,833
Do you know whether or not
Ike has a steady girlfriend?

443
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:22,166
What's up?

444
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,500
You've been really
high-strung lately.

445
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,333
What's going on with you?

446
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,666
I shouldn't be mad at him.

447
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,416
This is what happens
to a Torch-- people forget.

448
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:34,125
He's been acting so weird.

449
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,041
Please Hirai,
don't disappear just yet!

450
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,666
I'm on my way.
Wait for me!

451
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,125
Stupid Torch.

452
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:46,833
I thought I told it
to stay in one place.

453
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,041
Here you are.

454
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,291
I've been looking for you.

455
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,916
Ike said sorry he had to go but
he has stuff to take care of.

456
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,750
Hey, look.

457
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,333
If you just cut me
out you'll have a

458
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,708
nice picture of the two of you.

459
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,458
Wait.
What did you say?

460
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,375
I've always liked the view here.

461
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,250
It's so pretty.

462
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:30,541
Yeah, it is.

463
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:32,625
I see why you
wanted to come here.

464
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,000
Hirai.

465
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,041
What do you say we bring Ike
here with us tomorrow?

466
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,958
That way you can spend
some more time with him,

467
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,875
so you can't disappear
before then, okay?!

468
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,375
Goodbye, Hirai.

469
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,666
Do you understand now?

470
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,750
That is the fate of a Torch.

471
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,666
There's no way to
stop it from happening.

472
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:22,708
What's left of their flame
will inevitably burn out.

473
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,916
And nobody will remember
that they ever existed.

474
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,291
They disappear without a trace.

475
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,583
You're wrong!

476
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,125
You're wrong.

477
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,208
Because I will remember her!

478
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,958
I know she existed and that
she had a crush on Ike!

479
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:39,791
Her name was Yukari Hirai!

480
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,625
And I will never forget her.

481
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,333
I swear!

482
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,875
I know she existed.

483
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,208
And so what?

484
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,125
I know that I exist, too.

485
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:54,166
Whether you recognize it or not,
I know that I am Yuji Sakai.

486
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:56,791
No, you're nothing but a Torch.

487
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,375
But deep down
I'm still Yuji Sakai.

488
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:01,208
I exist and so do you!

489
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,875
I am nothing more
than a Flame Haze.

490
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:03,875
That is all.

491
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,708
In a way,
I'm similar to a Torch.

492
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:08,333
There has to be more to you
than just being a Flame Haze.

493
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,916
No, I'm afraid there's not.

494
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,958
Because you are just a Torch,
and I'm just a Flame Haze, okay?

495
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:14,791
That's not true!

496
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,000
It is-- so deal.

497
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:17,708
It can't be!

498
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,375
What?

499
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,916
What's your name?

500
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,291
Would you please tell
me your name?

501
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:34,291
I don't have a name,
'cause I'm just a Flame Haze.

502
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,500
You've gotta have a name.

503
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,416
Would you just shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

504
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,041
I don't need a stupid name!

505
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,375
If I need to be distinguished
from other Flame Hazes

506
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,791
for some reason,
then they just call me

507
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,500
'the one with Nietono no Shana'.

508
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,125
Nietono no Shana?

509
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,875
That is the name
of the sword she carries.

510
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,208
Nietono no Shana.

511
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,208
Okay, then your name
is gonna be Shana.

512
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,125
I'll call you that from now on.

513
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,333
Your name is now Shana,

514
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,250
so you're not just
a Flame Haze anymore.

515
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,291
And I'm not just a Torch either.

516
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,333
I'm Yuji Sakai

517
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,833
You can't just give
me a name like that.

518
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,791
Kazumi!
Your bath is ready!

519
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,500
Okay!

520
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,666
I'm going to take those
cookies to Sakai tomorrow.

521
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,375
But I hope he doesn't think I'm
too forward and freak out.

522
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:24,666
I'll ask Yukari what
she thinks I should do.

523
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,083
Sakai, what's up?
You look weird, dude.

524
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:43,208
Ike, who's that?

525
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:47,458
Jeez, dude, what is
with you--that's Hirai.

526
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:48,458
That's Hirai?

527
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,500
You sure about that?

528
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:50,750
Hey, Ike!

529
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,250
I need the answers
to last night's homework.

530
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,750
Be right there.

531
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:57,083
Y'know I'm starting to get
really worried about you, man.

532
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,625
Wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

533
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,666
I already told you.

534
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,166
I have to keep
a close eye on you.

535
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,375
But you didn't have
to follow me to school.

536
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,500
And why are you sitting
in Hirai's seat anyway?

537
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,916
Because I am Yukari Hirai.

538
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:16,458
I have taken over her existence
therefore I am her now.

539
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,916
What do you mean?
How' do you even do that?

540
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,875
I caught a remnant of
her as she was disappearing.

541
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,833
But you don't
even look like her.

542
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:28,333
Hi Yukari!

543
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,458
Good morning.

544
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,500
Oh hey, Sakai.

545
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,458
I hope you have
a good morning, too.

546
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,333
Uh.

547
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,916
Same to you.

548
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,250
I did it.

549
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,833
That's crazy.

550
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,833
Yoshida was close friends with
Hirai, and she didn't notice.

551
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,041
Taking over someone's
existence doesn't mean

552
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,750
that I'm trying to
be that person--

553
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,083
in fact, it's the opposite.

554
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,291
I've actually changed
the perspective of others'

555
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:53,916
so that when they think of
Yukari Hirai they see me.

556
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,625
How could you?

557
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,833
You're a lifesaver, Hirai!

558
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:59,708
Thanks again for letting
me borrow your notes.

559
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,166
Yep.

560
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,958
This isn't right.

561
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:12,083
I know who the real Yukari
Hirai is and it's not her.

562
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:16,000
Good morning, Shana.

563
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,166
It appears the
Flame Haze is keeping

564
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,458
a close watch on that Mystes.

565
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,791
Yes...

566
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:33,625
She must suspect that
we will come back for it.

567
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,708
And her suspicion
would be correct.

568
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:37,666
It's only a matter of time.

569
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,208
I guess we should
make an appearance--

570
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,500
I wouldn't want to
disappoint the Flame Haze.

571
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,416
And I'm determined
to get my hands on

572
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
the Treasure Tool
within that Mystes.

573
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:50,083
Please, won't you let me take
care of this for you, Master?

574
00:33:50,166 --> 00:33:53,208
I want to make up
for failing you last time.

575
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,166
If you insist.

576
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,416
Be careful.You mustn't
underestimate the

577
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,000
Flaming Haired-Blazing
Eyed Hunter.

578
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,750
Here, take this with you.

579
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,083
Remember not to wander
too far away from me.

580
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,583
I can do whatever I want.

581
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,958
Hey, Yukari.

582
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:22,208
So would you like to walk
home together today?

583
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,458
There's something
I wanted to ask you--

584
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,916
I can't.
I've got other plans.

585
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,625
I understand.

586
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,583
I'll leave you alone.

587
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,666
Yukari must be in a bad mood.

588
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,208
She's never snapped
at me like that before.

589
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,291
Be nice, would ya?

590
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,375
Sakai.

591
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,541
Would run over
to the library with me--

592
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:40,833
I need help carrying some books.

593
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:42,666
Sure.

594
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:44,750
They're back.

595
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,958
How do they make
everything freeze like this?

596
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,333
They're using a Seal.

597
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:54,833
But they can't do that
inside the school, can they?

598
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:56,833
The location
makes no difference,

599
00:34:56,916 --> 00:34:59,166
all that matters is you're here.

600
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,666
I knew this was going to happen.

601
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,791
You can't fight here!
Someone might get hurt!

602
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,625
I'm afraid we don't
have much of a choice.

603
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,541
I have to fight them.

604
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:19,208
I don't want my friends
to get dragged into this.

605
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,125
I've gotta keep them safe.

606
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,208
All of this is my fault.

607
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:26,250
Sorry about this.

608
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,875
Ike!

609
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,083
This'll be easy.

610
00:36:18,916 --> 00:36:20,250
Ike!

611
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,541
Yoshida, no!

612
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,375
Yoshida!

613
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,375
Yoshida!

614
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,375
You're the same Rinne that
I fought against the other day.

615
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,791
What is your Master's name?

616
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:42,958
You don't honestly
think I would ever tell you.

617
00:36:43,041 --> 00:36:45,208
No, I figured you
weren't gonna tell me.

618
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,916
But I gotta say, he must be a
real idiot since he keeps using

619
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,041
the same silly tactics
over and over again.

620
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,583
I mean come on.

621
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,625
Damn you.

622
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,916
How do you do, young lady?

623
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,500
I was wondering when we'd
finally meet face-to-face.

624
00:37:11,583 --> 00:37:13,083
He must be one of those
Crimson Denizens

625
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,250
Shana was
talking about.

626
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,541
Impressive, I'm
surprised you were able

627
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,625
to defeat my
favorite Treasure Tool.

628
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,583
Regular Sharp usually
poses quite a challenge.

629
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,708
I'm sorry you had
to intervene, Master.

630
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,708
I should be the one
apologizing to you, my dear.

631
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:31,875
I shouldn't have given you a

632
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,041
Treasure Tool
you've never used before.

633
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,375
That Flame Haze
was so rough with you.

634
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,708
She's a brute, isn't she?

635
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,250
So you're that Rinne's master?

636
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,625
I am.

637
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,625
I am Friagne the Hunter,
and I am Marianne's master.

638
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:46,875
It's a pleasure to
meet you in person,

639
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,291
Alastor the
Flame of the Heavens.

640
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:50,916
Don't be fooled by
his appearance,

641
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,875
Friagne is incredibly dangerous.

642
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,583
He has killed
countless Flame Haze

643
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,125
with his many Treasure Tools.

644
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,250
He's an extremely
powerful Crimson Lord.

645
00:37:58,333 --> 00:37:59,500
Got it.

646
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm surprised with
your choice of contractor.

647
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,625
The Flaming
Haired-Blazing Eyed Hunter.

648
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,000
I've heard rumor
of your strength

649
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:07,625
but I have to admit
I'm disappointed.

650
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,916
What did you say to me?

651
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,666
It's a shame, Alastor.

652
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,750
All of your powers
are going to waste.

653
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,875
You never should've entered
a contract with a pathetic

654
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:18,000
little girl who can't control
the power you've given her.

655
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,125
Give me five minutes and
I'll show you what I can do.

656
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,708
I would love to
but I don't think this is

657
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,750
the right time
for battle, little one.

658
00:38:25,833 --> 00:38:28,666
Besides, I can't chance
harming the Mystes.

659
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,208
But I'll be back.

660
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:33,250
After all, this is
my hunting ground.

661
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,833
I can't wait to see
what's inside of that Mystes,

662
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:39,375
but I'll find out, soon enough.

663
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:45,333
We must be cautious.

664
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,083
He is no ordinary
Crimson Denizen.

665
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,500
Friagne is a Lord
of the Crimson Realm

666
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,750
and known to be a
collector of Treasure Tools.

667
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,708
I'm not surprised
he's after the Mystes.

668
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,750
He mentioned that this
is his "hunting ground."

669
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,791
He must be the reason there are
so many Torches in this city!

670
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:07,583
Yes, I would venture to guess
that it's all part of his plan.

671
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:09,416
That guy is insane.

672
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:12,250
I need to rebuild
before we leave the Seal.

673
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,333
So move,
I need to use that girl.

674
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,750
Use her for what?

675
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,791
I'm going to use what's
left of her power of existence

676
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,166
to rebuild everything
damaged in the battle.

677
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,666
But that would
kill her, wouldn't it?

678
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,041
Well yes, but she's
near death anyway and

679
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,625
since there aren't
any Torches around

680
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,916
I've no choice but to
use the half-dead girl.

681
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,541
What's left of her
power of existence

682
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,625
should be enough
to fix everything.

683
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,875
If you're that worried about her

684
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,125
I can save enough
to make a Torch.

685
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,625
I won't let you!

686
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,791
I don't want Yoshida to go
through what I'm dealing with!

687
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,375
Sorry, but it can't be helped.

688
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,541
I need power of existence to fix
everything back to how it was.

689
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:46,625
I could just always
use someone else.

690
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:48,375
What about that guy?

691
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,583
I can't decide.

692
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,416
Well, if you want,
I could just use you.

693
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,875
Let's do that.

694
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:02,250
Seriously?

695
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,166
You threw a fit when I tried
to use one of them and

696
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,375
then you make a
decision that quickly?

697
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,000
It's the right thing to do.

698
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:09,250
So you're going to throw away

699
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,541
the little bit of
time you have left?

700
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,916
I'm not throwing it away.

701
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,833
I'm using it!

702
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:22,291
It's so weird--no, it's
awkward--no, it's annoying!

703
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,708
That Torch is so annoying!

704
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:27,625
You used a lot of his
existence without hesitation.

705
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,083
What was I supposed to do?!

706
00:40:29,166 --> 00:40:32,041
It told me to use its own
power so that's what I did.

707
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,125
I left it enough to
have a little more time.

708
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,666
I thought I might
find you up here.

709
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,166
What?
I'm not allowed?

710
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,208
No, I didn't say that.

711
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,333
How did you know
where to find us?

712
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:46,916
It's hard to explain.

713
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
I kinda felt you guys up here.

714
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:50,833
I see.

715
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,041
It makes sense that
after such an intense battle

716
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,125
you would start to
sense our presence.

717
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,291
So what do you want?

718
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,666
Uh, nothing.

719
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,208
I just wanted to
come check on you.

720
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:02,083
It's weird knowing a girl is
sitting on my roof in the rain.

721
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,083
You should come inside.

722
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:04,083
Do what?

723
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,708
Well, this can't be comfortable.

724
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,250
Besides, if you wanna keep
an eye on me I would think

725
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:10,166
you'd probably want
to stay close, right?

726
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:11,833
Good point.

727
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,875
The thought never
crossed your mind?

728
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:16,583
It's not some brilliant idea--
there's no need to brag!

729
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:17,583
What're you talking about?

730
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,000
I wasn't bragging.

731
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:21,666
Take me inside.

732
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,500
Uh...
Okay, sure.

733
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,166
Follow me.

734
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:29,500
You can go ahead
and sleep in my bed.

735
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,541
I'll go sleep in my Dad's study.

736
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,750
I came inside so I could
keep watch over you and

737
00:41:33,833 --> 00:41:35,500
now you want to
sleep in a different room?

738
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:36,458
Uh.

739
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,666
Well, yeah.

740
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,541
You're the one
who thought up this idea.

741
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,166
You'll sleep here.

742
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,791
Whoa!

743
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,333
What do you think you're doing?!

744
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,833
I'm getting undressed.

745
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,208
Isn't that obvious?

746
00:41:49,291 --> 00:41:52,958
Yeah but-It's just--
I should leave.

747
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,333
Why are you embarrassed
all of a sudden?

748
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:58,166
It's just a Torch,
why do you care?

749
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,916
Go find a place to hide.

750
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Uh, yeah, of course.

751
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,583
Hurry up!

752
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,375
Quit rushing me!

753
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,708
Do you need pajamas?

754
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,083
No peeking!

755
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:11,750
I wasn't peeking, alright?!

756
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:14,875
I was just asking if you needed
to borrow some pajamas!

757
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,625
I don't need any.

758
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,458
I can just sleep
in my underwear.

759
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,250
Alastor uses his
flame to purify me so

760
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:24,166
bathing and changing
aren't really necessary.

761
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:28,458
So do you really think that
hunter who attacked us at

762
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,375
school is the one who's created
all the Torches in this city?

763
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,208
I'm positive it's him.

764
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,208
I've never seen a
Denizen consume so

765
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:38,250
much power of
existence in one city.

766
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,166
Although Torches
are used to maintain

767
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,875
the world's balance, it is
also possible to throw off

768
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:45,375
that balance if there
are too many Torches.

769
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,916
But for all we know,
that could be

770
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,333
exactly what Friagne
is hoping to do.

771
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:50,583
What good would that do him?

772
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,833
The more Torches
there are in a city the higher

773
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:55,958
the likelihood that a valuable
Mystes like you will show up.

774
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,500
Which in turn,
lures out Flame Haze.

775
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,833
This city is indeed
his hunting ground.

776
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:04,083
True, but he's being careless
because he has no way

777
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:06,791
of being able to know which
Flame Haze is going to show up.

778
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,875
Exactly.

779
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,875
His plan is not without fault.

780
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:13,375
Although he is a very powerful
Lord of the Crimson Realm.

781
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,000
But I wonder what's giving him
this false sense of confidence.

782
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:19,416
I'll find out when I
face off with him again.

783
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,666
Since there's no school
tomorrow, maybe you should try

784
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,791
to lure him
outside the city limits.

785
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,333
I'd hate to see more
innocent people get involved.

786
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:27,875
Good idea.

787
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,125
But that means you're going
to have to come along with us,

788
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,250
since, well you know
you are the bait.

789
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:32,208
Yeah, I know.

790
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,833
I'll go with you.

791
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:38,708
That sucked.

792
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,000
I should have punched
him another ten times!

793
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:52,041
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

794
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:53,041
It's just a Torch.

795
00:43:53,125 --> 00:43:54,125
You don't get it.

796
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,208
It's no different
than being nude in

797
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:57,458
front of a rock
or a forest of trees.

798
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:58,958
Why are you so embarrassed?

799
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:00,125
You've never cared before.

800
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,291
It just made me
uncomfortable, okay?!

801
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,083
That Torch is like
a human to you.

802
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:07,000
And you haven't interacted with
a human being in a long time.

803
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:07,916
Is that it?

804
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,166
I know that it isn't human.

805
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,916
And it's gonna disappear
like every other Torch.

806
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:33,500
No one will ever be able to
figure out our plan, Marianne.

807
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,833
Not even that pesky
Flame of Heaven.

808
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:41,750
That may be so, Master,
but I'm worried about

809
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:45,208
all the Flame Haze that
have come to this city lately.

810
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:48,833
Please be careful.
Please.

811
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,500
Don't you worry, my dear.

812
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,916
Everything is going
according to plan.

813
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,500
All we need is
a little more power

814
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:59,083
of existence and we can proceed.

815
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:02,333
I won't allow them
to hinder our plans.

816
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:31,875
The Torches light up
the city so brightly.

817
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,750
Once we are victorious our lives
will change for the better.

818
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:39,083
You won't be just a Rinne
anymore, Marianne.

819
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:43,583
You will become an existence
that lives within this world.

820
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,375
You're so good to me.

821
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:53,333
I can't thank you enough for all
you've done for me, Master.

822
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:01,000
I've just begun,
my dear, Marianne.

823
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,833
It makes me sad.

824
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:08,583
If I wasn't continually
feeding you energy,

825
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:11,625
you wouldn't have the
power to last three days.

826
00:46:13,666 --> 00:46:16,666
I don't know what
I'd do if I lost you.

827
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,791
I feel it, too, my love.

828
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,333
I would never want
to be anywhere

829
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,666
but by your side, Master.

830
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,666
Oh!
My sweet Marianne!

831
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,625
Your precious words
have touched my heart.

832
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,625
We'll be together.

833
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:36,583
I swear to you that I will
make it happen, my love.

834
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,791
That's why we
came to this world.

835
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,625
My sole purpose for seeking
power of existence is for you.

836
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,791
Everything I've done.

837
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,625
It is all for you, Marianne.

838
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,416
Something's not right.

839
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,583
There're too many Torches.

840
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,333
I've never seen so many.

841
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,000
Guess the rumors
we heard were true.

842
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,458
This place really does stink.

843
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,250
Yeah.

844
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,750
It stinks alright.

845
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:23,166
It smells of your
booze-laden breath!

846
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:28,125
Shut your trap, stupid Marco!

847
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,250
Oh wow.

848
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,541
You feel that--there must
be another Flame Haze here.

849
00:47:32,625 --> 00:47:33,791
Yeah, I felt it.

850
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,708
Y'know, if someone else
is already on the case

851
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,625
we should probably just drop it.

852
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:40,708
I don't remember reading
that in the rule books.

853
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,291
I figure whoever gets
there first gets the kill.

854
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,208
At least, that's
how it should work.

855
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:46,458
Damn straight!

856
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:48,000
You tell 'em, little lady!

857
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:52,166
Let's tear this city apart my
beloved goblet, Margery Daw!

858
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,125
Sounds like a plan.

859
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,291
You feel that, Alastor?

860
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,125
Yes.

861
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:17,208
It's another Flame Haze.

862
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:24,041
The crew has just
passed the "Yellow Band"

863
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:26,916
which is about 28,000 feet
above sea level.

864
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,500
We've reached the
part of Mt. Everest

865
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,958
that is considered
the most difficult to climb.

866
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,541
We are currently
prepping to make our

867
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:34,916
journey to the very
top of the mountain--

868
00:48:37,666 --> 00:48:39,666
I can't do it.

869
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,750
I'm too embarrassed to give

870
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,250
those cookies to
Sakai right now.

871
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:03,250
I have to build up some courage
and then I'll be able to do it.

872
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,875
Someday I'll be brave enough to
tell him how I feel about him.

873
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,458
Hurry!

874
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:25,625
I'm coming,
just give me a second.

875
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:31,875
You're the one who insisted
we fight outside the city.

876
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,750
Did you notice
his flame, Alastor?

877
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,583
It's back to full blaze.

878
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:43,208
I think I've figured out which

879
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:46,000
Treasure Tool
is inside that Mystes.

880
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,250
I'm having a hard time
getting used to this.

881
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:11,541
You know, seeing the Torches.

882
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,166
I feel like I'm invading
their privacy, but it's hard to

883
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,041
avoid looking at
the pulsating flame.

884
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:20,666
Pulsating?

885
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,583
What do you mean by that?

886
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:24,500
The flames inside
of the Torches.

887
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:26,416
They're pulsating
like a heartbeat.

888
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,166
The flame expands and contracts.

889
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,416
Can't you see it?

890
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,000
No, I can't.

891
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:32,875
Me either.

892
00:50:32,958 --> 00:50:34,000
It's just a steady blue flame.

893
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:35,333
What?

894
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:37,458
It's so clear I don't know
how you could miss it.

895
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,208
You're really weird you know.

896
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,208
I've never met
a Mystes like you.

897
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:50,791
I bet you can see it because of
the Treasure Tool inside of you.

898
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:56,291
If it is what I think it is,
it's an extremely powerful Tool.

899
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,750
However, there's no
real way of knowing

900
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,375
unless we open you
up and have a look.

901
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:04,000
It worries me that the Torches'
flames are pulsating.

902
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:06,125
I've never heard
of such a thing.

903
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,333
Are they all
doing it or just a few?

904
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:09,666
All of them.

905
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,208
Well, at least
as far as I can see.

906
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:14,041
A Torch's flame isn't
supposed to pulse like that.

907
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,500
I can't help but
wonder if it's happening

908
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:19,166
to all of the
Torches in the city.

909
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:21,458
What do you think it is?

910
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,916
It must be some kind of trick.

911
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,333
An unrestricted spell!

912
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:48,375
That was a sonar
unrestricted spell.

913
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:50,458
Hey, why did that
person just disappear?!

914
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,958
In order to
perform such a spell,

915
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,750
someone would need a
lot of power of existence.

916
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,958
I'm assuming that the Torch
was used for that purpose.

917
00:51:57,041 --> 00:51:57,833
Seriously?!

918
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,250
But who would do such a thing?!

919
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:01,208
Do you think it's
that bastard Friagne?!

920
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,666
No, it's not him.

921
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:06,125
I suspect it's the Flame Haze
we sensed last night.

922
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,041
I guess they're
not leaving after all.

923
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,333
What?!

924
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,833
There's another Flame Haze
here besides Shana?

925
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:13,125
Would you just shut up
for one minute?!

926
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,583
It's probably because there
are so many Torches here.

927
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,208
I'm actually surprised that more
Flame Haze haven't noticed.

928
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,958
They must be trying
to lure out the hunter.

929
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,083
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

930
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:34,875
Cover all corners and find the
ghost who disrupts our dreams!

931
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,208
Why are all of the Torches
suddenly disappearing?

932
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:55,875
It seems that they were somehow
able to figure out my plans.

933
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,833
I'm afraid we're going
to have to hurry, Marianne.

934
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:01,708
My patience has worn thin;
these visits from

935
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:04,250
various Flame Haze
have been troublesome.

936
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:06,416
I shall punish them.

937
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:39,083
Well, damn it,
I guess he didn't fall for it.

938
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,041
Yeah, but I'll bet
he's hot on our trail.

939
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,625
Who knows?

940
00:53:42,708 --> 00:53:45,416
He could jump out screaming "You
found me!" and try to fight us.

941
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,708
I don't think so, but it seems
we've lured out something else.

942
00:53:50,583 --> 00:53:52,500
What do you think
you're doing here?!

943
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:55,750
Now, now, what kind
of introduction is that?

944
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,208
Can't I at least get a "hello"?

945
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:59,333
It's The Claws and
Fangs of Violation

946
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:01,041
and the Chanter of Elegies!

947
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,750
I should've known
it was you two!

948
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,041
Hey, hey, hey!

949
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,083
How you doin',
old Flame of Heaven?

950
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:08,750
Let me guess, this is
your Flame Haze, right?

951
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:11,083
The Flaming-Haired,
Blazing-Eyed Hunter?

952
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,041
Kinda scrawny lookin'.

953
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:16,416
Why have the
two of you come here?

954
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,666
Are you the one who did it?

955
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,791
Answer me, lady!

956
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,000
What?

957
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,750
You're the one
who did it, right?

958
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,125
How could you?!

959
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,958
How could you
destroy so many Torches

960
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,416
without any kind of remorse?!

961
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,458
Whoa.

962
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:42,750
Who is this kid?

963
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,666
Evidently he's a Torch as well.

964
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,125
You took their existence,
without even giving

965
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,666
them the chance
to tie up loose ends.

966
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:53,000
They could have been
trying to help somebody!

967
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:00,625
You destroyed them.

968
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:02,750
How could you do that?!

969
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:13,916
I won't allow you to
talk that way to me, kid.

970
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,750
Maybe you should
destroy that Torch, too!

971
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:16,791
It's really annoying!

972
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:17,625
Don't do it!

973
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:19,041
That Torch is a Mystes.

974
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,916
You mustn't be reckless with it.

975
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,083
Seriously?!

976
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:25,333
No wonder it got
all bent outta shape.

977
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:26,666
Damn it.

978
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,750
I'm not trying to side with
the Mystes, however,

979
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,416
I can't fathom destroying
Torches for no reason.

980
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,166
A Flame Haze is
supposed to maintain

981
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,166
the world's balance,
not disrupt it.

982
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,416
What the hell are
you blabbing about?

983
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,916
I think it's more disruptive to
just leave all the Torches here.

984
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,875
I mean, what kind
of balance is that?

985
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,750
Yeah, it's more like the two of
you are neglecting your duty.

986
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,958
We are aware that there
are an excessive number

987
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,916
of Torches here, but it
appears that these Torches

988
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,416
are being used as
part of a larger plan.

989
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,791
What?
Like some kinda trick?

990
00:55:56,333 --> 00:56:00,041
Well, it might be a trap set
by the Flame Haze assassin.

991
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:02,291
I'm sure you've
heard the horrible news.

992
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,750
Many of our kind have gone

993
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:06,500
missing after
visiting this place.

994
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:10,875
That's why we decided to come
out here and check things out.

995
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:12,666
I'm sure the others
were lured here

996
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,958
by the excessive
number of Torches.

997
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:17,208
Yeah, we were pretty
shocked when we got here.

998
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,333
There's so many.

999
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,000
It's ridiculous.

1000
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,541
Somebody's up to something.

1001
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,416
I've got a bad feeling.

1002
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,250
Alastor, do you feel it?

1003
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,333
I never expected
to stumble upon this.

1004
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:47,750
I thought that Flame Haze
didn't like working together.

1005
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,416
It's Friagne!

1006
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,666
Well, well, I had a feeling
that we might run into you.

1007
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,000
We're up against
Friagne the Hunter!

1008
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,333
This is gonna be great!

1009
00:56:57,416 --> 00:56:59,041
So, the Chanter of Elegies,

1010
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:02,208
and The Claws and
Fangs of Violation.

1011
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:05,208
Now I know where that crude
unrestricted spell came from.

1012
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,458
How could you destroy all the

1013
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:08,458
beautiful artwork I've
created in this city?

1014
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,791
You've really pissed me off.

1015
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,875
You haven't seen anything yet--

1016
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:14,708
we're just getting started!

1017
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:16,291
Let's do this!

1018
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:24,958
This is it, Friagne!

1019
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,708
Your head is mine!

1020
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:37,958
Be careful.

1021
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,458
He's dangerous.

1022
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,000
You're too slow!

1023
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,458
It didn't work!

1024
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,083
How'd he avoid it?!

1025
00:57:57,791 --> 00:58:00,666
I'm wearing a
flame resistant ring.

1026
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,291
It's a Treasure Tool
I acquired called Azure

1027
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,416
which allows me to
withstand any flame attack.

1028
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,416
I can tell you're a collector.

1029
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,291
You're rambling on about some
stupid ring we don't care about.

1030
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,291
Yeah, talk about a snooze fest!

1031
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,958
I'm sorry to hear that
you're not entertained.

1032
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:17,708
In that case--

1033
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,708
I'll step it up a notch.

1034
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:30,666
This one's called Bubble Loot.

1035
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,750
And it's one of my favorite

1036
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:33,833
Treasure Tools from
my collection.

1037
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:36,125
There's no weapon
in existence that can

1038
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:39,250
break free from its
golden chains.

1039
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:44,416
I'm done playing your
silly games, Friagne!

1040
00:58:53,875 --> 00:58:55,291
Damn it.

1041
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,500
I forgot that creep has a
thing for playing with dolls.

1042
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:16,125
If I can't break free,
then I'll destroy the source!

1043
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,958
Your dolls can't stop me!

1044
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:30,958
That bell.

1045
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,666
Get back!

1046
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,666
If we had been any
closer to that explosion

1047
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,500
we would've been
goners for sure!

1048
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,666
That Mystes sensed it.

1049
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:05,000
It anticipated
the explosion from my

1050
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,291
Dance Party Treasure Tool.

1051
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:10,541
I wonder if it's because of
the Tool that's inside of it.

1052
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:27,291
I should dispose of you
for being a nuisance.

1053
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,958
Isn't this interesting?

1054
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:53,541
The Flame Haze refuses
to strike the Mystes.

1055
01:00:56,833 --> 01:01:00,000
I'll be taking your
little friend with me.

1056
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,125
Come back here, coward!

1057
01:01:03,208 --> 01:01:04,666
You still want to fight me?

1058
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:07,416
Then I'd be glad to
give you another chance.

1059
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,125
If you want to see the
Mystes again then meet

1060
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:11,458
me at the highest point
in the city tonight.

1061
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:15,125
We'll play this out on
the grandest of stages!

1062
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,583
I can't believe
we let him get away!

1063
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:34,958
Why didn't you
just slice through it?

1064
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,666
I couldn't do it.

1065
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,916
These Flame Haze should be easy

1066
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,291
for us to defeat,
thanks to that Mystes.

1067
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,583
Once we have disposed of them,

1068
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:04,041
the rest should be
a piece of cake my love.

1069
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,500
You'll be reborn.

1070
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:07,875
And you will live,
dear Marianne.

1071
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,250
You'll become an
existence all your own.

1072
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,375
You won't have to rely
on anyone else ever again.

1073
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,583
And finally, we'll
be able to be together.

1074
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,625
Oh, Master!

1075
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:23,125
So he wasn't just
searching for Treasure Tools.

1076
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:24,833
He was collecting
power of existence

1077
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:27,125
to bring his doll to life!

1078
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:30,958
Damn it. I feel so
helpless just sitting here.

1079
01:02:44,791 --> 01:02:46,333
I couldn't do it.

1080
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,125
How come?

1081
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,541
You've become attached--

1082
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:56,750
it's what happens when
you interact with humans.

1083
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,583
But he's not human.

1084
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:08,083
Whoa, don't go overboard!

1085
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:09,708
Why don't you try
sippin' the stuff?!

1086
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:11,583
You're not gonna be able
to fight if you're drunk!

1087
01:03:11,666 --> 01:03:13,083
Well, I can't lure him out--

1088
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:16,000
he's not gonna fall for another
sonar unrestricted spell!

1089
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,041
So I have no choice but
to sit here and drink

1090
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,208
until we meet him at nightfall.

1091
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:26,625
Before we head
into battle tonight,

1092
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:29,000
you should probably
purify me, Marcosias.

1093
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:30,416
Damn it, Margery!

1094
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,125
I can't keep using the Purifying
Flame to sober you up!

1095
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:44,833
What have I gotten myself into?

1096
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:48,375
I'm not throwing
it away, I'm using it!

1097
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,291
So how long do plan to sit
here feeling sorry for yourself?

1098
01:03:58,375 --> 01:04:00,916
I'm having to waste precious
time because of your screw up.

1099
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,750
I should be the one who's upset!

1100
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:05,708
Yeah and 'cause of you,
she's hammered!

1101
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,250
Look, if you're
not serious about this

1102
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,208
then you don't
have to come with us.

1103
01:04:13,666 --> 01:04:14,791
I'm coming!

1104
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:17,541
I will fight!

1105
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,708
Okay.

1106
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,291
There ya go, kid!

1107
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:25,583
Those are the eyes of
the Blazing-Eyed hunter!

1108
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:27,291
I can't wait for tonight!

1109
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,750
What d'ya think,
Flame of Heaven?

1110
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,625
It's gonna be awesome!

1111
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,458
Spectacular, isn't it?

1112
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:03,041
I dare say the perfect stage
for tonight's battle.

1113
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:06,458
All we have to do now is wait
for the Flame Haze to show.

1114
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:24,416
Take a good look, Mystes.

1115
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,958
This gun is
called Trigger Happy.

1116
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,583
It's a wonderful
little Treasure Tool

1117
01:05:28,666 --> 01:05:30,500
that is used to kill Flame Haze.

1118
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,958
A Flame Haze uses its body

1119
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,708
to contain a Crimson Lord.

1120
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:39,500
In the case of your friend,
that Lord would be Alastor,

1121
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,500
one also known as
the Flame of Heaven.

1122
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,750
However, a Crimson Lord's power
is hard to keep contained.

1123
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,208
For that reason, when
they enter a contract their

1124
01:05:51,291 --> 01:05:55,041
existence is put into
a kind of hibernation.

1125
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:58,291
But this gun, my
precious Trigger Happy--

1126
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:02,708
--is capable of liberating the

1127
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,375
Crimson Lord from
its containment.

1128
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:12,666
The resulting outpour of
power is absolutely explosive,

1129
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:16,000
and it kills the Lord's
contractor instantaneously.

1130
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:20,041
In other words, the Flame
Haze suffers a fiery death.

1131
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,416
Amazing, isn't it?

1132
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,666
Furthermore, the freed Lord
is so concerned about

1133
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,083
throwing off the
world's balance--

1134
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,958
they return to
the Crimson Realm.

1135
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:28,750
I've done this many times--

1136
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:29,916
that's why I've
earned the nickname

1137
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,666
the "Flame Haze Assassin."

1138
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:34,291
But for tonight, I chose
a spot high enough that the

1139
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:37,041
Flame of Heaven
wouldn't affect the city below.

1140
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:40,916
Dear Marianne, tonight's
performance is in your honor.

1141
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,375
Oh thank you, Master.

1142
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:44,916
I don't get it.

1143
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Why is he worried
about affecting the city?

1144
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,750
Why would he care if
the entire city was wiped out?

1145
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,458
We should get going.

1146
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,333
You ready to go on
a rampage, Marcosias?

1147
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:24,500
Hell, yeah! Let's go!

1148
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,833
Don't let him shoot you!

1149
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,083
He's got Trigger Happy?!

1150
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:16,875
Damn it!

1151
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:18,625
So that's his trump card!

1152
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,583
You've got to be careful!

1153
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,000
I know.

1154
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:31,333
Silly little girl.

1155
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:34,041
I don't think you're strong
enough to take me on.

1156
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,958
Shana!

1157
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,166
I thought Flame Haze weren't
supposed to work together.

1158
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,666
Well, today is special!

1159
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:40,625
The Torches' pulsing
is getting stronger.

1160
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,666
What the hell is going on?

1161
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:51,791
Shana!

1162
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:53,291
He's not just hunting--
he has some sort of plan

1163
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:55,416
set up throughout the city!

1164
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,375
What the--

1165
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,333
He's pulling power of existence
from Torches all over the city.

1166
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:39,750
That's it!

1167
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:44,041
Friagne the Hunter, are you
attempting a City Devouring?!

1168
01:10:44,916 --> 01:10:46,208
You bastard!

1169
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,000
A City Devouring?!

1170
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,125
There's nothing you
can do about it now.

1171
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,375
But yes, I'm performing
a spell that was

1172
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:57,208
cast by a powerful
Crimson Lord long ago.

1173
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:01,541
It allows you to turn an entire

1174
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:04,750
city into pure
power of existence.

1175
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:14,208
You won't be able to stop me.

1176
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,416
In fact, it has already begun.

1177
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,458
Sorry, you're too late.

1178
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,666
If he accomplishes this
City Devouring spell,

1179
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,750
everything will be destroyed--

1180
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,291
Mom and everyone else will die!

1181
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,125
Now that we know what his plans
are it's time to get serious!

1182
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:47,166
C'mon, partner!

1183
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,666
Yeah, I know!

1184
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,083
But how are we
going to stop him?

1185
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:53,291
We're gonna have to
find a way to kill Friagne!

1186
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,625
Hurry! We have to stop him or
the whole world will fall apart!

1187
01:11:55,708 --> 01:11:56,791
Right!

1188
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:21,708
What's with the bell?

1189
01:12:21,791 --> 01:12:24,458
They don't attack every
time that he rings it. So why?

1190
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:30,708
Now I get it.

1191
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,166
The attacks aren't
triggered by the bell!

1192
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,833
He's using it to summon
the City Devouring!

1193
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:47,416
I have to tell Shana.

1194
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,833
I'm the only one
who has it figured out.

1195
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,375
We can still stop it.

1196
01:12:51,458 --> 01:12:53,541
We can save the city!

1197
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:57,916
It's up to me to let her know.

1198
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,666
All it takes is one
shot from Trigger Happy

1199
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,750
and they'll be out of my way.

1200
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,625
But these two are
stronger than I expected.

1201
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,125
Please, Master Friagne.

1202
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,416
Let me take care of them.

1203
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,000
No, it's far too dangerous.

1204
01:13:39,083 --> 01:13:40,791
Stay here with me.

1205
01:13:43,625 --> 01:13:45,208
I have to protect you.

1206
01:13:45,291 --> 01:13:47,750
If you were to be killed by
those evil Flame Haze

1207
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,333
then I would die along with you.

1208
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:54,666
However, if I died,
you would live on.

1209
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:57,916
Let me do this.

1210
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,666
To show my love.

1211
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:03,375
I would gladly give
my life for you, Friagne.

1212
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:07,041
But you are my
reason for living.

1213
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,416
Do it now, Master!

1214
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,041
Hurry!

1215
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:38,416
My beloved Friagne.

1216
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:20,208
Dear Marianne, as long as I'm
alive, as long as I breathe,

1217
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:24,041
I promise I will work to find
a way to bring you back to life.

1218
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:27,000
And then we'll
be together forever.

1219
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:29,041
Just the two of us.

1220
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:32,708
Just a few more
rings of this bell,

1221
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:36,125
and the City Devouring
will be complete.

1222
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:45,166
But before that, you will die!

1223
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,583
Oh crap.

1224
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:52,708
You, will pay for this!

1225
01:15:53,333 --> 01:15:55,750
Shana, Seal!

1226
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,333
The Seal stopped
the City Devouring.

1227
01:16:39,958 --> 01:16:41,500
Destroy it all!

1228
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,916
Burn down the
city and everyone in it.

1229
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,958
Everything!

1230
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:49,583
Shana!

1231
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,208
He shot her!

1232
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,083
What the-- ?!

1233
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,500
He's been let loose!

1234
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,250
The Flame of Heaven.

1235
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:23,791
He's so powerful!

1236
01:17:23,875 --> 01:17:25,041
This could be the end of us!

1237
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,125
C'mon, we've gotta
hurry up get outta here!

1238
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:28,875
You've gotta be kidding me!

1239
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:31,666
Pick up the pace Marco!

1240
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:56,208
No.

1241
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:57,458
It can't be.

1242
01:17:57,541 --> 01:17:59,333
So that's Alastor's true form.

1243
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:00,916
I never thought I'd
see the day that the

1244
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,458
Flame of Heaven would be
summoned to this world.

1245
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:05,333
And all because
the scrawny little thing

1246
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,750
was shot with Trigger Happy.

1247
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,916
Friagne the Hunter.

1248
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,250
You are a pathetic fool.

1249
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,750
No.

1250
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:16,875
The Flame of Heaven.

1251
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:23,375
Despite your efforts you
have not destroyed the child.

1252
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,375
My Flame Haze
is strong enough to

1253
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:28,208
allow me to manifest
and still survive.

1254
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:31,083
She is a miraculous being.

1255
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:42,458
Do you doubt my wisdom
as a Crimson Lord?

1256
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:44,750
I would never enter
a contract with one

1257
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:47,291
who could not handle my power.

1258
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,791
This is the end.

1259
01:18:51,666 --> 01:18:54,166
Flame of Retribution!

1260
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,416
Marianne.

1261
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,708
Hey.

1262
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:01,000
So, do you think
I'm gonna make it?

1263
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,666
Your flame is very
close to burning out.

1264
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,333
I'm afraid it's
nothing more than

1265
01:20:06,416 --> 01:20:08,666
a flickering glow right now.

1266
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:12,291
Time's up.

1267
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:17,833
This feels so strange.

1268
01:20:17,916 --> 01:20:21,041
I can't believe I'm
actually disappearing,

1269
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:24,083
but you know what,
I'm not sad about it.

1270
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:26,375
I accomplished something.

1271
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:31,583
I may just be a Torch, but I
was able to help save my city.

1272
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:34,500
Even though no one
will ever know about it.

1273
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,583
Don't be such a worry wart.

1274
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:42,375
You've done nothing but worry
since the first day we met.

1275
01:20:42,458 --> 01:20:44,000
You think so?

1276
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:47,208
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1277
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,250
Shana.

1278
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,708
I have a favor to ask of you.

1279
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:54,541
What is it?

1280
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,125
The name I gave you.

1281
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,125
Promise me
you'll continue to use it.

1282
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,541
What's going on?!

1283
01:21:29,625 --> 01:21:31,166
I'm still here!

1284
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:32,625
I didn't disappear!

1285
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:35,125
But h--?!
How did this happen?!

1286
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,541
What's so funny?

1287
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:41,875
You're so silly!

1288
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:45,083
Yuji Sakai, you have
just witnessed the power

1289
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,750
of the Treasure Tool
that lies within you.

1290
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:51,875
It fully recovers your power of
existence each day at midnight.

1291
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:55,666
It's called The
Midnight Lost Child.

1292
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,125
Then that means--

1293
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:58,166
Yup.

1294
01:21:58,250 --> 01:21:59,791
You're not gonna disappear.

1295
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:02,291
The Treasure Tool inside
of you is very valuable

1296
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,750
and soon Denizens
will come looking for it.

1297
01:22:04,833 --> 01:22:06,416
So we'll continue
to keep watch over you

1298
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,916
to make sure
that you remain safe.

1299
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,416
That okay with you?

1300
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,708
Of course it is.

1301
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:18,750
Glad to hear it.

1302
