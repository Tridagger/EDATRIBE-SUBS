2
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,411
Kakushi: Wake up.

3
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,412
I said wake up!

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,182
You gotta--
hey, can you even hear me?

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,552
Come on! Get up!

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,354
Are you gonna sleep all day?

7
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,356
Wake the hell up, will you?!

8
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,158
( Tanjiro gasps )

9
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,493
Hashira: I heard
he was a Demon Slayer

10
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,894
with a demon in tow,

11
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,497
so I was expecting
someone with more flair.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,768
But it's just some
ordinary-looking kid? Too bad.

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,770
( Beads rattle )

14
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,638
Hashira 2:
We must see that this boy

15
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,906
is put on trial to be judged.

16
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:42,741
So it shall be!

17
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:48,781
Hashira 3: To think that he's
been protecting his sister,

18
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,448
who's now a demon.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,386
What a brave and beautiful
display of sibling love!

20
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,189
Tanjiro: What--
who are these people--

21
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,391
Kakushi: Don't open your mouth
until you're told!

22
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,393
Do you know who you're
in the presence of?

23
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,462
These are the Hashira!

24
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:06,799
( Singers vocalizing )

25
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,468
Tanjiro: The Hashira?

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,403
What is that?

27
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,405
I have no idea.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,075
Who are all these people?

29
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,782
Where even am I?

30
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:30,355
Shinobu: This is the demon
slayers's headquarters.

31
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:33,425
You are here because you,
Tanjiro kamado,

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,627
are to be put on trial.

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,695

37

( birds chirping )

38
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,272
Shinobu: Before we
begin the trial,

39
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,675
why don't you explain the crime
you have been accused of--

40
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,877
Hashira 2:
There's no need for a trial!

41
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,078
Shinobu: Huh?

42
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,349
Rengoku: Protecting a demon
is a clear violation!

43
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,685
We can deal with this
on our own!

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,088
We shall execute them both!

45
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,359
Uzui: In that case,
I'll decapitate them with style.

46
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,763
I'll show you the most dramatic
spray of blood ever!

47
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,498
It'll be a spectacle.

48
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,569
Mitsuri: No way!

49
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,906
You'd really kill
such an adorable child as him?

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,109
Such a thought
fills my heart with sorrow.

51
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:03,181
Gyomei: Alas, to see
such a pitiful creature as this.

52
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:05,317
I grieve for him.

53
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,387
Perhaps it would have been
better if he hadn't been born.

54
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:14,026
Muichiro: Um, what was
the shape of that cloud again?

55
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,562
What was it called?

56
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,798
Tanjiro: Wait.

57
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,267
Where's Nezuko?

58
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,268
Kakushi: Hey, you.

59
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,803
The Hashira are speaking.

60
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,671
What are you looking at?

61
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,474
Your eyes should be over there.

62
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,476
These are the nine
highest-ranking swordsmen

63
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,678
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

64
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,547
Tanjiro: That's the Hashira?

65
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,483
Gyomei: Let's end his misery.

66
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,618
Rengoku: Right!

67
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,686
Uzui: And let's
do so with flair.

68
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:42,687
( Tanjiro grunts )

69
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,688
Kakushi: Hey!

70
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,424
Tanjiro: Nezuko!

71
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,692
Where did you take her?

72
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,495
Nezuko! Zenitsu!

73
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,698
Inosuke! Murata!

74
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,567
Hashira 4: Never mind this boy.

75
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,902
What will we do with Tomioka?

76
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,205
( Tanjiro gasps )

77
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,241
¶

78
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,777
Hashira 4:
Seeing him standing there

79
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,180
without any restraints
is making me feel ill.

80
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,182
Based on what kocho told us,

81
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,718
he's just as guilty
of breaking the Corps rules.

82
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,055
How should we make him
take responsibility?

83
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,458
What kind of lesson
shall we teach him?

84
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:26,198
What do you have to say
for yourself, Tomioka?

85
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,071
Tanjiro: He's in this situation
because of me.

86
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,676
Mitsuri: Iguro, you're
as sharp tongued as ever, I see.

87
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:39,778
I love that side of you!

88
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,355
Tomioka's all by himself,
all stoic-like.

89
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,724
What a cutie!

90
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,092
( Water splashes )

91
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,760
Shinobu: Oh, I think it's fine.

92
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,763
He did come here
without resisting.

93
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,200
Let's come up
with a penalty later.

94
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:09,574
What I'm more interested in
is hearing this boy's story.

95
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,310
He's been traveling
with a demon alongside him,

96
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,847
despite being
a Demon Slayer himself.

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,781
I wish to hear why

98
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,251
and hear it straight
from the boy's mouth.

99
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,853
What he's done is unquestionably

100
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,455
against
the Demon Slayer Corps rules.

101
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,190
( Tanjiro gasps )

102
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,259
Shinobu: You are aware of that,
aren't you?

103
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,194
( Tanjiro stammers )

104
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:33,465
Shinobu: Tanjiro kamado,

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,868
why are you traveling
with a demon,

106
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,736
as a fellow Demon Slayer?

107
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,573
Uzui: Who cares why?

108
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,142
Shinobu: You can take your time.

109
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:45,444
Just answer the question.

110
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,414
( Tanjiro gasps )

111
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,615
( Grunts )

112
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,816
- She's my--

113
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:53,085
she's my young--

114

( Groans )

116
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,364
Shinobu: It looks like
you need some water.

117
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,703
I can tell
you've injured your jaw,

118
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,373
so please drink slowly.

119
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:17,442
I added an anesthetic
to the water to help.

120
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,378
( Tanjiro panting )

121
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,518
Shinobu: Your wounds
are still healing,

122
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,587
so you shouldn't
push yourself too much.

123
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,525
Are you ready to tell us
your story, Tanjiro?

124
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,795
( Tanjiro panting )

125
00:06:36,931 --> 00:06:39,598
That demon is my little sister!

126
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,401
My family was attacked
by a demon while I was gone,

127
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,536
and I lost almost everyone!

128
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,806
My sister
was turned into a demon,

129
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,409
but she's never hurt anyone!

130
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,611
She never has and never will!

131
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,348
She'll never harm a human being,
no matter what!

132
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,484
Iguro: Enough.
Spare us these absurd ramblings.

133
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,554
If she's family, it's no wonder
you're defending her.

134
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,223
I can't trust
a single word you're spouting.

135
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,626
I don't believe you
for a moment.

136
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,161
Gyomei: So sad.

137
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:11,896
He's been possessed by a demon.

138
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,698
Let us end this child's life

139
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:16,835
and free him
from this cursed existence!

140
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,837
Tanjiro: Please listen to me!

141
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,374
I became a swordsman in hopes
of finding a cure for her!

142
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,178
It has been two whole years
since Nezuko became a demon!

143
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:29,047
She's never devoured anyone
in that time!

144
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,849
Uzui: Your storytelling
is lacking

145
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,185
any vibrant sparks of color.

146
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,188
"She hasn't devoured anyone,
and she's not going to."

147
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,724
If you're gonna plead your case,
at least spice it up a bit!

148
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,227
( Bird trilling )

149
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,199
Muichiro: What's that bird
called again?

150
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:50,202
Was it...

151
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,603
Mitsuri: Excuse me.

152
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,673
Something about this
concerns me.

153
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,408
I find it hard to believe

154
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,111
the Master would have been
unaware of this situation.

155
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:02,214
( Men grunt )

156
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,150
Mitsuri: I don't think we should
act without his permission.

157
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:07,019
( Men grunt )

158
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,354
( Tanjiro gasps )

159
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,825
Mitsuri: Maybe it's best
if we wait until he arrives.

160
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,695
Tanjiro: My sister!
Let my sister fight by my side!

161
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:19,031
I know she can fight
as a Demon Slayer

162
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,701
to protect humans, so please...

163
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,369
Hashira 5: Well, well,

164
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,373
what kind of fun
do we have brewing here?

165
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,112
Is that the moron who brought
a demon along with him?

166
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,250
( Tanjiro gasps )

167
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,784
Hashira 5:
What the hell do you think

168
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,687
you're trying
to pull here, exactly?

169
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,656
Mitsuri: Those new scars

170
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
make Shinazugawa
look even more handsome!

171
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,662
Kakushi 2:
Please, Master Shinazugawa!

172
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,232
I must ask you
to put down that box.

173
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,205
Mitsuri: Wow!
Even when she's angry,

174
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,075
Shinobu still looks
as cool as ever.

175
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,279
Shinobu: Shinazugawa,
please don't act out of line.

176
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,448
Shinazugawa: Run that
by me again, kid?

177
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,552
"She can fight as a Demon Slayer
to protect humans."

178
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,687
Was that it?

179
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,756
You know what we call that?

180
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,526
Completely impossible,
you idiot!

181
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,762
( Nezuko gags )

182
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:24,730
( Tanjiro gasps )

183
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:31,436
Anyone who harms my sister
answers to me!

184
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,239
I don't give a damn
if you're one of the Hashira!

185
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:37,042
( Shinazugawa chuckles )

186
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,113
Well, how very nice for you.

187
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,715
( Tanjiro yelling )

188
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,182
Tomioka: Cease this!

189
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,451
The Master will be
arriving shortly!

190
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,719
( Shinazugawa gasps )

191
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:50,356
( Singers vocalizing )

192
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,593
( Mitsuri gasps )

193
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,661
( Shinazugawa gasps )

194
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,468
( Groans )

195
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,536
( Mitsuri chuckles )

196
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,338
Pardon me.

197
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,877
Shinazugawa: Damn you.

198
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,415
Iguro: Tomioka's outburst
must have been a distraction,

199
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,084
but that boy
still managed to get a blow in.

200
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,686
If you can't tell the difference

201
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,688
between good demons
and bad ones,

202
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,691
then you shouldn't be a Hashira!

203
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:29,161
Shinazugawa:
You no-good, little...

204
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,299
I'll destroy you!

205
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,567
( Tanjiro gasping )

206
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,839
Women: The Master
of the mansion has returned.

207
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,240
( Shinobu gasps )

208
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:44,242
( Tanjiro gasps )

209
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,211
¶

210
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,453
Lord: My beloved children...

211
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:56,388
( Tanjiro gasps )

212
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,592
Lord: I thank you
for coming here this day.

213
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,900
Eturned.

214
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,163
Lord: Mmm.

215
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,035
Good morning to you all.

216
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,337
The weather
is strikingly nice today.

217
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,707
Perhaps with a blue sky?

218
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:53,511
Finding ourselves here
at the semiannual gathering

219
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,648
with all the same faces,
it brings me joy.

220
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,386
Tanjiro: So this is the Master?

221
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,054
He looks wounded.

222
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,522
No, sick, maybe.

223
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:06,191
( Gasps )

224
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:07,993
So quick!

225
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,128
I couldn't even react!

226
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:11,597
What is he--

227
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,631
( gasps )

228
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,533
¶

229
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:24,476
Shinazugawa: I am pleased

230
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:28,146
to see you in good health
as well, Master.

231
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:32,217
I fervently pray
for your continued good fortune.

232
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,653
Lord: I thank you, sanemi.

233
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,424
Mitsuri: Ohh!

234
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,994
I wanted to be the one
to welcome the Master!

235
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:45,030
Shinazugawa: If I may, Master,

236
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,433
before we start this meeting,

237
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,766
would you kindly enlighten us

238
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,702
about this young swordsman
right here,

239
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:54,440
who it would appear
has been accompanied by a demon?

240
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:58,376
Tanjiro: He didn't seem to have
any social graces before,

241
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,312
but now he's
speaking so formally.

242
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,581
Lord: But of course.

243
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:07,252
I apologize for any confusion.

244
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:11,023
Tanjiro and Nezuko
have both been sanctioned.

245
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,462
I would appreciate it if you'd
all accept this condition.

246
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,666
( Beads rattle )

247
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,335
Gyomei: Master, even though

248
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:25,603
it is something
you have requested,

249
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,806
I cannot bring myself to do it.

250
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,343
Uzui: I am also opposed to this!

251
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:35,147
A slayer traveling with a demon
is unacceptable!

252
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,548
Mitsuri: As for myself,

253
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,751
I shall do whatever it is
you wish, Master!

254
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,821
Muichiro: I'll forget, anyway,

255
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,391
so I'm fine either way.

256
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:54,700
Iguro: I won't trust them.
Absolutely not.

257
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,103
First of all, I loathe demons.

258
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:01,039
Rengoku: Although I respect you
with all my heart, Master,

259
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,708
I cannot abide by this!

260
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,243
I'm fully against it!

261
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,514
Shinazugawa: The Corps's mission
is to annihilate demons.

262
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,316
I ask that you punish
kamado and Tomioka!

263
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,323
Lord: The letter.

264
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,658
Woman: Yes, sir.

265
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:29,267
A former Hashira, Mr. Urokodaki,

266
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,538
sent along to us this letter
with a request.

267
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,674
I shall read to you
an abridged version.

268
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,411
"I ask you to allow Tanjiro

269
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:42,480
"and his sister
to accompany each other.

270
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:46,284
Because of her resilient
mental fortitude..."

271
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,287
Urokodaki: ...Nezuko has
not lost her human reason.

272
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:53,158
Even when starved,
she has never devoured a human,

273
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,294
and that is true
more than two years later.

274
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,764
Although the situation
sounds outlandish,

275
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,166
it is in fact reality.

276
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,301
In the event
that Nezuko does assault

277
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:06,772
another human being,
myself, as well as...

278
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,508
Woman: "...Tanjiro kamado
and giyu Tomioka,

279
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:12,644
will atone
by committing seppuku."

280
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,680
( Tanjiro gasps )

281
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,686
( Crying )

282
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,531
Shinazugawa: Who cares how they
choose to end their lives?

283
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,669
Fire, hanging,
it's all the same!

284
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,405
It doesn't guarantee
our safety!

285
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,474
Rengoku: Shinazugawa is right!

286
00:15:42,476 --> 00:15:45,411
If she kills a human,
we can't turn back the clock.

287
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,413
That person
will be lost forever!

288
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,617
Lord: You do have a point.

289
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,818
Shinazugawa: So, then...

290
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,486
Rengoku:
What do you wish, Master?

291
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,690
Lord: We can't guarantee
that she won't attack humans.

292
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:00,059
We can't prove it.

293
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,696
That said...

294
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:08,700
We also cannot be certain
she will attack humans.

295
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,302
( Shinazugawa gasps )

296
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:14,105
Lord: Here is what we do know
about her for certain.

297
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,775
She has been abstinent
for over two years,

298
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,243
and there are three people

299
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,046
who would vouch for her
with their lives.

300
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,516
If this evidence is rejected,
one must offer in turn

301
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,685
an even more convincing
argument.

302
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:29,788
( Shinazugawa sputters )

303
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,724
Lord: Are any of you
able to do so?

304
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,692
( Rengoku grunts )

305
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,796
Lord: Also,
there is another thing

306
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,065
I'd like to relay to you,
my children.

307
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:45,070
Tanjiro has met kibutsuji
face to face.

308
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,204
( Hashira gasp )

309
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,805
Uzui: That's impossible!

310
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,742
Not even a Hashira
has ever crossed paths with him!

311
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:53,411
- ( Mitsuri yelps )
- Uzui: Did you, really?

312
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,947
What did he look like?
What are his powers?

313
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,282
Where did you see him?

314
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,485
Muichiro: Did you fight?

315
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,619
Shinazugawa:
What was kibutsuji doing?!

316
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,422
Did you find his stronghold?!
Answer me!

317
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,092
Uzui: Shut up!
I asked him first!

318
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,627
Come on. Tell us
what powers kibutsuji has!

319
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,230
( Singers vocalize )

320
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:13,298
( Silence )

321
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,104
¶

322
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,706
Lord: Speaking of that man,

323
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:24,442
we know he has
sent pursuers after Tanjiro.

324
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:27,713
While his goal may simply be
to silence Tanjiro,

325
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:30,315
now that he has
finally revealed himself,

326
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,451
I wish to seize
on this opportunity.

327
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,722
I also believe something
is happening to Nezuko

328
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,325
that kibutsuji never saw coming.

329
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,559
( Tanjiro sighs )

330
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:44,730
Lord: Do you agree with me now?

331
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:51,069
Shinazugawa:
I'm afraid I don't, Master.

332
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,740
If it were human, there would
be no question we'd spare it,

333
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,408
but after all
we've gone through,

334
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:58,744
after losing
countless of our brethren,

335
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:01,146
asking us to house a demon,

336
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,115
it's unacceptable.

337
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:06,151
( Lord grunts )

338
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,486
( Shinazugawa grunts )

339
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,759
Mitsuri: Huh?
Wh-what is he doing?

340
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:15,160
What is he doing?

341
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,163
Not all over the garden!

342
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,965
Shinazugawa: Hear me, Master!

343
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,833
The depravity of a demon,

344
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,036
I will prove it to you,
here and now!

345
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,238
Lord: Sanemi.

346
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,709
Shinazugawa: Hey, demon,

347
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,511
it's time for your dinner.

348
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,980
Take a bite.

349
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,949
- ( Blood dripping )
- ( Tanjiro groaning )

350
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,356
( Nezuko grunting )

351
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,261
( Wood scraping )

352
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,463
Shinazugawa:
No need to hold back.

353
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:53,665
Just show us your true colors,

354
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,134
and then I'll destroy you
right here.

355
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,136
