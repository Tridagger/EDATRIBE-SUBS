Shinobu: Were you acquainted
with any of these demon slayers?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,613
There don't seem to be

4
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,150
any survivors in this area,
at least.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,886
We were informed that several
of the newer mizunoto

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,824
had joined the battle
to combat these demons, but...

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,627
They might all be dead by now,
don't you think?

8
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:31,396

Since we've been given
this joint mission,

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,906
let's try to get along, Tomioka.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,243
Tomioka: My only concern
is slaying demons.

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,646
Shinobu:
How coldhearted of you.

15
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:51,583
Well, how about
we split up from this point?

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,786
I shall proceed from the west.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,788

come near my family!

22

my techniques worked.

38

This is bad. What do I do?

40
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:38,557

Damn it!

All that force with just
a single swipe of its arm!

48

I can't beat him
in my condition.

49

about him now.

he's about to do something

finish him off!

Don't go phrasing it
in such an infantile manner.

135
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,289
The two of us are family.

136
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:14,626
We are connected

137
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:20,165
Regardless of that, this is
between me and my sister.

You're wrong.

Family or comrade, as long as
you feel close to one another,

142
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,047
that's all that really matters.

143
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,450
Saying it's childish
if you're not related by blood,

144
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,185
that's not true at all!

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,586
Not only that,

146
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,189
but those who are strongly
connected with each other

147
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,724
give off the scent of trust.

148
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,060
But all I'm picking up
from you two

149
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,795
is the scent of terror,
hatred, and revulsion!

150
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,199
That's not something
you can call a bond!

151
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:57,069

would you look at that!

157
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,485
A demon
that's a manageable size.

158
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,687
Even I can deal with a kid.

Demon slayer:
Don't move in on my prey!

162
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,563
This is how I'll secure
my path up the ladder,

163
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,764
and with more status,

164
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,101
comes more money in my pockets
from on high.

165
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,571
Even with most of my unit
wiped out, I'll dispose of him,

166
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,173
and afterwards
I'll descend the mountain

167
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,842
to claim my prize
for defeating this demon.

168
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:39,244
Take this!

I'm gonna need you to
hang in there a little longer.

183

What did you mean?

I'm not going to kill you
in a single strike.

Instead, I'll dissect you
piece by piece.
