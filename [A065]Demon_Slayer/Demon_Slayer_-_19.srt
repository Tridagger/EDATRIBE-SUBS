Incredible.

He's on a whole other level.

13
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,216
The force of his strike alone
is in a class of its own.

14
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:26,284
He cut through
that tough-as-nails monster

15
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,620
like it was tofu!

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,957

That was absolutely amazing!

Fight me, Mr. Mismatched outfit!

You beat that member

I'm gonna beat you!

Tomioka: That wasn't
one of the twelve kizuki.

32
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,534
Could you not even tell that?

33
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,870
Inosuke: Of course I could tell!
For your information,

34
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,472
it was Tanjiro who was
saying it was one of 'em!

have been one of those guys!

I see it's not just a sword
he's quick with.

Hey, you, get back here!

00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,295
you shouldn't be fighting.

Inosuke: Huh?! I can't hear you!

44
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,700
Your voice is too soft,
and you're walking too fast!

Shinobu: Are you
calling me gramps?

Zenitsu: Just now,
gramps showed up

57
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,143

not to give up ever.

Shinobu: Ah! Your life
flashed before your eyes.

59

You know,
according to one theory,

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,617
the reason you see images
like that just before death

61
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:41,686
is because you're searching
for a way to avoid death

62
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,790
by going through all your
past experiences and memories.

63
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,161
Truthfully,
I can't speak from experience,

64

65
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,968
Good. I can tell
you slowed the poison

66
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,770
by adjusting your breathing.

67
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,772
If you weren't able to do that,

68
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,174
you would have already
turned into a spider.

69
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:04,610

with the antidote now.

I can't believe it!

78
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,145
Are those threads
he's controlling even tougher

79
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,215
than that demon whose body
I couldn't cut through?

my sword is now shattered.

Now's not the time
to feel sorry for yourself.

Now's the time to think!

00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,168
If I can't cut those threads,

86
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,070
then I'll just
have to meet him head-on!

87
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,445
It's like those threads
have a life of their own

88
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,181
and are refusing
to let me get close.

89

Even though he's holding back
so as not to kill me,

90

all the same!

You refuse? Fine.

94
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,700

what your sister did,

I found it
genuinely moving to behold.

I doubt any words exist that
describe exactly how I felt.

150

However,
your fate now is death,

151
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:12,424

for you, no doubt.

So listen close.

00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:21,966
I'll impart to you
how you can escape your fate.

154
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,036
It involves your sister.

155
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,106
I want you to give her to me.

156

of being your little sister,

160
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:42,987
she's mine.

161
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,123
Tanjiro:
You don't actually think

162
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,192
I'd ever agree to that, do you?

163
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,994
First off, Nezuko's not a thing!

164
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,865
She has her own will
and feelings!

165

There's no way
she'll ever be your sister!

I'm stronger than you.

169
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,678
I will create a bond with her,
one made of terror.

170
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,013
She'll know what happens
when I'm defied.

Tanjiro: I've had enough of you
spouting this nonsense!

Using fear to keep someone
shackled to you

173
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,621
isn't the bond of a family,

174
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,758
and until you are able
to figure that out,

175
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,960
you'll never get
what it is you desire!

176
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,763
Rui: So irritating.

177
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,899

00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,311
Rui: Very well, then.

182
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,179
I'll just kill you.

183
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,516
Tanjiro: Not if I manage
to cut your head off first!

184
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,919
Rui: Now, that's the spirit.

185
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,588
I would love to see you try it.

186
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,325
Let's see if you can
take down a being like me,

187
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,526
one of the twelve kizuki.

188
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,764
I: In a family,

189
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,834
the father has
his designated role to fulfill,

190
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,972
and the mother has hers in turn.

191
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,041
The parents protect
their eldest children,

192
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:13,378
and the eldest
protect the younger ones.

193
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:16,115
This is carried out,
no matter what,

194
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,250
even at the risk
of their own lives.

195
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,520
The way I see it,

196
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,790
if you don't understand
your own role in this life,

197
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,059
there's no reason
in living it to begin with.

198
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:33,464
As for you,
I'll tell you your role.

199
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,201
It is to relinquish
your younger sister to me

200
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:37,936
and disappear.

201
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,939
If you refuse,
your only other path is death,

202
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,975
for you cannot defeat me.

203
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,946
Tanjiro: His eye
says "lower five."

204
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,548
As I thought.

205
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:52,484
This power--
he really is one of the twelve.

206
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:56,955
It won't be easy
to cut those threads,

207
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,891
but what do I do
if his neck is even tougher?

208
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,427
Not to mention my broken sword.

209
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:05,364
Rui: That steely look
in your eyes,

210
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,098
I don't like it.

211
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,967
What are you plotting?

212
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:10,235
Don't tell me...

213
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:14,105
That you think
you'll be able to defeat me!

214
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,174

215
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,376

216
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,377
Nezuko!

217
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,380
Rui: It's settled.

218
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,981
I'll be taking her.

219
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:25,450
You understand your role now,
don't you?

220
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:26,985
Tanjiro: Let her go!

221
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,854
Rui: Did I not I tell you

222
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,857
that I'd spare your life
in return for your obedience?

223
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,025
( Nezuko growls )

224
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,894

230

( Nezuko whimpers )

232
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,821
Rui: Quiet down.

233
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,023
This won't be enough
to kill her.

234
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,226
She's a demon.

235
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,429
But it does appear
I'll have to teach her a lesson.

236
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,031
I'm going to let her bleed
for a while.

237
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,767
If she won't learn
to be obedient,

238
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,437
I'll just leave her like that
until daybreak

239
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,972
and then let her burn.

240
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,708
Tanjiro: I won't allow it!

241
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,243
Let her go!

( Panting )

247
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:51,402
Rui: Now, I may be
mistaken here...

248
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,073
But you think,
if you get close enough to me,

249
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,141
you can chop my head off,
don't you?

250
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,281
Well, then, here.

251
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,382
Give it a shot.

Rui: Didn't I tell you?

257
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,201
You have no chance against me.

258
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,976
My body is more durable

259
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,179
than any of the threads
I can manipulate.

260
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,315
If you can't even cut
those threads,

261
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,118
then you'll never
be able to cut my neck.

( Thinking )
He's incredibly strong.

265
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:55,734
His strength is beyond any other
demon I've fought so far.

266
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,204
So this is the might
of the twelve kizuki,

267
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,742
the power of a demon
closely related to Kibutsuji.

268

Rui: As of today,
I'm her elder brother,

275
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,361
and I command
she cease that noise.

278
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,966
calm down. Don't get emotional.

279
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,769
If you do, you'll play
right into his hands.

( Nezuko sighs )

281
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,442
Rui: Huh? What happened to her?

282
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,978
Did she pass out?

283
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,981
This demon has a unique aura.

284
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:46,185
I haven't seen
anything quite like it.

285
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,187
Fascinating.

286
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,389
Tanjiro: Concentrate.

287
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,724
Control your breathing.

288
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,927
Unleash the most precise
final form!

289
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,130
Total concentration!

290
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,401

Tanjiro: I did it!
I cut the threads!

Rui: Gathering force
with each rotation.

297
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,492
This could be worrisome.

298
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,562
Tanjiro: If I can keep closing
the distance between us,

299
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:31,830
I can defeat him!

300
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,065

think these threads

302
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:40,239
are at maximum strength, do you?

303
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,040
Blood demon art.

304

I have no more use for you.

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,047
Farewell.

Tanjiro: Not good.

309
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:55,054
I can't get enough rotations in
to cut away these threads.

310
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,122
They're giving off
a totally different scent

311
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,790
than the other ones.

312
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,260
This can't be
how it ends, can it?

313
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,829
Am I really gonna die here?

314

Master your command over it,

That is

been pretty sick, right?

So how can he be
out in the snow

339

keep dancing and dancing?

a breathing technique,

from ever exhausting yourself.

there'll be repercussions!

363
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,114
If that happens, I'll be
rendered immobile for a time!

364
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,151
That's why
I need to keep pressing on!

365
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:43,488
Run!
You have to protect Nezuko!

366
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,357
( Yelling )

367
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:52,965
Rui: How?

368
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,442
( Thread rings )

369
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:06,044
Tanjiro: I see it,
the opening thread!

370
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,513
You have to take him down now,

371
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:13,285
even if it means
getting slashed in the process!

372
00:19:15,456 --> 00:19:18,023
Kie: Nezuko. Nezuko.

373
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,894
Wake up, Nezuko.

374
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,864
You need to save your brother.

375
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,700
You're capable of doing so.

376
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:30,202
I know you are.

377
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,011
Nezuko, help him.

378
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:43,415
Your brother will be killed
if you don't!

379
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,549

381
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,220
Nezuko: Blood demon art.

382
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,256
Exploding blood!

383
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,828
( Rui gasps )

384
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,101
Impossible!

385
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,369
The threads were burned away?

386
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,306
Tanjiro: The bond
between Nezuko and I

387
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,176
cannot be severed,
not by anyone!
