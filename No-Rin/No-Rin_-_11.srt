1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:02,965
Summer's in full swing!

2
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:05,970
We're talking puffy white clouds, cicada's buzzing,

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:07,062
the whole bit.

4
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:09,764
Nice!

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,016
Dressed to impress! That's how it's done!

6
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:16,867
This doesn't make me look dorky?

7
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:18,294
No, not at all.

8
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:22,951
Uh, excuse me.

9
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:23,731
Eh?

10
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:27,874
Well, do I look adorable or what?

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,865
You definitely look something.

12
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,079
Uh-huh. Say it. I have a glow.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,552
Or a bun in the oven.

14
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:37,490
Same thing. Wow, just imagine.

15
00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:39,920
The outfit might get people
thinking that you and me are...

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,023
Oh dear. Careful.

17
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:44,781
With a butt like that you've got to pay attention

18
00:00:44,806 --> 00:00:45,990
to your center of gravity.

19
00:00:46,073 --> 00:00:48,573
Might help a little if you didn't shove me!

20
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:53,942
Alrighty. Train's about to leave. So, yeah.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
With Kei and Yoshida doing their thing abroad

22
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,798
over the summer break,
I thought it'd fun to take Ringo along

23
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:01,515
with Minori and me for a visit back home to the boonies.

24
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:04,139
But, oh man, was there ever a perfect storm brewing.

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,974
Would I live to tell the tale?
Your guess is as good as mine!

26
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,835
The Nagaragawa Railway.

27
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:41,281
Naga Rail for short.

28
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,740
Run these days by a third-tier public transit company,

29
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,833
it picks up where the old Etsumi South Line left off.

30
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:51,410
Okay, this rice is perfect for mealtime

31
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:52,615
on the rails.

32
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,282
Mm. Very tasty.

33
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,533
So, uh, exactly how far out is your hometown?

34
00:02:57,656 --> 00:02:59,287
Oh, it's in the middle of nowhere.

35
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,563
But, Minori's family's nice.

36
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,939
Give Ringo the rundown on your three sisters.

37
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,657
Tsukasa's the oldest, then I came along.

38
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,208
The two youngest are twins: Takumi and Akin.

39
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:10,204
Cool.

40
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:13,031
Ah, Tsukasa. Hey, uh...

41
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:15,620
So she moved back home not that long ago, right?

42
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:16,906
What was she doing?

43
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,545
Ahh... Little of this, little of that.

44
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,570
You know, whatever keeps a gal like her busy.

45
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:22,715
Heh. Guess the old crowd

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,595
didn't nickname her "The General" for nothing.

47
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:26,406
It's weird she came back, though.

48
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,785
Figured she'd still be out there blazing a trail.

49
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,573
Uh-oh. Stay still!

50
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,548
So... Some special reason he's along for the ride?

51
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,653
Gee. I don't know, uh...

52
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,040
Little fella gets super lonely when you're not around,

53
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:45,140
and he's got kind of a sixth sense for where you are.

54
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
Whatever. You're keeping tabs on him, though.

55
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:49,719
Far as this trip's concerned, he's your mess.

56
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:52,548
Mm-hmm! In you go, love.

57
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:53,905
Make yourself at home.

58
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:59,011
Uh. Okay. What the...?

59
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:01,307
I made a special pouch for him in there.

60
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:04,319
Awkward. Now you really do look preggers.

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,553
Attention passengers,

62
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,396
if you peek out your window right now,

63
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,507
you'll see we're passing over
the First Nagara River Bridge.

64
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:20,641
So cool.

65
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,146
Check it out, they're waving! Ha!

66
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,741
C'mon, you too.

67
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:31,311
Uh, okay.

68
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,259
Hello!

69
00:04:35,136 --> 00:04:36,156
Hey, Kousaku?

70
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:37,076
Huh?

71
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,266
You know... I've been on my share of trains and stuff,

72
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:44,705
but this one's probably my favorite.

73
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:49,919
Next stop, Aioi.

74
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:53,366
Thank you for choosing Nagaragawa Railway.

75
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,156
We hope you have a pleasant day.

76
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:00,195
Where's the attendant?

77
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,616
Oh there isn't one. The station's unmanned.

78
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:09,679
Bubba! Sissy!

79
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,906
Welcome back!

80
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,580
Taku and Aki!

81
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:15,746
Someone's been eating their vegetables!

82
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,698
Hey! How come Sissy's got such a big tummy?

83
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:20,281
Now, now. Don't poke.

84
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,048
She's carrying precious cargo in there,

85
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,719
not just her usual roll of fat.

86
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,478
Ha! Well, well!

87
00:05:25,503 --> 00:05:27,198
You just couldn't stay away, huh?

88
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,713
Oh, hey Tsukasa!

89
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:31,605
Whoa! We're getting a ride from The General herself?

90
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,365
You eat a watermelon on the train?

91
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:34,134
Wait...

92
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:37,144
Am I crazy or is the middle
child sporting a motherly glow?

93
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:39,240
Knock if off, Sis. Jeepers.

94
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:41,465
You're going to embarrass me in front of everybody.

95
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,823
Don't be so self-conscious.
You look absolutely fabulous.

96
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:46,046
Thank you.

97
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,697
You've filled out a bit, too, Kousaku.

98
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:49,670
How're things?

99
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,823
Finer than frog hair split four ways.

100
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:52,845
Frog hair?

101
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,115
Oh, country-folk jibber-jab.
Welcome to the sticks, Ringo.

102
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:58,656
This is how we do. No standing on ceremony.

103
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,346
You'll be just fine.

104
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:02,614
How do you know my name?

105
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:05,615
Ha! We're all up in everybody's business here.

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,747
Right. Load up and climb in!
Time's wasting, fam's waiting.

107
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:12,178
Heh. Tiger gets shotgun.

108
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:25,964
Seriously?

109
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:29,554
Aunt Hisako, Uncle Kiichi. What are we doing here again?

110
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:31,656
Exchanging engagement gifts!

111
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,698
Oh, yeah? Who's engaged?

112
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:37,384
Good one. You and Minori, my boy!

113
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,323
Sister. I thank you. My heart...

114
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,906
Miiinoooriii!!

115
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,173
Sorry, the jig is up! I get why you dragged me out here!

116
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:55,031
Wakadana has a sixth sense, huh?
Oh-ho, motherly glow, eh?

117
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,490
You are absolutely the worst kind of person!

118
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,340
Darling, please, save it for later!

119
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:02,314
No time like the present for truth!

120
00:07:03,573 --> 00:07:04,073
Minori!

121
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,814
What in heaven's name is that?!

122
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,961
It's a wallaby from school!

123
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,287
But she?

124
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,616
Young lady! What is the meaning of this?

125
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,131
I caved under the pressure

126
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:25,746
to give you grandchildren, okay?!

127
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,063
I see what you did there.

128
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,198
Let me give you some sisterly advice, Hondo.

129
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,073
Next time you want us all to think you're expecting

130
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:35,448
a visit from the stork, make sure the proud papa-to-be

131
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:38,215
is in on the scam. You know this is pathetic, right?

132
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,940
Yeah...

133
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:47,621
Well, what I'd like to know is how you
all fell for it in the first place!

134
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,736
I mean, how could you possibly think
me and her were going to be parents?

135
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:52,969
How gullible can you be?

136
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,197
Sorry! Never mind about that!

137
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:58,881
The thing is, though... What's the big rush?

138
00:07:58,906 --> 00:07:59,788
Kousaku.

139
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:00,348
Ma'am?

140
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:03,191
Here's the deal.
I'm getting a non-profit off the ground.

141
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,816
This here town needs it.

142
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:07,058
Uh... Oh yeah?

143
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:09,522
We're calling it "Turn A!"

144
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,490
Do what now?

145
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,418
In city talk, coming back to the country

146
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,558
is a U-turn, or, sometimes, an I-turn.

147
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:15,990
But I'm thinking alpha.

148
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,237
A-turn is sort of clumsy in practice, though.

149
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,198
So I "turned it around" and there you have it:

150
00:08:20,281 --> 00:08:24,197
coming back to your roots!
See, "A" also stands for Aioi!

151
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,198
Deal is, the town's about to
put on it's first full-fledged

152
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:30,281
Turn-A extravaganza.

153
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:31,906
I banked on you two getting hitched

154
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,631
being the big draw that brings in the crowds.

155
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:35,227
Huh? How so?

156
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,140
A mixer?

157
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,490
You bet! Two hundred upwardly mobile singles

158
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:45,365
mingling together over country-fried hors d'oeuvres

159
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:46,740
right here in Aioi!

160
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:47,710
Hm!

161
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,865
And you two were gonna be the big focus.

162
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:53,073
Young couple in love makes good
-our own farm-raised success!

163
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:53,906
Couple?

164
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,615
In love?

165
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:55,698
Whoaaa!

166
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:57,906
You first locked eyes in Aioi.

167
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,740
married in Aioi, live in Aioi, work and play in Aioi,

168
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,156
and are about to be one baby
into rearing a family in Aioi.

169
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,406
You two'll be the ideal PR centerpiece

170
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,580
for what this mixer's meant to accomplish!

171
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,548
I've got morning sickness.

172
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:14,906
Here's the plan, chief:

173
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,323
you're going to get my sister in a family way, pronto.

174
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:20,353
You're practically engaged as it
is, so what the hey, right?

175
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:21,173
Yes!

176
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:23,031
Come on, boy! Think of the village!

177
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:24,240
The village!

178
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:26,573
This is crazy! How am I supposed to just... ?

179
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:29,073
Look, kid: we borrowed a lot
of dough to make this happen.

180
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,615
If the mixer gets called off,
we're a million in the hole.

181
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:34,698
In other words, I'd be happy to
help my community any way I can.

182
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,048
Yeah! Let's get this party started!

183
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,156
Yeah!

184
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,821
We'll seal your engagement

185
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,090
at the community center!

186
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:42,785
Young couple!

187
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,549
Young love!

188
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,114
This is gonna be great!

189
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,740
We're going to be so friggin' happy!

190
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,240
Man, what a crazy day.

191
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,250
Um, where's Ringo?

192
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,814
I put her up in the guestroom. Poor dear was exhausted.

193
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:18,976
I'll bet.

194
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,782
Guess today was a pretty big shock to her system, too.

195
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,552
Don't worry, though. I've got a bed ready for you.

196
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:26,152
Yeah?

197
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,431
Takes you back, doesn't it? In you go!

198
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:37,563
Crap!

199
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:39,715
Sweet dreams, future son-in-law!

200
00:10:39,837 --> 00:10:43,167
You locked the door? What if I have to pee?

201
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:49,173
Memory lane, huh?

202
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:52,030
Remember back in the day how you'd always wet the bed?

203
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,031
Gee, thanks.

204
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,073
Damn. Should've known. Towns like this...

205
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,423
There's nothing they won't do to counteract

206
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,615
the declining birthrate!

207
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm essentially breeding stock to these people!

208
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,088
So, uh, you know...

209
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,071
I have kind of a suggestion
to make if you're open to it.

210
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,120
It's actually a swell idea.

211
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,085
Oh, yeah? Go on.

212
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:14,965
Well, uh... If you... I mean, you and me...

213
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,174
Made, you know, like a baby...
My folks would get off our back.

214
00:11:19,323 --> 00:11:19,865
So...?

215
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:20,448
What?

216
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:21,249
What?!

217
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,162
What?!!

218
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,073
Just think about it for a sec.

219
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:25,323
They're really only rushing us

220
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,083
'cause there ain't no babies around.

221
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,813
If we got started making them one,

222
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,801
they'd change their tune in a heartbeat, right?

223
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:32,756
Yeah! Not the problem! Forget it!

224
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:34,406
That is not a viable solution, period!

225
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,340
Aw, c'mon, Kousaku! You like kids, don't you?

226
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,584
Yeah? Don't be a grump.

227
00:11:39,892 --> 00:11:40,703
Look at you.

228
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,448
You'd be a great dad and you know it.

229
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:45,073
In fact, our kid'd probably be your spitting image.

230
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,205
Wouldn't that be super-duper cute?

231
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:48,907
You're... You're serious.

232
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,040
Of course I am.

233
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,698
Hey, remember when your parents first brought you over?

234
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:54,746
We were little.

235
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,398
I can see it like it was yesterday.

236
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,655
There you were, hiding behind your mom and dad,

237
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,526
not looking up at me even once.

238
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:04,167
What did you expect? I was scared.

239
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,442
We'd just up and moved on a whim.

240
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:08,744
I had no idea what was going on.

241
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,990
I know. It's just...

242
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:13,240
The expression on your face always stuck with me,

243
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:16,390
kind of like you were halfway
between tears and a tantrum.

244
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,567
See, I knew right then that I
could never leave you alone.

245
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,781
You need me.

246
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:25,161
Or someone, at least. Might as well be me.

247
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:27,285
Thing is, I want to be there for you.

248
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:32,585
Look... We... I...

249
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,615
Bubba!

250
00:12:37,698 --> 00:12:38,480
Bubba!

251
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,139
Sissy!

252
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,237
We want to sleep here with you tonight!

253
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:43,406
Uh... Sure! Why not? Eh?

254
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,363
Yeah! Cool beans! We'll have a slumber party.

255
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,698
Just like the old days.

256
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,156
Yay!

257
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:20,858
Good morning.

258
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,588
Good morning, my darling Koutan!

259
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,923
Back after while, Tsukasa and me

260
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:29,656
are making arrangements for the wedding.

261
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,377
Your Loving Wife.

262
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:34,590
The-They're really going to go
through with this, aren't they?!

263
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:35,531
Morning.

264
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,865
Oh, hey! Morning!

265
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:39,532
Did, uh, you sleep okay?

266
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,485
Where's the gang?

267
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,434
Huh? Oh. The day starts super early on a farm.

268
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,181
Hey, uh.

269
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,582
What would you say to me giving you a little tour?

270
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:53,081
Cool.

271
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,365
Everybody's so hard at work already.

272
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:05,573
If there's one hard and fast rule in the country,

273
00:14:05,656 --> 00:14:07,989
it's get your work in while the weather's nice.

274
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,290
Uncle Kiichi lives by that.

275
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:12,590
He's always the first one up.

276
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:15,386
Also the last guy to call it a day.

277
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:20,156
One of his prize-winning tomatoes. Here, try a bite.

278
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,207
Good, right?

279
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:30,990
He uses a special technique and everything.

280
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,833
Too bad he won't be able to pass
it down to future generations.

281
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,454
Wait. He can't?

282
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,285
Not a lot of people left in rural places

283
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,115
like this. The old ways have been on the down swing

284
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,434
for a while now.

285
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,100
I wonder...

286
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:48,221
What do you think came first, the chicken or the egg?

287
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,698
Are people leaving 'cause farming's not popular,

288
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:52,156
or is it the other way around?

289
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,297
Maybe farming's losing its appeal for people

290
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:56,698
'cause so many farmers are calling it quits?

291
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:00,749
If there was a way to make it all attractive again,

292
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:03,823
people would start moving back
out to the country in droves.

293
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,235
Make farming attractive.

294
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,740
That must be what Tsukasa is trying to get at.

295
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:15,035
Can't really blame the girl for trying, huh?

296
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,806
You know Kiichi's oldest daughter?

297
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:19,698
Well, just like that, she's back,

298
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,156
stirring up all manner of heaven only knows what.

299
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,180
That's the union chief and the mayor.

300
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:25,608
Oh, I heard.

301
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:28,115
"The General" thinks she can
bring in a lot of new blood.

302
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,882
Like they won't pick up and
leave at first sign of trouble.

303
00:15:31,062 --> 00:15:32,573
Remember that family came up from the city

304
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:35,331
once upon a time? Hata, I think the name was?

305
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:36,951
It'll be that all over again.

306
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:39,186
What's the verdict on Kiichi's girl?

307
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:40,672
She abandoned ship once.

308
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,981
Stands to reason she'll do it again.

309
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,240
Guarantee you her enthusiasm won't survive the month.

310
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,862
Well now, if you ask me, that's being right generous.

311
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,061
What did they mean "it'll be that all over again?"

312
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:00,729
Kousaku, I want to see your house.

313
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,557
I'm talking to you!

314
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,156
There's nothing to see.

315
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:11,115
It's there, it's just not a house anymore.

316
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:13,729
Wait, what?

317
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:15,990
What do you mean?

318
00:16:19,068 --> 00:16:20,668
Can we not go there, please?

319
00:16:21,031 --> 00:16:22,516
It's not a pleasant story.

320
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:25,562
Jerk.

321
00:16:26,521 --> 00:16:27,087
Uh?

322
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:28,490
Jerk.

323
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:29,613
Huh?

324
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,122
So Minori would know what you were talking about.

325
00:16:33,365 --> 00:16:35,030
But you won't "go there" with me?

326
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:37,220
It's totally unfair.

327
00:16:47,888 --> 00:16:50,477
My parents got the farming bug when I was little.

328
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,490
Thought it was the end all be all.

329
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:54,740
One day they just up and moved here.

330
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,545
Hauled stakes from the big city with me in tow.

331
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,448
Only took them a season to figure out

332
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,781
they'd bitten off more than they could chew.

333
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:03,781
What happened?

334
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:05,467
In so many words...

335
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,609
The tomato crop they were banking on failed.

336
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:12,039
Put 'em in so much,
debt they couldn't get out from under it.

337
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:15,422
To make ends meet, Mom took a part-time job.

338
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:17,656
Dad was always off somewhere away from home

339
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,365
trying to scare up capital.

340
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:27,617
That was the big irony.

341
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,448
The more they tried to salvage the farm,

342
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,880
the less they could be here to tend the damn thing.

343
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:34,210
When Mom buckled under the stress

344
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,323
and had a nervous breakdown,
Dad travelled further and further

345
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,073
away from home to try to scrounge up money

346
00:17:39,156 --> 00:17:40,375
for medical bills.

347
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:43,605
Eventually I saw him less and less, until...

348
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:45,973
Till what?

349
00:17:49,662 --> 00:17:51,374
Till the morning Mom's poor old heart

350
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,401
finally gave out.

351
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,567
That's when Dad said to hell with the farm

352
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:59,156
and left Aioi for good. Haven't seen him since.

353
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,727
Yeah, so... In come Uncle Kiichi and Auntie Hisako,

354
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:06,264
who took me under their wing an raised me as their own.

355
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,824
And Minori?

356
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:08,663
Huh?

357
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,152
Wha-What is she to you?

358
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:15,858
Well. I...

359
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,152
Bubba! Whatcha doin'?

360
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:20,656
Showing my pal Ringo here the sights.

361
00:18:20,846 --> 00:18:22,788
This is the best view in the village.

362
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:25,865
I want to show you how many exercise stamps

363
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,198
I've collected!

364
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:29,156
Me, too! Look, I have a whole big bunch!

365
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,234
Good morning.

366
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,740
Hm? Hey.

367
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:34,744
Come on, where are your manners, guys?

368
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:38,252
Ah... Are you a princess?

369
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,047
'Cause you... you look like one.

370
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:43,307
Yeah.

371
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,673
Seriously?

372
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:45,501
How come?

373
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:48,237
Why's a real, live princess
staying in a house like ours?

374
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:49,563
Oh, uh...

375
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,722
It's summer vacation.

376
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,385
Princesses get summer vacation, too?

377
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,156
Mm-hmm.

378
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,819
Wait, but... What country are you princess of?

379
00:18:56,987 --> 00:19:00,323
It's, uh... It's called Yukatania.

380
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,294
Where's that?

381
00:19:03,531 --> 00:19:05,297
Well it's kind of in the heart of your awesome

382
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:06,615
grown-up friend here.

383
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,322
Do you have, like, a job there and stuff?

384
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:13,323
I'm responsible for all the cuteness.

385
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:18,031
Can I be the person who carries the back of your dress

386
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:18,808
when you walk?

387
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,090
Me, too! Me, too!

388
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:21,917
I can't think of anybody better.

389
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,411
Yay!

390
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,965
Your Highness! You have to see something really cool!

391
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,705
Watermelon!

392
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,825
Whoa, hold up.

393
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,819
The little ones have sure taken a shine to our guest.

394
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:58,779
She's a princess!

395
00:19:58,804 --> 00:19:59,972
We're her retainers!

396
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:00,970
Is that a fact now?

397
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:02,832
Hey, uh, when you're done with that,

398
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:04,598
I'd love to show you a sending off.

399
00:20:05,158 --> 00:20:06,118
A what?

400
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:10,693
So where are we going?

401
00:20:10,898 --> 00:20:11,732
To the river.

402
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:13,298
What's there to do down there?

403
00:20:13,323 --> 00:20:16,039
What's there to do? Float paper lanterns downstream!

404
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,781
It's a "Sending Off" ceremony!

405
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,187
Let me! I want to put one in by myself!

406
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:25,612
Me, too!

407
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:26,840
Now, now kiddos.

408
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,620
Careful where you step. Don't fall in.

409
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,740
I've got this, thank you.

410
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,489
Now, the important part: Say goodbye to your ancestors.

411
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,523
They gotta hear you.

412
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,329
Safe journey!

413
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:57,448
Wow...

414
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,575
We can move to a better spot if you want.

415
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,770
I know a place with a way better view.

416
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,229
Gorgeous!

417
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:13,698
Cool. Thought you'd like it.

418
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:15,946
Do the lanterns make it to the ocean?

419
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,441
Nah. There's a big net just after the bend.

420
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:20,529
They'll collect them all tomorrow morning.

421
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,656
Sorry. Kind of takes the magic out of it, huh?

422
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,198
No, not really.

423
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,666
That's country life.

424
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:37,127
The real magic is in seeing it from far away.

425
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,298
Close up, sometimes it's easy to feel like an outsider,

426
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:41,965
hard to know where you fit in.

427
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:45,791
Sorry I got all weird with you about my folks...

428
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,490
I should've told you before.

429
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:48,836
I wonder.

430
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,758
It's tough here.

431
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:53,035
And I know farming's not for everyone.

432
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:54,819
But... so what?

433
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:58,007
Give me this view and the clean air any day.

434
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:02,534
The water's fresh, the mountains are
close, and the food is delicious.

435
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:06,789
Plus any village that raised you must be wonderful.

436
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:17,281
<i> Now that summer's here our hearts indulge the weather </i>

437
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:22,281
<i> Quietly we sit together, </i>

438
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:26,708
<i> Our hands entwined, the stars up above; </i>

439
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:32,226
<i> Oh, please let me be selfish, my love. </i>

440
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:36,770
<i> Let me see desire move you </i>

441
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:41,428
<i> When you glimpse me in my brand new </i>

442
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:45,990
<i> bathing suit, pool side </i>

443
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:52,041
<i> Instead of this uniform... why hide? </i>

444
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:56,448
<i> This moment's for you and me, </i>

445
00:22:56,531 --> 00:23:01,448
<i> So before we say goodbye </i>

446
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:05,698
<i> Let me lay bare what I need courage to share </i>

447
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:09,318
<i> With a special guy... </i>

448
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:16,198
<i> Timidly on my cell phone... </i>

449
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,679
Just so you know, that was me.

450
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:33,156
Not Yuka Kusakabe... But the real me.

451
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:37,960
Everybody's No-Rin.
