1
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:04,184
Hello again.

2
00:00:04,364 --> 00:00:09,117
Our story today begins a little while after
Ringo transferred to "Tamo No-Rin High."

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,796
Seriously, slow down, you're stressing me out here!

4
00:00:21,463 --> 00:00:24,404
Geez. Not like we have anywhere important to be.

5
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:34,868
Life likes to surprise us sometimes.

6
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:37,030
Just when we think we're comfortable.

7
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,244
Bam: Game Changer.

8
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,959
And all we can do is stand there and take the moment in.

9
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:16,228
We've been terrorized!

10
00:02:16,482 --> 00:02:18,063
Ugh. What a nightmare.

11
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,110
Maybe someone should call the police?

12
00:02:20,137 --> 00:02:22,365
Had a feeling this would happen one of these days.

13
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,199
There's not even a fence,

14
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,993
this field's completely vulnerable!

15
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:27,555
Did anybody here happen to see who did this?

16
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:28,810
If so, speak!

17
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,515
I saw it.

18
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:35,421
Yes. The perpetrator of this foul deed was a child.

19
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,179
Child?

20
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,992
He was wearing a grey coat or some such thing,

21
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,766
running off with his arms filled with our vegetables.

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,068
Wait. What time would you say this happened?

23
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,785
I believe it was yesterday evening on my way back home,

24
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,253
after I finished feeding the cows.

25
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:49,444
I would say it was a touch after eight o'clock.

26
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:51,366
The fiend dropped this.

27
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,349
It would seem you're telling the truth.

28
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,766
The question is: what are you planning to do?

29
00:02:56,982 --> 00:02:59,676
If it was a child,
then you have to impartially investigate

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,203
the facts and figure out his motives.

31
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,532
Yes. We have to figure out what happened fast!

32
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:05,424
Do you think it's possible the boy did this

33
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,516
'cause he's starving?

34
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,970
Please, sir. Please, may I have some more?

35
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:10,994
Aah! Don't you people get it?!

36
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,324
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

37
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,421
these kids will keep coming around and eating all our
vegetables, willy-nilly, with no consequences at all!

38
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,516
Hey, you guys!

39
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,474
The adults are talking, Minori!

40
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:21,016
In case you haven't noticed,

41
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:23,393
I am attempting to prevent what
could become a major crisis!

42
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:24,605
You know. It could've been a monkey.

43
00:03:25,432 --> 00:03:26,392
A what?

44
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:28,849
I'm picking up a monkey vibe, aren't you?

45
00:03:28,932 --> 00:03:30,891
This has monkey written all over it.

46
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:33,693
You're wrong! He was walking on two legs!

47
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:35,474
Wild monkeys may not be able to walk for miles

48
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,224
upright like that, but they can do it!

49
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:38,391
That's true. I've seen them run off

50
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:40,096
with whole watermelons before.

51
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:42,224
Wait. You've seen this with your own two eyes?!

52
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,766
Minori and I are seriously from

53
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:46,088
the middle of nowhere,
so we saw crazy stuff all the time.

54
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,307
Dogs, monkeys, pheasants. You name it.

55
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,580
What is this? Japanese folk hour?

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,391
Oh, man. I'm just glad there wasn't a starving orphan.

57
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,325
Okay, everyone, we're done!

58
00:03:58,884 --> 00:03:59,984
What's going on?

59
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:03,398
Oh. We're just thinking we're
in for a bit of a battle here.

60
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:06,932
Let's do this.

61
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,174
All right.

62
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,932
Welcome to the first ever "A Monkey Showed Up

63
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,910
and We're in a Jam, So Now We Have To Come Up

64
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:16,141
With Some Countermeasures" meeting.

65
00:04:19,155 --> 00:04:21,682
Now. Why don't we all take turns making suggestions?

66
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,891
Oooh! Kei! Pick me first!

67
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:32,883
Back where I come from, if we want to keep varmints

68
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:34,449
from treating our crops like a buffet,

69
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:35,691
we build an electric fence.

70
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,974
Yeah, but... Couldn't the animals get hurt?

71
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,699
It'll shock them, but they won't die.

72
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:41,990
Yes! Commence fence building at once!

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,031
Hmm...

74
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:45,407
While the idea itself isn't all that bad,

75
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,806
I'm afraid it's impractical.

76
00:04:47,182 --> 00:04:48,479
Yeah, why's that?

77
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:52,324
We're flat broke.

78
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:53,542
That sucks.

79
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,988
He's clearly hungry, so why don't we just feed him?

80
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,121
Huh?

81
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:06,557
It does seem like the humane thing to do.

82
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:07,844
I get it now.

83
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:10,074
You're saying if we stuff his belly till he can't eat

84
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,474
another bite, then he won't need
to mess up our fields anymore

85
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,116
and we can get back to business as usual!

86
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:17,063
That is the greatest idea of all time!

87
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:19,407
Not bad, but there's only one problem.

88
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,616
The food supply isn't his only target.

89
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,377
He's been ransacking our potted plants as well.

90
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:27,558
It seems pretty obvious to me
the beast is doing this for fun,

91
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,375
so I'm not so sure a full belly will stop him.

92
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,944
So much for that!

93
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:39,126
Listen up.

94
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,254
I've spent my whole life battling these monkeys.

95
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,766
I know where their weaknesses lie.

96
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,995
Sheer brute force is the only
way to stop these evil bastards.

97
00:05:46,048 --> 00:05:48,915
Behold! I give you Super Hitoshi, with thirty times

98
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,850
the power of the old Hitoshi,
a weapon guaranteed to blow

99
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,807
his monkey butt back to the jungle!

100
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,270
Oh my. That's an awful big gun you have!

101
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,616
This bad boy can launch up to

102
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,891
thirty fireworks simultaneously!

103
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:13,223
What the heck? Well, that's weird.

104
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,349
Maybe the gunpowder's wet or something.

105
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,766
Here, let me take a look.

106
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:28,849
Kids, believe me when I tell you this.

107
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:31,324
It's never a good idea to stare
down the barrel of a loaded gun.

108
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,435
Who's idea was this?!

109
00:06:33,657 --> 00:06:34,441
Poop.

110
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,669
Because you have all failed miserably,

111
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,682
I will now unveil to you my super secret plan!

112
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:42,650
All right then. Spill the beans.

113
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,391
Listen, Vulgarians.

114
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:52,804
As you know, humans and monkeys are both primates.

115
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,032
If we deal with this rationally,
I think you'll see that...

116
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:56,215
Hell no!

117
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,349
Uh. Whatever. It was ingenious.

118
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:01,259
You can't deny humans and monkeys are both primates.

119
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:02,254
Hunter?

120
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,540
Yes. He's just one monkey.

121
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,766
It's not like a whole army.

122
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:07,870
We should be able to dispose of it easily.

123
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:09,229
Dispose?

124
00:07:10,484 --> 00:07:13,266
Uh. Kei. I know we've got to put a stop to this,

125
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,657
but won't you feel bad about having the monkey killed?

126
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,641
Farming is a brutal business.

127
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:18,500
Truth is...

128
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,081
I'm prepared to do whatever it
takes to solve this problem.

129
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:24,181
Ah. Yeah, okay...

130
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,016
As a matter of fact, I know a skilled hunter.

131
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,939
He's just the man for the job.

132
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:35,917
Hello. My name's Ohmori.

133
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,866
Wow. Guy's a total creeper.

134
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:43,032
Whoa! Keep those thoughts to yourself!

135
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,876
No, she's right, the man's a troll.

136
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,989
Hey! Did you not hear what I just said?!

137
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,616
Surely this isn't your man.

138
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:50,241
You claimed you knew a skilled hunter.

139
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,310
I'll wager the only skill this man possesses

140
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,016
is finding the nearest box of snack cakes.

141
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,787
People are only 90% looks.

142
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,875
Which means there's 10% of them
that'll take you by surprise.

143
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,089
Ohmori might be large. But he's large and in charge.

144
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,557
And he's a blowgun pro!

145
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,364
You got to be kidding me!

146
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:09,907
Oh no. It's no joke. It's real.
Yours truly is the founder

147
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,056
of the Ohmori School of Blowgun Arts.

148
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:13,571
That's not weird.

149
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,391
Okay then.

150
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:17,692
If you're a master, where are your blowguns?

151
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,620
Right here.

152
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,223
Huh?

153
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,224
Seriously? Those are your blowguns?

154
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,501
They're my super stealthy sniper blowguns.

155
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:28,973
"Sniper blowguns?"

156
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:30,891
Right. Of course they are.

157
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,695
Didn't mean to doubt you or anything, it's just,

158
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,574
when I first saw them,
I kind of thought they looked a bit

159
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,724
like anime wall scrolls.

160
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,461
Oh. Actually, that's precisely what they are.

161
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,012
Huh?

162
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,766
These puppies make decent blowguns

163
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,432
if you remove the thumb tacks, take them off your wall,

164
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:43,315
and roll them up.

165
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,266
Uh, yeah, I can see they do.

166
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,599
So, Mr. Ohmori, if you don't mind me asking,

167
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:49,949
with your homemade blow dart wall scroll guns,

168
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,390
what do you typically hunt?

169
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,565
Just the occasional real-lifer.

170
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:57,733
Neat. Swell. So, I got to ask this.

171
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:58,846
Your job?

172
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:01,241
I mean, when you're not out
there tracking down real-lifers.

173
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,198
Do you have a job that pays you money?

174
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,749
I'm unemployed!

175
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:17,991
This potent little narcotic will send even
the heartiest of knuckle-dragging primates

176
00:09:18,104 --> 00:09:21,217
on a one-way trip to "Monkey
Heaven", if you catch my drift.

177
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,474
It's name? Well, if I told you, I'd have to kill you.

178
00:09:29,128 --> 00:09:29,812
Look!

179
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:35,601
I mastered my dart gun technique

180
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,688
by sucking on pasta several hours a day.

181
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,263
I call this specific blowing method the "deep throat."

182
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,643
Cool name.

183
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,619
It's the throat. You have to keep it relaxed.

184
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,699
I don't want to know!

185
00:09:53,724 --> 00:09:54,205
Come on!

186
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:58,224
All right! Time to show this
monkey whose turf this really is!

187
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,911
Yeah, spank that monkey!

188
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,775
Poor thing. He's hurt.

189
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,007
Kousaku?

190
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:20,764
No, Ringo, I'm sorry. But we can't show him mercy.

191
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:22,133
He's right.

192
00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:25,201
Our responsibility is to protect these fields.

193
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,081
I know not how this vile beast was separated

194
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,747
from his tribe, nor do I know why he has invaded

195
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,989
our grasslands, but I do know this:

196
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,074
The time to consider the manner
of his disposal is upon us.

197
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:47,643
Maybe try not to sound so excited about it.

198
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,807
Oh, Kei, what a fool thou art!

199
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,203
I take no pleasure in killing
beasts, only in caging them!

200
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:55,956
I have a dear friend who works at the zoo.

201
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,612
I've requested that a comfortable dwelling

202
00:10:57,637 --> 00:10:58,657
be prepared for him.

203
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,910
I'm a bit surprised. That's very kind.

204
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:02,165
You see...

205
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:04,924
Currently, they only house female monkeys at this zoo,

206
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,828
so when he joins them,
he'll be in "Monkey Heaven" in the best way.

207
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,449
He'll perform husbandly duties
and live life like a king.

208
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,110
Wow. What a relief!

209
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,499
This will give a whole new meaning to the
phrase, "monkey see, monkey do!"

210
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:17,936
Great plan. Thanks. I owe you for this one!

211
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,557
Charitable deeds done in the name of
self-gratification or seeking attention

212
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:23,182
are not genuinely charitable deeds!

213
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,516
I did what I did for the monkey and the monkey alone!

214
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:27,897
I do not require your "thank you", thank you.

215
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,057
I was right.

216
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:44,914
Coming!

217
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:48,760
Hey, Kousaku, what's up?

218
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,891
Mind if I come in for a second?

219
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:52,805
There's something we need to talk about.

220
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,224
Uh, come back in one hour, please!

221
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,619
Uh... Actually now would be better.

222
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,062
But this is very last minute and I have so many things

223
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,641
I need to get ready. Just, uh, wait right there.

224
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,173
One hour?

225
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,157
All set!

226
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:13,424
Can I come in now?

227
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:22,141
Yes. I want you to come inside.

228
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,883
Did you redecorate or something?

229
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,862
Yes. I did. But there's no need to be nervous.

230
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,646
Would you like to take a hot shower?

231
00:12:28,671 --> 00:12:30,116
Uh. No, I'm okay.

232
00:12:30,141 --> 00:12:31,366
You filthy boy.

233
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:33,436
So, you'd rather do it down and dirty then?!

234
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,553
Kei. You're here!

235
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:36,553
Wait. Kei?

236
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,463
Yeah, I invited him to join us. Come on in!

237
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:41,180
Thanks for having me...  Whoa!

238
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:43,366
She just redecorated her room.

239
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,057
This was our moment.

240
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:45,702
I really thought it was...

241
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,883
Uh... Yeah. I see that.

242
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:49,430
So, what's up?

243
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,016
You wanted to talk about something?

244
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,779
Oh. Right. It's about Ringo, actually.

245
00:12:56,849 --> 00:12:57,413
Goodnight.

246
00:12:57,513 --> 00:12:57,974
What?

247
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:58,581
Die!

248
00:12:58,699 --> 00:12:59,699
Why are you freaking out?

249
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:01,467
I haven't even given you the details yet!

250
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,991
Die in a fire and rot in hell!

251
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,991
Rude. You don't even know what I'm going to say!

252
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:07,266
Man. She's gonna stab you one of these days.

253
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:09,709
How come?! Whatever, I'm done trying to figure it out,

254
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:10,745
just look at this.

255
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:15,057
All right! Here we go. Sing along with me, you guys!

256
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:18,181
Oh, cool. This is a Yuka Kusakabe DVD.

257
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:20,257
I thought I threw those things away,

258
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:22,449
but I guess someone had a secret stash.

259
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,809
I used my allowance and bought some replacements.

260
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:26,599
Anyway, take a good look at Yukatan.

261
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:28,182
Notice anything strange?

262
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,766
♪

263
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:33,116
Well. This may seem pretty obvious.

264
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:34,729
But she's acting so friendly.

265
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:38,016
The Kinoshita I know doesn't have
a happy bone in her entire body.

266
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:40,796
He's right. She's so smiley it's weird.

267
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,716
Bingo!

268
00:13:42,307 --> 00:13:43,974
This is all about her smile.

269
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:47,519
Think about it for a minute,
the girl hasn't smiled once since she got here.

270
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,766
She didn't crack a smile in her first class.

271
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,932
She didn't so much as smirk
during the whole panties thing,

272
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:54,157
or during dinner. Or during the king game,

273
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:56,224
or when she survived the contest with Minori.

274
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:58,677
Not even when the damn monkey's life was saved.

275
00:13:58,849 --> 00:13:59,412
That's true.

276
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,307
But her happiness here could
just be part of her act, right?

277
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:03,489
You may be onto something.

278
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:04,641
But still...

279
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:06,048
There's a person living with us who is so down

280
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:08,634
they never smile at all. Don't you think that's sad?

281
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,724
Yeah. Actually, it really is.

282
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:11,907
I know, right?

283
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:15,016
If you need smiles. Then have no fear.

284
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,876
The comedy cavalry has arrived!

285
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:23,726
Fancy running into you here. Kinoshita.

286
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:27,251
Anyway... How would you feel about
watching me perform a little trick?

287
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,578
Dark matter!

288
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:38,190
And?

289
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,564
Looks like we're going to have to step it up a notch!

290
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,832
Well, hello!

291
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,766
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle, tickle...

292
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,682
Minori! Damn you for making me jealous right now!

293
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,273
But keep up the good work!

294
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,674
So, tell me. How do you like my technique?

295
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,932
Here, try this on for size.

296
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,766
Okay. How about a little communication?

297
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,585
Talk to me. How else will I know what you like?

298
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:10,983
I'm... sensitive.

299
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,891
The body doesn't lie. There's no reason to hold back.

300
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:18,807
Just give yourself over to absolute pleasure!

301
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,974
I give myself, I do!

302
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:24,941
Come on now. Show me that smile.

303
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,141
Now it's my turn to show you what I've got.

304
00:15:31,185 --> 00:15:32,699
Stop! Don't do this! Please!

305
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,766
I'm drooling!
Seriously, I'm drooling all over the place!

306
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,426
I think I'm going to pee my pants!

307
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:49,382
You gonna tell me what's going on?

308
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,224
Look. I'm sorry. I really am.

309
00:15:54,307 --> 00:15:56,641
It's just you always seem so glum all the time.

310
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,693
I guess I'm worried life here
isn't really doing it for you.

311
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:02,572
I see.

312
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,573
So this whole thing was about getting me to smile?

313
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:06,849
Dumb. I know.

314
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,392
We didn't mean any harm by it, I swear. But...

315
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,182
We did get a little carried away, didn't we?

316
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:13,641
I can't smile.

317
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:14,328
Huh?

318
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,323
I try. But it doesn't work.

319
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:29,208
At first, they said my expression seemed
a little stiff and that I needed to relax.

320
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,390
But I really didn't think much of it.

321
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,409
I figured I was just tired.

322
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:40,512
But. Over time,
I completely lost the ability to smile.

323
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,684
Eventually, I couldn't summon
up other expressions either.

324
00:16:43,984 --> 00:16:47,378
The way things were, it didn't make
sense for me to stay where I was.

325
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:49,474
So I left, just like that monkey.

326
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:50,904
Yeah... But...

327
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,665
In the end, the monkey found a
safe place where he belonged.

328
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,258
So you can too...

329
00:16:55,836 --> 00:16:57,264
That's nice. Thanks.

330
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:01,459
But there's no point.

331
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:12,891
How can someone not be able to smile?

332
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:14,474
It just doesn't make any sense.

333
00:17:14,557 --> 00:17:16,109
I'm guessing it's psychological.

334
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,738
That's the only explanation I can come up with.

335
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,933
Maybe it was all too much for her.

336
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,782
Maybe she got burnt out living in the limelight

337
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:27,738
and always trying to meet other people's expectations.

338
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:29,281
She needs rest.

339
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:31,157
That'll make her go back to normal, won't it?

340
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:33,182
Well. One can always hope.

341
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,104
I want her to smile again.

342
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:38,212
Do you think it's selfish of me to want that for her?

343
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,916
If it is, maybe I don't care.

344
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,714
Kousaku. Kousaku!

345
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,399
Whoa! Who are you?

346
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,641
Do you not recognize me? Silly.

347
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,156
I am Gaia.

348
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,855
Gaia?

349
00:18:06,516 --> 00:18:09,803
Yes. I have come to deliver a message.

350
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,651
Uh... What message?

351
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,641
You must remember, Kousaku.

352
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:17,016
Remember what mankind has done to me.

353
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,974
Remember your ties to the soil.

354
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:23,363
Please. Whatever the future holds. Stand firm.

355
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,896
Gaia is always with you, my friend.

356
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:30,409
Till the end of time. Listen and you will hear me.

357
00:18:30,496 --> 00:18:32,391
Imploring you to honor the land!

358
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:33,682
No. Don't leave me here!

359
00:18:33,766 --> 00:18:35,599
Please! Gaia!

360
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:38,266
Gaia!

361
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:49,074
What was all that? Wacky.

362
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:55,485
"Remember what mankind has done to me."

363
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:15,516
Guys. I think I'm going to take Ringo to you-know-where.

364
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,831
I really want to show her that soil.

365
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,699
Good idea. After all, she does have
something in common with it right now.

366
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,007
Yeah. That's true.

367
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,453
Maybe seeing that field and hearing a positive
message would help her realize there is always hope.

368
00:19:33,614 --> 00:19:37,932
Schools like ours have things called
"Agricultural Clubs", or "Ag Clubs" for short!

369
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,991
Well, at any rate, we're headed to the site of a project

370
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:43,102
we inherited from some former students.

371
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:44,008
A project?

372
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:44,861
Yes.

373
00:19:44,928 --> 00:19:47,328
And if you're willing, we'd like for you to join in!

374
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:55,599
This is it?

375
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:56,222
Yep!

376
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,266
Not the tomato field over there?

377
00:19:58,557 --> 00:19:59,941
Nope. Here first.

378
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,719
Try touching the soil.

379
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,616
Right now?

380
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:06,146
Yeah.

381
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,641
It feels hard and dry.

382
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:18,199
Mm-hmm.

383
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,740
The reason it feels that way is 'cause the soil is dead.

384
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:20,973
It's dead?

385
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:22,994
It's a figure of speech.

386
00:20:23,238 --> 00:20:25,700
Crops won't grow here in its current condition.

387
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,488
That's so sad...

388
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,159
It's replant failure.

389
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:31,074
Remember, Miss Becky talked about it?

390
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,099
If you continue to grow the same plant in the same soil

391
00:20:35,182 --> 00:20:37,849
over and over, eventually, it won't grow anymore.

392
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,766
Yes. That's exactly right.

393
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,270
People try to get around this problem.

394
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:46,618
They use chemical fertilizers
to try to stimulate new growth.

395
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:50,355
But that only leads to disease and
winds up damaging the environment.

396
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:53,752
What you're seeing is the result of a vicious cycle.

397
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:02,307
Will the soil ever go back to
normal again or is it dead forever?

398
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,631
The process takes time.

399
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,495
This field started out with that very same soil.

400
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:13,865
It's been there since the very beginning.

401
00:21:14,932 --> 00:21:16,849
Previous Ag Clubbers started this project

402
00:21:16,932 --> 00:21:18,082
and we inherited it.

403
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:21,581
They worked for seven years. Day in and day out.

404
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:23,089
Now it's our turn.

405
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,411
Seven years?

406
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:26,879
It's not fixed.

407
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,525
There's still a lot to do to
get this soil back to normal.

408
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:32,641
But even though this soil has a long way to go,

409
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,349
this field is slowly improving,

410
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,092
doing her best to live on the land she's got.

411
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:44,075
So, eventually, this place will be reborn?

412
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,426
Hey, those tomatoes look good.

413
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:21,324
Can I eat one?

414
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:22,474
What? Now?

415
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:24,102
I'd like to.

416
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,420
Sure. Why not?

417
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,074
Here.

418
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:42,659
It's bitter.

419
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,783
Yeah, that's 'cause it's not ripe just yet.

420
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:46,682
Still, I'll eat it.

421
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:47,520
Huh?

422
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,298
Yep, definitely bitter.

423
00:22:52,563 --> 00:22:53,372
Told you.

424
00:22:53,877 --> 00:22:54,787
Yeah, but...

425
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:57,844
I like it.

426
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,029
Whoa. You... !

427
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:04,170
What?

428
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:06,263
Wait, this one's more ripe! Here.

429
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:07,980
It'll taste way better!

430
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:10,107
Mine is even riper than hers!

431
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:11,823
No, no, no, stick with mine.

432
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,065
It's definitely juicier than Kei's! Take it!

433
00:23:14,307 --> 00:23:15,354
Mine is fresher!

434
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:16,952
Food made with love,

435
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,939
love of the earth, love of people, spreads happiness.

436
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,032
The secret?

437
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,723
Reminding yourself that it's Nature's gift.

438
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,393
Working the land is one the
greatest joys life has to offer.

439
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,834
One day, I hope...

440
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,151
I hope you'll experience that joy firsthand.

441
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,936
Farming's Five Top Four!
