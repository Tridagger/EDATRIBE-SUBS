1
00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:02,488
The Takaido Fushinari cucumbers

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:03,610
are coming along nicely.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,707
The Wase Shinkuro eggplants
should be ready for harvest soon.

4
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:08,242
I give them a few more days.

5
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,673
Apart from the tomato splitting debacle.

6
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,700
It's been a very successful year.

7
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:22,017
Hello. Thank you for calling
Tamo-No-Rin, how can I help you?

8
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:25,321
Hello?

9
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:26,017
Kei?

10
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:29,990
It's you... How did you find me?!

11
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,300
You didn't really think you could escape, did you?

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,827
Come back right now.

13
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:35,040
I will not!

14
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:37,608
You and me, we're done, do I make myself clear?!

15
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:40,264
I'll be paying you a visit very soon.

16
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,347
If I were you, I'd get ready.

17
00:00:47,997 --> 00:00:50,964
One phone call... and it all comes flooding back.

18
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:53,922
My past rears its ugly head yet again.

19
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,384
Oh no! Everyone, I have terrible news!

20
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,945
With an entrance that dramatic,
this better be important.

21
00:02:35,575 --> 00:02:37,617
It's bad. I don't know how else to put it

22
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,204
other than to say the Principal broke.

23
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:41,632
Wait. He broke? Huh?!

24
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:50,675
Whoa. Is this the same mighty Principal I used to know?

25
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,939
The legendary warrior who killed
a bear with his own two hands?

26
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,094
What's that?

27
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:58,324
No, I'm afraid you won't be
able to speak to the bear today.

28
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,252
Okay.

29
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:03,472
It's clear he's completely lost his
mind, but why are we here?

30
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,255
Well, that's a great question. For the eggplants!

31
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:07,367
The eggplants?

32
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,492
Eggplants!

33
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,617
He keeps rambling on about
eggplants and I have no idea why.

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,563
Stop it!

35
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,190
It's not like we have a shortage of eggplants out there.

36
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,132
Why don't you just give him some already?

37
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:18,534
Yeah, that's the whole problem.

38
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,673
I've already given him eggplants,

39
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,128
but then he started saying,

40
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:22,788
"Hey. These are not real eggplants!"

41
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:25,617
Rrgh... Oooh, that burns me up!

42
00:03:25,808 --> 00:03:27,217
Do you mind if I take a look at them?

43
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,409
Maybe there's something wrong?

44
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:29,601
Knock yourself out.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,673
They seem perfectly edible, in my expert opinion.

46
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:33,766
Well, he disagrees.

47
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,400
And since these don't fit the bill,

48
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,659
I figured we could use our own eggplants instead,

49
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,601
which is why I brought you all here to save the day.

50
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:41,180
Ahhh...

51
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,518
I see. Yeah.

52
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,075
You're hoping for some sort of heartwarming

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,712
"after school special" plot, aren't you?

54
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:47,675
"The sad, forlorn principal snaps out of it

55
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,153
thanks to his devoted students."

56
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:50,224
Seen it before.

57
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,268
Geez, how unsentimental can you get?

58
00:03:52,492 --> 00:03:54,309
The principal's instincts are right.

59
00:03:54,721 --> 00:03:55,396
Huh?

60
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,495
Those eggplants. Not a single one of them is real.

61
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:01,150
They're manufactured.

62
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,200
Wait. What makes you say that?

63
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:05,338
Yes, what exactly are you blathering on about?

64
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,534
Sorry, but you're wrong, I've tried them myself.

65
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:10,209
They're thick, fresh, firm, and quite the mouthful.

66
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,335
See?

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,742
I can put the whole thing inside.

68
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,570
Listen to me.

69
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,591
If you let me use the home-ec room tomorrow.

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,030
I'll show you what a real eggplant looks like.

71
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:27,188
Oh, eggplant.

72
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,023
All right then, mister, you said you'd show us

73
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:30,909
the real deal, so bring it on!

74
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:33,325
I just hope your stuff has what it takes, Kei.

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,648
If it disappoints, then I'm stuck with

76
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,108
your itty-biddy eggplant either way, huh?

77
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:38,260
It's all yours.

78
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:40,492
Kei, no! Surely you don't mean that?

79
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,368
I appreciate your confidence, but let's not

80
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:43,318
get ahead of ourselves.

81
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,001
To begin, why don't we take a good, hard look

82
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,878
at the eggplants I've brought to the table?

83
00:04:47,398 --> 00:04:49,910
Top of the line and one hundred percent organic.

84
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,250
Farm to table. Five hundred a piece!

85
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,784
That's a lot?

86
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:56,534
You gotta be kidding me! That's, like, crazy expensive!

87
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:58,867
It's your move, Kamatori,

88
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,541
if you have one, that is.

89
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,521
I do. Check this out.

90
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,742
What is this, some kind of joke?!

91
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,534
Even supermarket eggplants look
better than that old, lumpy,

92
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,787
beat-up thing!

93
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:18,133
Before you knock it, give it a taste.

94
00:05:18,158 --> 00:05:20,341
Unless you're a "scaredy cat", of course.

95
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:22,450
It's... so... big.

96
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,222
Yeah, I'm shaking in my boots.

97
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:28,806
Sure does look good.

98
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:30,884
Yeah. Ms. Becky's eggplant

99
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,715
has started to let go of its moisture.

100
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:34,659
But Kei's hasn't changed at all.

101
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,372
And notice the size of those seeds.

102
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:38,550
Unlike yours truly, Kei's dish is disappointing

103
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:39,534
inside and out!

104
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,524
But you guys haven't tasted it yet.

105
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,522
All right then, here we go.

106
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,450
This is very delicious, Ms. Becky!

107
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,325
That just might be the best eggplant I've ever had!

108
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,367
Under-ripe. Just a little, though.

109
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,375
And the skin's too tough.

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,367
Obviously, you know nothing about eggplants,

111
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,867
that's how they're supposed to be!

112
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,040
All right then, time to give Kei's a try.

113
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:04,548
Eggplant!

114
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,523
Whoa. What the hell is he doing?!

115
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,219
Are you okay, sir?!

116
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:35,492
Now... That... Is... Tasty!

117
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:40,450
A delicious fruit packed

118
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,825
with a sense of immense accomplishment!

119
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,867
A scrumptious eggplant that will boldly go

120
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,742
where no eggplant has gone before!

121
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,367
Fresh and moist, though not watery.

122
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,534
A juicy morsel exploding with
flavor so smooth, so creamy,

123
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,450
you'll be on your knees begging for more!

124
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:57,450
A taste unlike any other taste
that has ever been before!

125
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,463
Sir, are you all right?

126
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,083
Yeah, that was insane.

127
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:07,003
Thank you very much.
That dish was truly a delectable triumph!

128
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:10,028
Mr. Kamatori. That, my dearest young man,

129
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,275
is an eggplant to rival all other eggplants!

130
00:07:12,603 --> 00:07:14,145
My friend, you have to tell me,

131
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,920
where in the world did you find such a thing?

132
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,909
Well, as a matter of fact,
I grew it myself in my spare time.

133
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:19,846
Amazing.

134
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,528
But I must know, how's it so much better than the rest?

135
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,183
The seeds are my secret weapons.

136
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,117
I wish someone would plant their secret weapon

137
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:27,395
in my eggplant field!

138
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,388
See, the thing is...

139
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,899
My seeds are purebred.

140
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,682
They might look a little bit plain.

141
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,242
But with a touch of love and the proper care,

142
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:36,750
they will always retain their time-honored taste.

143
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,039
The reason those other eggplants
didn't satisfy your craving is...

144
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:41,867
they're F1 hybrid fakes.

145
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,125
Wait a sec. What?

146
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:45,041
First filial generation.

147
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:48,306
It's no big deal,
just a genetics term we plant guys use.

148
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,416
Bred for appearance first and taste second,

149
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:52,992
these first generation cultivars were created

150
00:07:53,068 --> 00:07:55,038
for one reason alone: efficiency.

151
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,638
Efficiency?

152
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,768
This supreme focus on efficiency over quality

153
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:08,992
leads to the liberal use of chemical fertilizers

154
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:11,617
and pesticides on F1 products in an environment

155
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,710
that's as far from natural as you can get.

156
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,050
If that's not a bunch of manufactured crap,

157
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,273
then I don't know what is!

158
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:17,867
Hmm.

159
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:20,686
You do make an excellent point, Kamatori.

160
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:22,711
It's the truth, plain and simple, sir.

161
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,967
We have an elite educational summer program

162
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,870
that gives some of our more exemplary students

163
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,784
the unique opportunity to study
global agriculture abroad.

164
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:32,492
Miss Kochou Yoshida. Mister Kei Kamatori.

165
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:34,122
Would the two of you care to participate?

166
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,075
Well... Shall I do it?

167
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,316
Perhaps it might be worth a serious think.

168
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:42,311
Large-scale agriculture is flourishing overseas.

169
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,072
But, if Kei and I journey across the globe together,

170
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,242
people might mistakenly believe we're on our honeymoon.

171
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,534
Oh, what a delightful, and romantic,

172
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:49,633
comedy of errors that would be!

173
00:08:50,552 --> 00:08:53,436
Thank you, but I'm not interested
in overseas agriculture.

174
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:56,435
I'm here to study small-scale, pesticide free,

175
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,550
organic farming based on the "eat local" concept,

176
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:00,825
not to learn the ins and outs of mass corporatization.

177
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,337
Excuse me.

178
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:08,242
You! You're here!

179
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:11,424
So are you. Well, what fortuitous luck.

180
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,566
You've saved me the trouble of having to summon you.

181
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:15,992
I do hope you've made your preparations.

182
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,376
What's wrong?

183
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,159
You okay?

184
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,534
Hey, I know this guy!

185
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,992
You were on "Sunrise on Gaia", weren't you?

186
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:26,460
You're President Menjou of Hexa Techs!

187
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,362
Hexa... what?

188
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,399
Hexa Techs is a massive company

189
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,742
that does everything from growing crops

190
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:32,992
to shipping them overseas.

191
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:34,992
It's the most successful produce company there is

192
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,315
and he runs it all!

193
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,659
So, that means Kei Kamatori is...

194
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:42,213
My unworthy son.

195
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,128
No! You're not my father! You're not anything to me!

196
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:49,049
Hmph. So, you're his teacher I take it?

197
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,362
Yes, and available!

198
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:53,955
Please begin the process of
transferring my son out of here!

199
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,409
Like, very available!

200
00:09:55,492 --> 00:09:58,217
Gather up your things. You're not to waste time

201
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:01,123
wallowing in a place like this a moment longer.

202
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,226
How dare you?

203
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,191
What do you mean a "place like this"?

204
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:05,511
Ah. Ringo.

205
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:09,141
Answer me. What exactly does that mean?

206
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:12,950
This school is the best.

207
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,825
In all of...  I was going to say Japan,

208
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,259
but I really think this school grows

209
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,885
the most delicious vegetables in the whole world.

210
00:10:20,217 --> 00:10:23,217
"The most delicious vegetables in the whole world"?

211
00:10:24,969 --> 00:10:27,120
Um. What is so amusing?

212
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,914
Well, I'll give her this much:
for a lowly ag-school student,

213
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:31,784
she does have a strong imagination.

214
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:34,492
Like you're one to talk with
that F1 manufactured garbage

215
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,241
you call produce, you jerk!

216
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:38,734
You've got quite the lip on you,

217
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:41,211
but would you be willing to put
your money where your mouth is?

218
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,535
I'll gladly take you on any day, old man.

219
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:47,982
If that's the case, how about a showdown?

220
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,357
Bring it.

221
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:51,367
I propose a simple match:

222
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,059
your vegetables versus mine.

223
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,951
Whoever sells the most product wins.

224
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,233
I do have one stipulation. If I manage to beat you

225
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,812
fair and square, you'll stay out of agriculture forever.

226
00:11:00,837 --> 00:11:03,546
All right. But if you lose, you leave this school.

227
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,080
And never come back!

228
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,114
Good luck.

229
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:18,173
I haven't shown this to anyone yet.

230
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,026
But this is where I'm raising my purebred vegetables.

231
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:23,173
So, this is where you've been running off to

232
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:25,030
when you disappear for hours on end.

233
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,066
Geez, you're taking care of all of this by yourself?

234
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:30,403
Yeah. Bringing back heirloom vegetables

235
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,867
is a deep passion of mine.

236
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,071
Unlike my father...

237
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,559
The only thing he cares about is lining his pockets.

238
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:38,572
Quality doesn't matter to him at all!

239
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,806
Hey, Kei. I'm confused, if Menjou's your real last name,

240
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,626
then how come you go by Kamatori?

241
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,446
Kamatori is my aunt's name.

242
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,614
I asked her to adopt me, and she did.

243
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:48,885
You're adopted?

244
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,277
But why forsake your name?

245
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:53,230
'Cause my stupid father is a despicable human being!

246
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,035
At the end of the day, he's just a guy in a suit.

247
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,909
He has no real love for agriculture.

248
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:00,577
All he cares about is business.

249
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:02,742
So, is that the real reason why you didn't want to go

250
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,162
into that study abroad program, because of your father?

251
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:08,450
I love farming. And I'm here because it's important,

252
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,120
even if it is on a small scale.

253
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,669
I refuse to end up like him.

254
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:17,727
Back home, we tended a melon farm.

255
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,941
Without chemical fumigation,
melons are often prone to pests,

256
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,821
and let me tell you, our farm wasn't
without its share of issues on that front.

257
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:29,242
But the problem was, my mother was
very sensitive to these chemicals.

258
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,034
That didn't stop him from using them though,

259
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,409
his eye always fixated on the bottom line.

260
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,846
How awful.

261
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,700
Even after they killed his own wife,

262
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:38,250
he still uses those chemicals.

263
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:39,930
Because when all's said and done,

264
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,469
profit matters to him more than
anything else in this world.

265
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:44,122
Even his own family!

266
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,867
I'm sorry. But if that's not a prime example

267
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,009
of why all farms should operate chemical-free,

268
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,364
then I don't know what is.

269
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,719
Look, this is a lot to ask.

270
00:12:52,883 --> 00:12:55,258
And I know I shouldn't get
you involved in this showdown.

271
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:57,911
But the truth is, I really do need your help!

272
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,342
We're here for you, Kei. What do you say, you guys?

273
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,452
Sure! Done!

274
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,634
What I mean is, from a personal stand-point,

275
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:05,425
I have no reason to care whether Kei Kamatori

276
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,520
has to leave us behind.

277
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:09,249
But for the sake of Tamo-No Rin,
we cannot afford to lose him!

278
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,259
We'll show that old fart of a want to-be farmer

279
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:12,992
who really runs things around here!

280
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:14,577
What do you think about that, Ringo?

281
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:15,743
He's going down.

282
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,760
We'll wipe the floor with his dumb face!

283
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:19,600
Thanks, everyone.

284
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,867
Whoever sells the most product in one hour wins,

285
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:24,796
plain and simple.

286
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:28,555
Just to clarify, you mean sales, not profit, correct?

287
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:29,913
Yes, that's right.

288
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,209
But we have the same amount of market space.

289
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,117
You can try to boost sales by selling at a loss

290
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:35,111
but it won't work.

291
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,886
I know that, I'm not an imbecile.

292
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:39,201
If I were in your shoes, I'd worry about myself.

293
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,970
Right. First thing we need to do is set some prices.

294
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,842
Whatever his prices are, we'll match them.

295
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,488
Huh?

296
00:13:46,734 --> 00:13:49,700
My vegetables are organic and pesticide free.

297
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,093
Taste will win the day!

298
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,316
Well, look at what the cat dragged in.

299
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,257
Whoa. What the heck are you doing here?!

300
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:57,651
I came to help you.

301
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,588
Look: If you want to sell some vegetables

302
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:00,914
and be filthy stinking rich,

303
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:03,640
then all you have to do is use
Class D's Ace Sales Technique.

304
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,586
You'll leave ol' daddy dearest in the dust!

305
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,200
What's that sprayer for?

306
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,712
Watch and learn.

307
00:14:08,985 --> 00:14:11,262
Incredible! They look amazing!

308
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:14,306
Freshly picked, and covered top
to bottom in sweet morning dew!

309
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:16,992
Ladies and gentlemen.

310
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:18,364
Visit the parking lot now

311
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,037
for a limited-time-only fresh vegetable market!

312
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,745
All right! Let's get out there and sell, sell, sell!

313
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,742
Yeah!

314
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,367
It looks like it's pretty fresh.

315
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:28,325
But it does have a very unusual shape.

316
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,413
And worms have been at it.

317
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:31,175
Yes, and that's proof of its organic,

318
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,492
pesticide-free upbringing.

319
00:14:32,575 --> 00:14:34,200
If you don't believe me, have a taste!

320
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:36,825
Well. I suppose that's why the bugs like it.

321
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,740
I'm sold!

322
00:14:37,765 --> 00:14:39,868
Thanks a lot for shopping with us today!

323
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:41,409
Excellent. So far, there hasn't been

324
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:42,904
too much action at Hexa Techs.

325
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:45,950
Plus, I'm just getting started over here.

326
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:47,325
Time to seal the deal!

327
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:48,992
Yes, ma'am!

328
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:50,759
Hey! What the heck are they doing?!

329
00:14:50,784 --> 00:14:52,561
Relax, my friend, have a look.

330
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,947
What is this?

331
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:57,259
It's just a little trick I call, "merchandising."

332
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:58,868
"Merchan-dising"?

333
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,117
Listen up. It's midsummer, right?

334
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,513
And it's Friday, the start of a relaxing weekend.

335
00:15:03,742 --> 00:15:04,634
And you know what that means.

336
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,742
Actually, I don't.

337
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,634
It means lots of people with cash to spare

338
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,241
want to get out there and live it up a little.

339
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,700
And what's the easiest way to accomplish that feat?

340
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,435
Sleep?

341
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,409
Yakiniku, obviously!

342
00:15:14,434 --> 00:15:16,299
Korean barbeque!

343
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:19,662
Hey, look at that, they have yakiniku!

344
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,775
That's a great way to get our veggies in!

345
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:23,859
Merchandising is quite simple, really.

346
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:26,333
It's all about providing the right product.

347
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,892
In the perfect amount at the exact right price.

348
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,492
At precisely the right moment

349
00:15:30,575 --> 00:15:31,976
when people need what you're selling.

350
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:34,865
You guys, this is too much!
It's like she's so freaking smart

351
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,338
my head is gonna explode!

352
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,284
It looks like the only extras
they have are free samples.

353
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:43,159
I really think we can win! He's behind, isn't he?

354
00:15:43,184 --> 00:15:44,679
I mean, we've had a ton more customers.

355
00:15:44,704 --> 00:15:46,342
Still. We can do way better.

356
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,475
Whoa, you mean you've got something else up your sleeve?

357
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,200
Advertising, friends! Sales promotions!

358
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,617
It's like they always say:

359
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,342
"You can sell anything with sex."

360
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,784
Guys! It's boner jam time!

361
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:59,575
"We like veg-gies. They're racy. They're lacy.

362
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,570
They're tasty.

363
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,550
Don't you want to put them in your mouth?!"

364
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,242
Hey!

365
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:09,534
Oh, come on, Lady,

366
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:10,784
you can't stay embarrassed about this forever!

367
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,659
Right. Now let's get walking!

368
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,027
Is everybody eating their vegetables?

369
00:16:17,117 --> 00:16:18,040
Yeah!

370
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,617
Their voices, youth, charm,
and undeniable attractiveness

371
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,742
catch the customer's eye while
subconsciously making them

372
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:24,700
more eager to spend their money on your product.

373
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,703
Plus this.

374
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:29,492
In order to attract the ever-important male demographic,

375
00:16:29,575 --> 00:16:31,492
these pretty ladies come with Nestletix, too!

376
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,274
Hold on. What?

377
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,909
You can ask any girl you like

378
00:16:34,934 --> 00:16:37,117
to put any veggie you want between her breasts.

379
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,492
Whoa! Amazing. That's an incredible strategy!

380
00:16:39,517 --> 00:16:41,575
To compete with Hexa Techs' sheer brand power,

381
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,075
"the gloves" are gonna have to come off,

382
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,159
or in the case of these ladies, "the bras."

383
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:47,367
You're so smart... So, uh...

384
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,265
Any girl?

385
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,651
Uh. Like this?

386
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh yeah! We hit the jackpot!

387
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:01,950
Now it's our turn to have some fun!

388
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,450
Holy crap, what the heck are you doing?

389
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:04,575
Why are you here?!

390
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,233
We came to show that snake in a suit

391
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,034
what a proper peasant uprising is like!

392
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,905
Plus, I hear his dad's a total silver fox.

393
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,803
All four of them representing in full force!

394
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:16,910
I'll help.

395
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,700
Anything for one of the most
talented students in school.

396
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:21,742
But sweet Kei, call me "Mom."

397
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:22,433
Please!

398
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,005
Go on, give it a try!

399
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,217
Come on, big boy, there's nothing to be nervous about!

400
00:17:26,242 --> 00:17:28,464
That's right, sugar tits, call me your naughty mama!

401
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:30,886
Who's your naughty mama, huh?! Who's your hot mama?!

402
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,634
Come on, give mommy a big,
wet smooch right on the old kisser,

403
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:34,500
preferably with tongue!

404
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:35,049
Let's get her!

405
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:35,891
I'm on it!

406
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:38,251
Stop squirming!

407
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:38,808
Let me go!

408
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:41,159
Damn you! Stop it!

409
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:42,757
Let me out! Let! Me! Out!

410
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:46,468
Come and eat our veggies!

411
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,035
Just look at this delightfully scrumptious eggplant

412
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,259
nestling between her two gigantic fun bags!

413
00:17:51,284 --> 00:17:53,214
Ugh. Marketing is so beneath me.

414
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,467
Whatever, it works like a charm every time.

415
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,467
Hang in there, Boobs, you'll make it through this.

416
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,182
"Boobs"?! Don't call me that!

417
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,092
Check us out, ladies!

418
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:01,657
Huh?

419
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,075
So. Want to take a bite of my eggplant?

420
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,137
Or would you like to munch on my big cuke?

421
00:18:09,174 --> 00:18:10,716
Or, my tomatoes?!

422
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,117
Someone let me outta here right now!

423
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,972
I have crops to harvest!

424
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,409
All that work, and in the end,

425
00:18:35,434 --> 00:18:37,200
we still couldn't even come close to competing

426
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,492
with the Hexa Techs brand.

427
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,825
So is that the reason you beat us,

428
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:42,012
'cause people have heard of Hexa Techs before?!

429
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:42,797
That's not it.

430
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:43,677
What?!

431
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:47,784
Give it a try.

432
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:49,675
You too.

433
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,867
It tastes good.

434
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,906
It does. Really good.

435
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,752
What?! But how?! How can that be?!

436
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,342
You've poo-poo'd our vegetables from the very beginning,

437
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,992
and even agreed on a head-to-head showdown

438
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,283
without so much as even tasting what we have to offer.

439
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,405
Do you know what that makes you, Kei?

440
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,617
A naïve little brat!

441
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,459
Answer me this:

442
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:29,016
how many hours do you devote
to your vegetables every day?

443
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:33,257
One hour? Two? Five, perhaps six at most?

444
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,716
We at Hexa Techs attend to our vegetables

445
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,846
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

446
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:39,978
You students, with your little farming hobby,

447
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,217
could never compete with the superiority of our product!

448
00:19:42,242 --> 00:19:43,925
Fine. Spin it however you want,

449
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,034
but all you're really doing is manipulating F1s

450
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:46,775
and you know it!

451
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,909
Hexa Techs embraces technology, is that so abominable?

452
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,134
Do you really believe that vegetables

453
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:55,159
raised by nature alone are somehow nobler

454
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,034
than those that have been researched and improved

455
00:19:57,117 --> 00:20:01,610
by scientific methods? Tell me: do you intend
to rewrite the very history of agriculture?

456
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,963
No, I just...

457
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,585
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

458
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:07,700
It's vulgar. Everything you do is for money, that's all.

459
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,197
The truth is, I've absolutely no respect for you!

460
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:12,784
Our product is safer. Far less expensive!

461
00:20:12,858 --> 00:20:14,504
And above all else, tastes better!

462
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,888
So tell me:

463
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,787
Where's the vulgarity in what I do? Eh?!

464
00:20:18,825 --> 00:20:20,145
It's called progress!

465
00:20:21,306 --> 00:20:26,065
You fool! That remark of yours
belittles not only agricultural workers,

466
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,652
but it's also an
insult to the consumer!

467
00:20:29,617 --> 00:20:31,385
No. That's not true.

468
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:34,267
Everything I fight for is for the good of the consumer.

469
00:20:34,795 --> 00:20:36,258
You-You're dead wrong.

470
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,128
I keep my vegetables organic
and pesticide-free for them!

471
00:20:41,632 --> 00:20:43,318
You still don't get it, do you?

472
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,168
You're just imposing your own shallow,

473
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,530
unilateral idealism onto them.

474
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:50,418
Can you grow delicious vegetables

475
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,215
without chemicals and pesticides?

476
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:55,243
To grow truly tasty, delectable vegetables,

477
00:20:55,268 --> 00:20:56,934
you need high-level farming techniques

478
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,668
and the commensurate experience.

479
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,634
And last I checked, you had neither.

480
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,463
But at Hexa Techs we have plenty.

481
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,091
So brand recognition isn't the only reason you lost.

482
00:21:06,835 --> 00:21:09,390
I've failed. It's over!

483
00:21:09,744 --> 00:21:12,836
I'm a man of my word... So take me where you will!

484
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:22,676
No. Actually, I've changed my mind.

485
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,382
You what?!

486
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:25,992
I can't let my company fail in the hands

487
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,289
of a successor that cares only to grow paltry crops.

488
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,585
You are free to do as you wish.

489
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,904
I don't understand!

490
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,668
You want to win? Then find a realistic method

491
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:37,984
to grow better vegetables than your old man.

492
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:54,259
I hope the study abroad program

493
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,350
gives you what you need!

494
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:58,653
If I don't get to know my enemy,
how can I ever hope to defeat him?

495
00:21:58,678 --> 00:22:01,483
And besides, I really should see
what this world has to offer.

496
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:03,950
I'm a little worried that you-know-who

497
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:04,805
hasn't shown up yet.

498
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,407
Yeah, where is Boobs?

499
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,037
Have no fear, Kochou's here!

500
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:12,649
Oh, wow.

501
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:13,925
The little princess looks like a bride

502
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,700
about to leave for her honeymoon.

503
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:17,401
No, no, no, no, no, you're wrong!

504
00:22:17,427 --> 00:22:18,902
I resent the implication!

505
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,884
What you see here is nothing more than proper etiquette!

506
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:23,009
You country bumpkins know nothing of the chic world

507
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,544
of international travel.

508
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:27,325
Umm. Come along, Kei Kamatori.

509
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,140
Right.

510
00:22:28,658 --> 00:22:30,325
Well, I guess it's time to go.

511
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,659
Yep. You guys be careful.

512
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,550
Woo! Bring me something awesome!

513
00:22:33,575 --> 00:22:34,950
See you later, guys.

514
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:38,787
Cheerful Farming Village.
