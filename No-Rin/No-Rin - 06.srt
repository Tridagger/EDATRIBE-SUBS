1
00:00:01,073 --> 00:00:02,240
Moe Eggs!

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:05,850
Farm fresh, unfertilized and unbelievably smooth!

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,526
Cooked or raw.

4
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:09,985
Yum! So very tasty!

5
00:00:11,091 --> 00:00:12,893
Where else can you get eggs likes this

6
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,915
but--you guessed it--Tamo No-Rin High School?

7
00:00:16,234 --> 00:00:18,901
Our eggs use condoms, so you know they're safe!

8
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,650
Sure, that last part was bit much,

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,564
but, hey, we had an idea and we ran with it.

10
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:27,260
None of us knew it would be the proverbial golden goose.

11
00:01:58,442 --> 00:01:59,779
Moe rice.

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,740
Any clue what I'm talking about?

13
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:02,978
Yeah, no.

14
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,532
Oh-ho! You've got to see it!
They've been all over the news!

15
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:08,015
Very simple concept.

16
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:11,064
Rice with a hot naked lady on
the packaging sells like wow!

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,740
Step one: Produce. Step two: Sex.

18
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,057
Step three: Cash.

19
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:16,750
It's actually real.

20
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,073
Wow. Really?

21
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,638
They hired a manga artist.

22
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,661
I forget his name,
but he's real popular with the otaku crowd.

23
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:26,278
He drew a bishojo chick in a tantalizing pose and boom.

24
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:29,400
Thirty-two tons of rice sold online in ninety days.

25
00:02:29,546 --> 00:02:32,090
The company normally unloads about fifteen tons a year,

26
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:33,740
so the new mascot earned them eight times

27
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:34,932
their average monthly sales.

28
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:36,465
Whoa! Damn!

29
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,048
Imagine how much we can sell

30
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:39,419
if we took the same approach?!

31
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:42,003
A little tasteful nudity and the
school would be rolling in it!

32
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,657
I smell profit. Ah, hello my lovelies.

33
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,621
Heads up! We've got a Top Four!

34
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:49,458
Whenever two or more people talk finance,

35
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:52,562
this one's ready to pounce! Hide your 401k's!

36
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:56,194
Hmm... So, she's a Top Four?

37
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,282
Correct! The school has four of these types in all.

38
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:01,650
One: Fun Bags Yoshida from Class A.

39
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,365
Two: Bio Suzuki from Class B.

40
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,922
Three: Woodman Rintarou from Class F.

41
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,852
Rose Hanazono from Class E.

42
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:12,782
And last but not least, from Class D,

43
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:16,124
agronomic specialist and marketing-slash-logistics guru,

44
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,740
Money Kanegami!

45
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,298
Hmm... You just named five.

46
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,829
Never mind about that!

47
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,454
So... Rolling in it, huh?

48
00:03:24,712 --> 00:03:26,282
Something we can help you with?

49
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,722
All we've been through together
and that's how you say hello?

50
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,705
Thought I counted for more than that.

51
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:33,757
Didn't your recent hedge fund shenanigans

52
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,300
get you indefinitely suspended?

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,593
Oh, they let me back in as of yesterday.

54
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,865
But let's cut to the chase. You're cooking something up.

55
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,301
Mama wants in.

56
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:42,591
Good for you.

57
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:44,608
The Moe racket's a cash cow.

58
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:47,314
I've been wanting to dip my wick
into that honey pot for ages.

59
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,007
Yeah, well, easier said than done.

60
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,657
it's not exactly low-hanging fruit.

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,990
He's right, you know.

62
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,698
We'd need a big name artist onboard.

63
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,838
Anybody can slap a pic of some spread-eagle bimbo

64
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:58,573
on the front of a rice bag and use it to boost sales.

65
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:01,967
You want a big-name artiste, then here you go.

66
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:06,197
It doesn't get much bigger than the
illustrator for Kippu, ladies ann germs.

67
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,665
He's available, he's interested,
and he's in my contacts.

68
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,443
What?!

69
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:12,793
When you say Kippu, you mean THE Kippu?!

70
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:14,323
None other.

71
00:04:14,628 --> 00:04:17,563
You mean that one guy who does all
those light novel illustrations?!

72
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:19,345
That's him.

73
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:21,340
The genius who draws all the critically acclaimed

74
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:22,444
pinup girl artwork?!

75
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:24,382
Indeed.

76
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,340
The same dude who fell from grace with the art community

77
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,423
not long ago for manga-fying some lameass story about

78
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,157
Ag students and whose family threatened to cut him off

79
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,823
if he didn't rethink his career choices?!

80
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,573
Yes, I think we all know it is.

81
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,175
And he's sincerely interested?

82
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,887
Well he is a professional.

83
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,782
If the price is right,
I think we should consider him sincere.

84
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,784
He's worth every penny, I can assure you.

85
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,532
Wow. You hear that?

86
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:48,782
That's the sound of us actually having a shot at this!

87
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,708
Lend me a hand, my lovelies,

88
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:54,073
and I just might be able to make it worth your while.

89
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,166
Huh. Lend you a hand? What do you want us to do?

90
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:57,809
Look at me.

91
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,130
I'm not exactly in the yearbook
as "most trustworthy," now am I?

92
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,323
But if I had fine, upstanding students

93
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:05,948
like yourselves to vouch for me...

94
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,681
We could get this thing off the ground.

95
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,573
Ahh... So we're your bargaining chip.

96
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:12,422
I completely understand!

97
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,907
Kousaku would be more than happy to help!

98
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,232
Don't volunteer me!

99
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,153
Look, this is simple risk management.

100
00:05:17,309 --> 00:05:19,474
If Kanegami runs afoul of anti-trust laws

101
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,782
and the school needs a scapegoat,

102
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,279
somebody needs to stay behind with the shredder.

103
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,632
Why does it get to be you?

104
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,450
Basic question: What are we planning to sell?

105
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:29,115
I'd say damn near anything given this guy's talent.

106
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,590
A drawing of his could sell ice to Eskimos.

107
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,414
Now, we got to balance supply and demand,

108
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:34,948
so think stable inventory.

109
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:36,782
Best branding in the world isn't going to do us

110
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,198
a whole lot of good if there's
nothing to package, right?

111
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,177
Gotcha.

112
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:42,919
The trick is to sell something
we have constant access to.

113
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,747
Something with a yield we can rely on.

114
00:05:44,985 --> 00:05:45,782
I've got just the thing.

115
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:46,769
Excellent choice.

116
00:05:47,115 --> 00:05:48,073
Oh yeah, those!

117
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:49,186
We have a winner.

118
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,252
Um, okay?

119
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,990
Out of the question!

120
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,669
C'mon, don't be like that!

121
00:05:55,697 --> 00:05:56,704
They're perfect!

122
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,382
Your eggs are made for the big time and you know it!

123
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,411
Ugh! Disgusting! Moe eggs! Please!

124
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:04,241
The very idea induces apoplexy!

125
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,149
Producers with integrity compete
on the merit of their product.

126
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:07,862
Period.

127
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,228
Is it lonely up there on your high horse?

128
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:13,448
This is no different in principle than selling them

129
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,374
at the Green Shop.

130
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,864
Look, they're still being touted on their merits.

131
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,801
We're just helping those merits
reach a larger market share.

132
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,414
Ah! So it's you! Why am I not surprised?

133
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:25,382
Do we or don't we owe it to ourselves and the school

134
00:06:25,407 --> 00:06:27,472
to cast our net as widely as possible?

135
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,278
And I suppose next you'll lecture me on

136
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:30,615
laissez faire capitalism!

137
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:32,986
Don't think I don't know what you're up to, madam!

138
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:36,073
D'aw. Please. Why be so reactive, doll?

139
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,222
Take a moment to give me a fair hearing.

140
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,823
Whatever I'm "up to" here, the end game is this:

141
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:42,769
your eggs becoming a household name.

142
00:06:43,943 --> 00:06:44,723
Well...

143
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,869
I have to admit, they are certainly worthy.

144
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,269
Just imagine...

145
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:50,979
Think about it.

146
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,702
A carton in every kitchen in Japan.

147
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,161
You know, I can't think of another farmer

148
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:57,276
for whom that's true.

149
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,323
But we've always prided ourselves

150
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:01,116
on the "locally produced" label.

151
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,571
Won't our regular clientele feel betray--

152
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:05,236
Sweetheart, listen.

153
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:07,436
You've heard the horror stories.

154
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:10,379
Feed laced with hormones and antibiotics.

155
00:07:10,818 --> 00:07:12,972
Unsanitary living conditions.

156
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,960
Now, haven't the corporate farms had their shot?

157
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,906
Hasn't the public been subjected
to their "anything to fatten

158
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,134
the bottom-line" ideology long enough?

159
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,738
C'mon, take your place in the sun.

160
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,185
This isn't about money!

161
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,346
Oh, no. It's about consumer rights!

162
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,797
Please! Do the right thing!

163
00:07:35,549 --> 00:07:37,816
Y-Yes. The system can work.

164
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:40,549
We can make it work. I believe in us!

165
00:07:41,073 --> 00:07:43,657
--I... --Game, set, match.

166
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,467
Damn she's good.

167
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,701
Okey-doke! The product is Moe Eggs.

168
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:55,089
The mascot is Aleggsis. We brand aggressively.

169
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,590
Come on! Let me hear you!

170
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:57,903
Woo-hoo!

171
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:00,525
So... How we doing?

172
00:08:00,657 --> 00:08:03,282
Not so bad. People seem to like the blog.

173
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,846
Great! Post the four-panel manga!

174
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,548
How's the print media campaign?

175
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:10,223
Just bought space in three issues of a top anime mag!

176
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:13,346
Hello. Moe Eggs.

177
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:15,991
Yes. Yes.

178
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,166
Just one moment.

179
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,134
Someone wants the figurine copyright!

180
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:21,967
Huh? Okay. That was fast.

181
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,315
Heh. They're falling over themselves.

182
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,443
Hmm... Now what?

183
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,191
They want to use it for an event?

184
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:31,040
I say let them have the copyright.

185
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:33,345
We're an LLC, so the risk is on them.

186
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,007
Either way, it's free exposure.

187
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,115
That's the ticket!

188
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,351
Kei! Give them the go!

189
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,198
Roger.

190
00:08:38,745 --> 00:08:40,240
Moe Eggs!

191
00:08:40,826 --> 00:08:43,241
They like it when you peel them a little rough.

192
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,490
So wet and slippery...

193
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,740
Go on... No one's looking.

194
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,230
You deserve the very best!

195
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,615
Thank you for calling Moe Eggs.

196
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:57,714
No, sorry.

197
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,387
We're not accepting any more preorders at this time.

198
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:03,198
Yeah, that's right: as advertised.

199
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,943
Order now and your shipment will get there in 90 days.

200
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:08,823
Okay. This is getting out of hand.

201
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,220
Bad news.

202
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:13,153
The school server's down. Too many orders!

203
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,282
Aw, man. This is the last thing we need!

204
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,673
Oh, no. They'll start burning up the phones.

205
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,090
Alright, that settles it.

206
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:20,423
We need a phone bank in here, STAT.

207
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,615
First things first.

208
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,382
We've got to get these packed up and shipped!

209
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,757
Right, right. Man, we need more hands.

210
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,577
Got anybody we can bring in on this?

211
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,309
Sell my little porcelain orbs, sell!

212
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,532
Look, I'm telling you: twins are the way to go.

213
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,152
Perfect choice for branding double-yolk eggs.

214
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,587
I say yes.

215
00:09:45,246 --> 00:09:46,976
I'm leaning toward "Hard-Boiled Shelly"

216
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,235
and "Ramona Ramekin."

217
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:53,323
Ooh, I like that! Plays up their versatility!

218
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,740
Bad news. I think We have a graphics issue.

219
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,199
What in the name of...?

220
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,959
What is that?!

221
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:02,548
Gross! She's old enough to be my mom!

222
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,979
I thought we were all in agreement to go Lolita.

223
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:07,831
I, uh, think there's been a misunderstanding.

224
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,657
This is not good, people!

225
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:13,576
Older women have their charms.

226
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:14,865
Th-They do?

227
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,293
Call her experienced.

228
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:19,684
She's a shoe-in for the soft-boiled line.

229
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,243
Ooh!

230
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:22,687
Make it happen!

231
00:10:22,797 --> 00:10:23,494
Aye-aye, sir!

232
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,990
Throw up a teaser on the website!

233
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,154
All over it!

234
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:32,599
I want out.

235
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:36,385
Eh? Why? We're kicking ass!

236
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:41,168
I'll be honest with you: I
don't like where we're headed.

237
00:10:41,994 --> 00:10:43,012
Just look at us.

238
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:46,051
Don't you resent having to fall
back on cheap marketing tricks?

239
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:50,198
It's about exposure, man.

240
00:10:50,236 --> 00:10:52,652
How else are our eggs going
to compete in a global market?

241
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,997
Or don't you believe in our product?

242
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,328
As usual, you've put the cart before the horse.

243
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,632
Oh, I'm putting the cart before the horse?

244
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:03,294
How about you think outside the box?!

245
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:05,334
Hah. Whatever, man.

246
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,740
Have fun playing corporate tycoon.

247
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,221
Giddyup, Jun.

248
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:14,857
Heeyah!

249
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,384
Kei, wait!

250
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:20,328
Ugh. He's going to break that poor thing's back.

251
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,299
You've heard the hype,

252
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,215
you probably have a carton of
her eggs in your refrigerator.

253
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,735
Now hear first-hand from the chicken lady herself

254
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,444
whose business went from modest to Moe

255
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,823
in a mindboggling matter of weeks,

256
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:37,348
whether or not there's a correlation between

257
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,930
egg consumption and cup size.

258
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,492
Well organically produced eggs
are a good source of protein,

259
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,978
so it's reasonable to posit a relationship-- Ugh!

260
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:46,233
I did not agree to debase myself!

261
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,144
She sure has become a celebrity.

262
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,340
Yeah, the camera adores her.

263
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:53,964
Did you ever think the company would take off like this?

264
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,712
I don't know. Maybe.

265
00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:58,051
I mean, I figured we'd do well-- Whoops.

266
00:11:58,076 --> 00:12:00,407
There. Don't want the meat to catch fire.

267
00:12:00,432 --> 00:12:03,335
You want intestines a little crispy, but not well done.

268
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,573
When the fat's crackling,

269
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,382
that's the sign to move it off the heat.

270
00:12:06,407 --> 00:12:07,032
Voila.

271
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,666
That's a new one to me.

272
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,548
Oh, nice! Absolutely perfect!

273
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:15,448
It's a good metaphor for business.

274
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:17,411
When it's cooked to perfection, you're done.

275
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:19,407
You've got to know when to move on.

276
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,343
It's the difference between a gourmand and a pyromaniac.

277
00:12:22,735 --> 00:12:23,676
Huh.

278
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,356
So what's next on the board for Moe Eggs?

279
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,290
That's the point I'm trying to make.

280
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:33,783
Moe Eggs is a thing of the past.

281
00:12:34,315 --> 00:12:35,740
What? But, we...

282
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:37,532
Local farmers will buy the trademark.

283
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,890
The school will make a killing.

284
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:42,153
And we move on to other things. All for the best really.

285
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,876
Our business venture has been a shot in the arm

286
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,032
for the local economy.

287
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,382
We're selling out?

288
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,757
Well, sort of. But we won't reap a profit.

289
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:50,966
Students aren't legally allowed to exploit the school

290
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:53,036
for personal gain. You do know that, right?

291
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:53,704
Hang on--!

292
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,323
Easy now, Rockefeller.

293
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:58,296
Ag training's not about making
returns on the produce we grow.

294
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,546
It's about learning how to make returns.

295
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,281
Think of it like a financial laboratory.

296
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,114
Now's the time for experimentation,

297
00:13:06,157 --> 00:13:07,483
not portfolio building.

298
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,991
Which is great, 'cause once we're out in the real world,

299
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:12,157
we won't have the safety nets we have here.

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,615
We mess up, we make bad business choices...

301
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:15,636
We're on our own.

302
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,698
See, kid. There'll be plenty of time to amass

303
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,448
our fortunes once we've graduated.

304
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:24,657
For the moment, the trick is to
take advantage of our freedom.

305
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,211
A gourmand enjoys a dish cooked to perfection.

306
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:32,249
A pyro just ends up getting burned.

307
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,700
Kanegami.

308
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,036
Yeah?

309
00:13:38,242 --> 00:13:40,251
Well. I don't really know how to put this.

310
00:13:40,284 --> 00:13:43,054
I guess I always thought your whole MO was making money.

311
00:13:43,086 --> 00:13:44,715
Don't get me wrong.

312
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,000
Money's all that and a bag of chips, no lie.

313
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,557
But it's far from the be-all-end-all, trust me.

314
00:13:50,026 --> 00:13:53,568
Thing is, when push comes to shove, I crave adventure.

315
00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:56,132
Passion. Sure, money can make that happen,

316
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:57,474
but it's not the end goal.

317
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,861
It's a tool. That's all.

318
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:01,894
Wow, that's deep.

319
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,358
Right. So. Eggs are old news.

320
00:14:07,698 --> 00:14:09,853
But, there are plenty of other markets to tap.

321
00:14:10,072 --> 00:14:11,254
Such as?

322
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:15,507
Heh... Clearly the next logical step is yaoi.

323
00:14:15,532 --> 00:14:17,920
The B in Class B stands for Boy Love!

324
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,772
Nice of you to finally put
in an appearance, Akari.

325
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:26,073
Garcon! Warm glass of milk, please! No ice cubes!

326
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,703
What's going on?

327
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:31,244
The otaku market is setting its
sights on the female dollar.

328
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:34,834
Women are dropping more cash on sex
merch than their male counterparts.

329
00:14:35,154 --> 00:14:37,407
Maybe the modern woman has become lonesome.

330
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,824
Whatever the case, only a fool would ignore the trend.

331
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,188
Yeah, I get it. But, what's our product?

332
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,887
Try to stay with me, chief:

333
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:46,323
you know the fungal culture practicum from Class F?

334
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:50,246
You mean those grubby old logs they
use to cultivate shiitake and shimeji

335
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:51,645
and other crap like that?

336
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:55,026
Think about it, kiddo. You're a fungi, am I right?

337
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:57,198
What does that even mean?

338
00:14:57,282 --> 00:15:00,329
Look, I got to be honest. Mushrooms sorta gross me out.

339
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:03,344
Oh calm down, reverend. It's not the 'shrooms I'm after,

340
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,086
it's the logs those little fellas are cultivated on.

341
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,369
The market's screaming for one.

342
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,457
Wait. Really?

343
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:12,566
The branding creates itself.

344
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:15,891
The hell are you?! Crazy?!

345
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,119
Try to be objective for a moment, please.

346
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:21,340
The demand-side definitely has an upper limit.

347
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:24,379
It'll be a cash-grab pure and simple, you dig?

348
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,007
We'll adopt a hit-and-run strategy

349
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,740
that'll maximize our market impact.

350
00:15:27,823 --> 00:15:30,698
I, uh... think you might be taking things too...

351
00:15:30,782 --> 00:15:33,110
Hey, Suzuki, I could use a little help any time now.

352
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:34,948
You know what'd be perfect?

353
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:36,490
A little dab of yogurt on the tip.

354
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:38,542
I am not comfortable with this!

355
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:39,759
Cross promotion!

356
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,365
We could say "apply Class B yogurt

357
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:44,645
for mushrooms bigger than your wildest dreams!"

358
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,537
You know what?

359
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:50,910
That's just insane enough to work.

360
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,608
This is gonna be huge.

361
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,785
I ought to put an axe through your skull!

362
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,336
Yeah, I know, right?

363
00:15:58,562 --> 00:16:00,582
What do you say we go to the roof.

364
00:16:00,691 --> 00:16:01,802
Just you and me.

365
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,506
'Cause I really feel like teaching somebody how to fly.

366
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:07,065
Maybe some other time, that's not why I'm here.

367
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,672
I thought you'd be interested in
showing off Class F's mad skills.

368
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:13,338
Very funny. Good one, man.

369
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:16,443
You think we train as hard as
we do to help make pornography?

370
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,635
Believe me, I'm as uncomfortable as you.

371
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,876
No worries, dude. I get it. It's too weird.

372
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,419
I should've seen this coming.

373
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:26,423
But could you at least have a look at it

374
00:16:26,448 --> 00:16:27,757
and tell me whether or not it's possible?

375
00:16:27,802 --> 00:16:30,342
Fine. Technically it couldn't be easier.

376
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:33,240
You drill yourself a big enough
hole, stick in the spores,

377
00:16:33,323 --> 00:16:35,014
and then there's fungus among us.

378
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,198
And if the log was carved into a crotch-shape,

379
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:38,198
it would still work?

380
00:16:38,282 --> 00:16:40,053
Not on your life!

381
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:41,766
Okay, got it.

382
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:45,157
That's a damn shame.

383
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,709
And here I thought we had the perfect storm of skill

384
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,215
and target audience to flood the Forestry department

385
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,228
with easy women.

386
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:52,543
Huh?

387
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,675
Oh, yeah. Of course.

388
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,257
If ever there was a product designed for fujoshi girls,

389
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,251
this would've been it. That lot loves their fantasy.

390
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,700
Fujoshi.

391
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:04,221
Genuine fujoshi.

392
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,041
Yeah!

393
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,882
Think of all the lonely ladies out there

394
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,990
who dream of you manly forestry types!

395
00:17:10,026 --> 00:17:12,110
What you do is pure sex to them:

396
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,641
you hunks are like the Texas Rangers or something!

397
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:15,618
Right, Kousaku?

398
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,757
Huh? Oh, yeah! Absolutely!

399
00:17:18,782 --> 00:17:20,634
Like I said, it's a damn shame.

400
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,757
Had we been able to make this work, there's no telling

401
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,157
how many free-wheeling gals

402
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,294
would've been falling over themselves to join Class F.

403
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:30,090
All those hotties desperate for
attention from big, strong men.

404
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,157
You know, maybe I was jumping the gun.

405
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,255
I should hear you out.

406
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,175
So here's the name.

407
00:17:40,597 --> 00:17:44,090
Ugh. Brace for it, we're going with "Yeah.
Pick That Mushroom.

408
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,214
There You Go."

409
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,882
You're looking at hundreds of
years of mushroom cultivation

410
00:17:47,907 --> 00:17:48,911
at its finest.

411
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:51,010
I give you the standard shiitake mushroom

412
00:17:51,162 --> 00:17:52,798
with its dark, meaty cap!

413
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,257
The shimeji, with its cluster
of fleshy forking tendrils.

414
00:17:56,282 --> 00:17:57,614
Hungry, anybody?

415
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,183
Eight inches of thick, magisterial heft.

416
00:18:00,323 --> 00:18:01,823
The king trumpet!

417
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:05,123
The maitake, whose dark frills
give off an intoxicating scent.

418
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,656
Smell that musk!

419
00:18:06,907 --> 00:18:10,202
The nameko, with it viscous
coat and suggestive skin-tone.

420
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,361
Careful ladies!

421
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:14,532
The lovely mukitake. Like a gymnast's six pack.

422
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,657
And the oyster, fungal art splayed like a mosaic.

423
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,990
This is the stuff!

424
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:21,490
Call now and we'll include with your order

425
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:23,894
the visually alluring fertilizer mix.

426
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:26,707
Our very special ANaL BB Yogurt Blend!

427
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:29,198
Now, for obvious reasons, we can't sell this stuff

428
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,448
through the usual networks. Not to worry, though:

429
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:34,552
we'll be moving units through
Bio's very own fujoshi pipeline!

430
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,616
Packaging will be plain.
The label will say "Folk Crafts."

431
00:18:39,482 --> 00:18:39,948
Right.

432
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:42,414
Needless to say,
if anyone catches us selling these things,

433
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,941
we're toast. So let's keep everything on the DL.

434
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,032
We took advantage of our freedom, all right.

435
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:52,481
The world didn't know what hit it when we were done.

436
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,362
And we were done pretty quick.

437
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:57,384
Just as we were starting out.

438
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,150
We got busted.

439
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,323
Oh boy. Suspension.

440
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,323
My, Miss Kinoshita,

441
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:15,990
that yukata looks fabulous on you!

442
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:16,865
Think so?

443
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,683
Why yes!

444
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,782
They were made for flat-chested girls!

445
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:27,570
Just think. Caught 'cause one of the top
clients was a classmate's grandmother.

446
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:31,058
Yeah, well. Guess we had it coming.

447
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,615
Hey, look on the bright side.
It's like three days' vacation.

448
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,069
You got off a lot easier than your ring leader.

449
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,100
She had it much worse, appropriately.

450
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,986
Repeat offenders like her get three weeks' suspension.

451
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,256
And all of Class F got a formal
reprimand which, believe me,

452
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,395
you wouldn't have wanted.

453
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,879
So... what happened to them?

454
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:51,198
The forestry teacher, Mr. Tachikawa, beat their ass.

455
00:19:51,385 --> 00:19:52,169
Yeesh.

456
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:54,298
Their summer break's going to suck, too.

457
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,379
They'll spend most of it on Mount Onake.

458
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:59,754
Oh snap. Mount Onake. No thanks.

459
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,032
I'm with you on that.

460
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:01,815
Hm?

461
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,779
Oh. Hey.

462
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:06,173
Got a new business idea brewing.

463
00:20:06,198 --> 00:20:07,371
For when I get back.

464
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:09,746
What do you say? You interested?

465
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:10,364
Huh?

466
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,377
I've got everything lined up.

467
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:15,678
I just need your... front-man skills.

468
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:24,047
Didn't think so. Oh well.

469
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:31,941
One more thing.

470
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,414
Tell me. Did you have fun?

471
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,912
It's a simple yes or no.

472
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:44,518
Hmph. Yeah.

473
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,028
Then my work here is done.

474
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:56,740
Let's see how far we can take this mascot trend.

475
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:59,858
Ooh! How about a talking prolapsed anus?

476
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,469
Some people refuse to learn, huh?

477
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,508
Oh! Look at the bamboo!

478
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,349
Let's write wishes for the Star Festival!

479
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,646
Uhh... What should I wish for?

480
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:13,407
Ah, there we go!

481
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:14,365
This is cool.

482
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,506
Too many, you think?

483
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,986
Seems like kind of a lot, yeah.

484
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:24,011
I mean, it's good to want things, but...

485
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,508
You are not hanging these up!

486
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,041
Oh! I almost forgot!

487
00:21:29,751 --> 00:21:31,351
I want you to tie me up!

488
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:34,579
Ugh. Who hired you?

489
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,962
I'm going to have a look at
what everyone else wished for.

490
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,591
I like Star Festivals.

491
00:21:48,032 --> 00:21:49,488
We all wish for different things,

492
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,701
but the wishing brings us together.

493
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,997
The deal is, none of us gets
to be happy unless we all are.

494
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:00,045
Seems like a good thing to me.

495
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:03,681
No, really. Makes us a family.

496
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,253
Sob Salad.
