00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:09,773
Tamo No-Rin High School, Class 2-A Daily Journal.

2
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:11,525
Entry by Kousaku Hata.

3
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:14,056
Today was pretty typical, actually.

4
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:17,429
Nothing out of the ordinary. Same people, same routine.

5
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,000
Everybody just keeping on keeping on.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,023
Kind of a yawn-fest, really.

7
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:59,863
I helped check out the cornstalks,

8
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:02,505
making sure that bugs or
disease weren't getting to them.

9
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:05,395
Ah... You need something, Yoshida?

10
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:10,614
Hey, what's up? I didn't know you were on corn duty.

11
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,380
Yeah. Me neither.

12
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,577
Not that it particularly matters,

13
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:17,587
but I wonder what you out-of-towners
are doing for summer break?

14
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,511
So far all we know is our training schedule.

15
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:22,139
W-What about Kamatori?

16
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,447
Is he going home? Sticking around?

17
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,252
I don't know.

18
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:27,234
One way to find out, though.

19
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:28,555
Hey, Kei!

20
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,114
Ugh! Dammit! Were you dropped on your head?!

21
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:32,405
Need something, Kousaku?

22
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,414
So what do you got lined up for this summer?

23
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,014
Probably stay on campus and work for a bit.

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,304
We should make a trip down to the beach, yeah?

25
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,572
You want to come with?

26
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:42,389
B... B... You idiot!

27
00:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,864
How dare you invite me to tag along all casual-like?

28
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,139
You've got some nerve!

29
00:02:46,288 --> 00:02:48,364
So, you don't want to go on a beach trip with Kei?

30
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,822
Must we hold this conversation
out in the open for all to see?

31
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:53,625
You are an evil mastermind!

32
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,306
Or an idiot! I can't tell which!

33
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:56,645
Shh!

34
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:05,020
I don't hear any birds.

35
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,295
Or the livestock.

36
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,931
Something's coming. Kei, what is it?

37
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:14,173
Something... inhuman.

38
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:19,815
It's here!

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,400
It's a demon!

40
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:37,103
You like a boy?

41
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:39,306
Where's mine?!

42
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,412
Of course!

43
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,982
It was summoned by Yoshida's obvious love for Kei,

44
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,142
which I totally didn't mean to out, but whatever!

45
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,768
Huh? How's it my fault?!

46
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:48,514
Run for it, Youkul! Go!

47
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,040
Dude, his name's Jun...

48
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,231
Yoshida! Get the girls to school!

49
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,022
I'm on it!

50
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:00,681
Kei! Don't let the cougar-demon touch you, or game over!

51
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:12,745
Horny teacher! Calm your fury!

52
00:04:13,264 --> 00:04:16,439
Whatever you may be, cougar or spinster loli,

53
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,918
these boys are not yours to devour!

54
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,181
Yeah, she ain't gonna like that.

55
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,847
Young love can suck it!

56
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,972
Are you all right, Kei?

57
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:27,473
Yeah!

58
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,819
She's heading for the campus!

59
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,389
The girls are in danger!

60
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:41,966
Ringo... no!

61
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:43,120
Are you okay?!

62
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,014
We'll never catch her!

63
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:49,900
Damn it!

64
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,381
Oh, Youkul!

65
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,049
Still not his name, bro.

66
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:04,627
Kei!

67
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:09,519
Yaaah!

68
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:17,815
All right!

69
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:18,764
You saved us all!

70
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,616
Goodness.

71
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:21,431
She didn't go down easy.

72
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,211
You showed her who's boss!

73
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,764
Yoshida, were you hurt? Are you okay?

74
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,155
Huh?! Of course I'm okay! Why would you even ask?

75
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,139
That's good. Glad to hear it.

76
00:05:31,222 --> 00:05:31,946
Huh...?

77
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:36,413
Wait until your goods start migrating south,

78
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:39,575
Tits McGee. You'll know my suffering soon enough!

79
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,898
Whatever, Teach... you're just jelly.

80
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,406
So, yeah, corn duty was pretty dull.

81
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,352
And homeroom was same old, same old.

82
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,907
Honestly, kind of...

83
00:05:51,736 --> 00:05:52,720
...a bust.

84
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,556
Hey there, little lady.
So what caliber of ammo are you smuggling?

85
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,265
H-cup? Or I?

86
00:05:58,369 --> 00:05:59,411
Damn, they're big.

87
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:01,154
Hey! Don't give them the third-degree!

88
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:02,739
But... I gots to know!

89
00:06:02,764 --> 00:06:03,989
That's enough of that, fella!

90
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:04,878
"Fella?"

91
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,572
You think those sweater-puppies
can be kenneled in a cup-size?

92
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,447
That's like trying to store the Sahara in a litter-box!

93
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,658
Huh?

94
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:19,407
That said, if you want to think about
'em in terms of a cup size, they are...

95
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:23,068
World Cup boobs!

96
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:25,081
World Cup boobs?

97
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:25,787
Duh!

98
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:28,862
No one country can lay claim to such god-tier knockers!

99
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:31,225
Those watermelons are worldwide!

100
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,677
I'll pass!

101
00:06:32,951 --> 00:06:36,340
Big boobs are nothing more than
oversized bags of bovine fat.

102
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:38,452
Really, they do nothing but hinder a woman.

103
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:40,210
Any busty girl will tell you so.

104
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:42,679
Yeah! A-cup forever, haters!

105
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:44,472
Seriously?!

106
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:45,687
Hey, Boss!

107
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,246
You want to drop some knowledge about the itty-bitties?

108
00:06:48,271 --> 00:06:49,781
Don't call me "Boss".

109
00:06:49,806 --> 00:06:51,347
Call me "Big Brother"!

110
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:52,806
What the hell?

111
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,472
Allow me to demolish his worldview.

112
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:57,460
Sure.

113
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:02,056
Men are creatures that wish
to be mothered on some level.

114
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,389
Nothing symbolizes that role as well, as the breast.

115
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:09,390
Ergo, huge breasts are the realm of the real man!

116
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,389
Says you.

117
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,460
What?!

118
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:15,264
The desire for mothering is a real phenomenon.

119
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,614
However... Any self-respecting guy should be well

120
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,425
out of that phase by high school.

121
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,072
As they break away from their parents

122
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,781
and become men in their own right,

123
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,296
a new desire starts to rear its head!

124
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,297
You're overlooking a biological directive!

125
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,222
What is it? Enlighten me, tiny schoolgirl!

126
00:07:33,396 --> 00:07:36,391
Behold! Paternal instinct!

127
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:37,672
Say what?

128
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,994
As a boy grows into a man,

129
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:42,720
he awakens to a new paternal instinct within.

130
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,764
What use has he for teats?

131
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:46,447
Giving a little girl fatherly love

132
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,931
is the most natural of acts for a grown male!

133
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:52,033
Anything less is a case of arrested development!

134
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,931
Yay!

135
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,729
Higher, big brother!

136
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:05,722
Having fun?

137
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:09,903
Uh-huh! I love you, big brother!

138
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:13,933
I admit. Such a scenario is appealing.

139
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:15,764
Yikes...

140
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,578
So, what size do you like?

141
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,429
Huh? Boob-wise?

142
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,615
Mmm...

143
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,759
You know, boobs are nice and
all, but at the end of the day,

144
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,574
I'm more of a foot guy, really.

145
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:27,425
Huh?

146
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:29,415
Yeah.

147
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,545
Like the soles of a girl who's wearing black knee-highs.

148
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:35,822
Or maybe she's been clomping around in shoes all day,

149
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:39,414
and now they're, you know... musty...

150
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:42,329
Are you having fun?

151
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,868
Why, yes... Yes I would
like to rub them for you!

152
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,347
'Sup, guys! How's it hangin'?

153
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,395
C'mon! That was totes adorbs!

154
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,846
You're over forty!

155
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:56,514
How come you're so mean to me? Boo-hoo!

156
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:58,972
I'm trying to be as young and lively as possible!

157
00:08:59,056 --> 00:09:00,066
You've got to respect that!

158
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,517
No, we don't! You look ridiculous!

159
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:06,678
Better to be ridiculous than dead!

160
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,806
My Gaia... Burn them with moe!

161
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:19,713
She's so powerful!
How could a woman her age be so strong?

162
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:22,031
In a world where couples are running amok,

163
00:09:22,056 --> 00:09:24,916
she appears to punish us for their happiness!

164
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:27,204
She fights with the force of a thousand ignored

165
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:29,013
online-dating profiles!

166
00:09:29,038 --> 00:09:32,806
She rises from the ashes of her own
wreck of a love-life again and again!

167
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,056
She is the perpetually-single Phoenix!

168
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:38,836
Run, you fools! Get out of here!

169
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:40,306
Wrong Side of Forty.

170
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:42,056
Genma. Fist!

171
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:49,615
Birth.

172
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:51,534
Kindergarten.

173
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:53,616
Elementary school.

174
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:55,524
Middle school.

175
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,042
High school.

176
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:58,796
College.

177
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,292
Work.

178
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,666
Suddenly, I was forty...

179
00:10:03,764 --> 00:10:06,399
...and just as friggin' lonely as ever...

180
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,401
Even my 13-year-old niece has a boyfriend.

181
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,222
Seriously, life, what the actual hell?

182
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:13,889
Holy crap!

183
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:16,597
Wrinkles! The wrinkles are everywhere!

184
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:19,264
My boobs will be down to my feet!

185
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:21,389
Going out to eat, and every single time

186
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,097
it's the same thing: "Becky, party of one!"

187
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,680
The future... it really sucks!

188
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,421
I never knew that being an adult was so horrible!

189
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,620
It's nothing but loneliness!

190
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:36,150
Day after day, a never-ending parade of suck!

191
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:38,667
We'd all be better off dead!

192
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,597
That took the piss outta ya, huh?!

193
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,010
Now, who loves Becky?

194
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:51,448
Me.

195
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,095
The afternoon class was Home Ec.

196
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,931
"If you make something good to eat...

197
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:02,097
...you'll have 'em lined up down the street."

198
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,369
It's Kousaku's...

199
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:04,097
...and Ringo's...

200
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,506
...cooking show! "Let's Go Home Ec!"

201
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,750
Hey, everybody, you know what time it is.

202
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,389
Let's bring out our guest instructor for the day, yeah?

203
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:19,670
She was top of her class in culinary school,

204
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,990
and won the Worldwide Singles Cooking Contest

205
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,076
22 years in a row! You know her...

206
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:24,947
You love her...

207
00:11:24,972 --> 00:11:25,639
...kind of...

208
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,107
It's Ms. Becky!

209
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:30,363
I say 40 is the new 18!

210
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,466
Well, Ms. Becky, you certainly seem glad to be here.

211
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:37,489
Is that a phone? Come on, you guys.

212
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,670
It's really distracting to
hear that in the middle of a...

213
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:40,895
Oh, my bad.

214
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:41,972
You want to answer it?

215
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,472
That is not a phone!

216
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,389
All-righty!

217
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,014
Today's dish is so good,

218
00:11:46,097 --> 00:11:48,660
just one bite and any man will be yours forever!

219
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,777
Better eat up! This feline's got needs, Hata!

220
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:54,484
Me-Meow!

221
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:56,455
Kill me.

222
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:58,681
Put something in his mouth that he likes.

223
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:02,062
Maybe he'll return the favor! Know what I mean?

224
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,306
Hata, what do you like to eat?

225
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:07,139
I'm not really that picky, but...

226
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,181
I kind of draw the line at natto. I mean, it's so...

227
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:10,681
What the hell do you like to eat?!

228
00:12:10,764 --> 00:12:12,628
It wasn't a hard question, was it?!

229
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,484
Time to shave the tuna, you guys!

230
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,557
Now...

231
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,597
Check it out. Skipjack.

232
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:22,074
No second-rate bonito for you guys.

233
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:24,838
Well, Ringo, how do you think it smells?

234
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:26,889
Like tuna, because it's tuna.

235
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,264
Aw, geez!

236
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,014
Stop the tape! Cut!

237
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,751
We got to take that react again.

238
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,214
Why'd we stop filming?

239
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,479
Oh, come on.

240
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,962
Check the mannequin for a pulse,
'cause that was crappy-crap.

241
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:41,150
I don't think color commentary is Ringo's forte.

242
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:43,534
If you think you can coast by on your fresh face

243
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,545
and thousand-yard-stare,
just sit your bony ass down already!

244
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,681
I don't think we need that for this recipe!

245
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,952
Yeah. Calm your tits.

246
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:58,006
Now, I'll show you how to prep
skipjack tuna the Ms. Becky way!

247
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:05,162
Oh, my... This thing has such a musky odor to it.

248
00:13:05,597 --> 00:13:07,825
But I... kind of like it.

249
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,931
Wow. There's something on the tip!

250
00:13:13,014 --> 00:13:15,364
Is that what I think it is, you naughty skipjack... ?

251
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:16,438
No, it's not!

252
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:18,797
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:21,039
I guess I got a little ahead of myself.

254
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,019
Get it? "A little head?"

255
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:27,597
Hey, Hata! Want to be a pal and shave this down?

256
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,880
Aw. I'm going to be sad to see you go, mister skipjack.

257
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:31,411
You're like a giant di...

258
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,044
Kousaku reporting in for shaving duty!

259
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:36,656
Shave, shave, shave...

260
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:38,063
Faster, faster!

261
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,681
Shave, shave, shave...

262
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,239
Don't be so rough.

263
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:42,386
Shave... Shave...

264
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,114
Gimme a Latin beat!

265
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:45,056
Shave, sh-sha-shave

266
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:46,531
Right, now show me your O-face!

267
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:47,683
What is your problem?!

268
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:51,306
After that, you fill up a bowl with white rice!

269
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:54,364
Here. Knock yourself out.

270
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,513
Then, you grab a big bottle of sauce!

271
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:58,597
So what're we making here, anyway?

272
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,497
What the... ?

273
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:04,688
Rice bowl... voila! Loved up and good to go!

274
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,031
Isn't that a bit too simple for a cooking show?

275
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:10,264
Ah-ah-ah! There's no point going crazy in the kitchen

276
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:12,322
when you're the only one who's going to be eating

277
00:14:12,347 --> 00:14:14,224
the final product, right?

278
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,576
Here's the reality.

279
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:21,491
On any given day, you just go from your
apartment to work and then back home again.

280
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,739
At work, your so-called peers

281
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,014
avoid you like the plague. And they somehow forget

282
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:32,083
to invite you to their parties every damn time.

283
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,264
When you get home, you're too tired to do anything

284
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:37,389
but flop into bed and sleep in your makeup,

285
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:40,306
'cause that's a good idea. On your rare days off,

286
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,806
you spend all your time being lazy and farting around

287
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:45,868
on the internet. Why bother cooking for reals?

288
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:47,794
Now what do you think?

289
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,293
I think white rice with toppings is okay.

290
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,014
On to another topic!

291
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:59,151
When you're cooking, there are five
seasonings that are fundamental.

292
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,889
Ringo, would you care to list them off

293
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,520
with that perfect little poker face of yours?

294
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:08,592
Sugar is one of them. Salt is, too. Vinegar also.

295
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,343
And then...

296
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:09,788
And then?!

297
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,009
Huh? Uh...

298
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:11,882
Ur-urrr!

299
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:14,222
Sugar, salt, vinegar, der-der-der!

300
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:17,056
Der-der-der! Bwalala!

301
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,514
Enough smack-talk!

302
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,097
The other two are soy sauce and miso, now aren't they?

303
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,138
Miso horny!

304
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:26,647
Hey wait, isn't it a turn-on for guys

305
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:28,360
when they see a girl cooking for them?

306
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,889
No way! That's just...

307
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:38,013
You're home! Take me!

308
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,392
Ms. Becky, it's high time we
got down to making it, yeah?

309
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:42,433
What, a baby?

310
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,431
No, the food!

311
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:46,068
Okay, then! I'll get the cutting board!

312
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:50,378
Sorry about that, Ringo! My mistake!

313
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,781
Your chest is so flat,

314
00:15:51,806 --> 00:15:53,322
I guess I thought it was the cutting-board!

315
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,764
Goodness, I am such a bonehead!

316
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:58,168
Maybe she'll have some boobs when she's older!

317
00:15:58,588 --> 00:16:00,826
And for dessert, we'll make delicious strawberries

318
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,879
topped with condensed milk!

319
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,434
Wash and drain the berries, then put them in a bowl.

320
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,389
Then pour on the condensed milk and you're golden!

321
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,222
This stuff doesn't even count as cooking anymore.

322
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,031
Oh! And there I go again!

323
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,906
I meant to reach for the condensed milk,

324
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:19,014
and I went for the condensed boobies!

325
00:16:19,097 --> 00:16:20,514
I mean, just look at them!

326
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:22,347
Go to your happy place!

327
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,931
The only reason I seem flat is because of Chubs

328
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:26,681
and the Boob Monster over there!

329
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:27,847
Don't call me "Chubs!"

330
00:16:27,931 --> 00:16:29,722
What the hell?! "Boob Monster?!"

331
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,222
What's the matter, Ms. Becky?

332
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,597
You're really letting Ringo have it this afternoon.

333
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:34,942
'Cause I'm jealous, dammit!

334
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,514
Lay off the milk, okay?

335
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:37,797
Listen up, new girl!

336
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:39,097
Don't go getting full of yourself

337
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:40,203
just 'cause you're young!

338
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,889
Before you got here, the boys were all in love with me!

339
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,639
What world are you living in?

340
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:45,602
Kiss me, gorgeous!

341
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,663
I don't wanna!

342
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:47,799
So be it.

343
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:51,264
I'll just cook up your little crush, then!

344
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:53,097
You're on the menu, missy!

345
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:57,465
Today's special is Ringo breast, if I can find any meat!

346
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,179
Take your best shot, Grandma.

347
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:03,178
I don't think this is helpful!

348
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:04,823
Stand down, ladies!

349
00:17:05,764 --> 00:17:08,097
When you have a dispute in the realm of home ec,

350
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:11,591
you settle it with a cook-off showdown!

351
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,893
Chef One! Ms. Kinoshita!

352
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,226
Miso soup?

353
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,764
Soup is pretty simple.

354
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:24,338
I don't know if this is going to do it.

355
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:27,014
Well, nobody said it had to be flashy.

356
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,985
It's just tofu, right?

357
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,312
We all like red miso a lot, so I'm glad she used it!

358
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,301
Good call there, Ringo!

359
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,209
Now, for the moment of truth!

360
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,588
What am I tasting?!

361
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:46,806
There's a strong fishiness to it, like a seafood stock,

362
00:17:46,889 --> 00:17:49,449
and a smell that's making my eyes water!

363
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:52,097
The flavor is so rich, and so powerful!

364
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:54,543
It's almost too much, but there's something about it

365
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,764
that I just can't get out of my mind!

366
00:17:56,847 --> 00:18:00,847
This bowl is a chalice given to us by the gods of miso,

367
00:18:00,931 --> 00:18:04,556
and the blessed broth within
is a miracle to be cherished!

368
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,597
Is he nuts? I can't take another sip of this stuff.

369
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,514
It's sour, and kind of fishy.

370
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:12,722
It makes me feel all barfy.

371
00:18:12,806 --> 00:18:13,806
Ringo!

372
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:16,693
What perfect food did you use to make this soup?

373
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,409
Old slippers.

374
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:22,568
You know that brown part of the insole?

375
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,410
Yeah, I mostly used that.

376
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:26,181
You cured my foot kink!

377
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:28,233
It made the soup stock really brown.

378
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,656
So the red miso you tossed in just for color?

379
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,109
Hey, you guys.

380
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,846
Can we name Becky the winner so I can go and throw up?

381
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,148
Yeah, no kidding. Whatever she made,

382
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:41,264
it's got to be better than this
foot-soup Ringo hit us with.

383
00:18:41,347 --> 00:18:44,642
Not a chance. We have to try both for it to be fair.

384
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,395
Ms. Becky, it's your turn.

385
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:48,370
You're gonna like my dish.

386
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,722
I have every confidence you'll be coming back for more!

387
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:55,197
Huh? Just rice?

388
00:18:55,222 --> 00:18:57,739
So, uh, what about a side dish?

389
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:01,341
That is the side! Here's the main course!

390
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,946
That's disgusting! Kill it with fire!

391
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,764
Well. Hurry up and eat.

392
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:14,400
Or else the best-by date will pass you by

393
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:17,103
That best by date's long gone!

394
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,514
You are a teacher, you nymphomaniac!

395
00:19:19,597 --> 00:19:21,441
How have they not fired you yet?

396
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:25,357
Daddy's a big-shot politician. I'm not going anywhere!

397
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,202
Now all the mysteries are solved!

398
00:19:27,227 --> 00:19:29,764
Come on, class! No need to be shy!

399
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:31,389
Here. Eat Ms. Becky!

400
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:32,597
Just do it!

401
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,847
That's a good class. Don't worry.

402
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:41,681
There is plenty of Becky to go around!

403
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:45,597
Huh? Uh, hold up.
This is not what I had in mind, fellas!

404
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:47,139
Heave-ho!

405
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:51,695
Not the going down I wanted... !

406
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:57,239
"If you make something good to eat...

407
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,347
...you'll have them lined up down the street."

408
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,875
'Til next time. "Let's Go Home Ec!"

409
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:10,597
So, there you have it.

410
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,571
Just another ordinary, average day like any other.

411
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:17,890
Kind of dull, actually. Well, there was that thing

412
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,008
that happened on the way back
from our shopping trip, I guess.

413
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,144
Is this it?

414
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:25,578
Mm-hmm.

415
00:20:25,989 --> 00:20:28,054
Minotamo Rock Festival, huh?

416
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,444
If we get up to the stage and it looks like fun,

417
00:20:30,514 --> 00:20:32,889
you guys maybe want to go up there and give it a shot?

418
00:20:33,036 --> 00:20:35,822
We've never played in a band
together before... I don't know.

419
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:38,739
Well, I think the five of us could
fake our way through something.

420
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:42,128
She's right. If you're really
worried about how we'd sound,

421
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:45,124
then we could always go with
the visual kei route, you know.

422
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,610
We can even disguise Kinoshita,
if we go heavy on the make-up.

423
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:49,989
Visual kei, huh?

424
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:51,866
Yeah, sounds like fun!

425
00:20:52,306 --> 00:20:54,072
We are gonna look so cool!

426
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:57,216
I'm going to irrigate your soul!

427
00:20:57,448 --> 00:20:58,529
That could be a song!

428
00:20:58,582 --> 00:20:59,162
Nope.

429
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:03,889
That stage is pretty small.

430
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,662
Just the right size for a bunch of noobs like us!

431
00:21:06,722 --> 00:21:08,963
That's the spirit! Let's do it!

432
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,722
All right, folks, our next act is called AKB40!

433
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,306
I thought it was 48.

434
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,352
Isn't that?

435
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:22,597
Hey, guys! I missed you so much!

436
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,281
Ms. Becky?!

437
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,131
Now I get it! That wasn't a mistake!

438
00:21:27,306 --> 00:21:29,014
AKB40 means... !

439
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,889
Ancient! Teacher! Becky! Age 40!

440
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:38,222
Here comes my latest song! "Give me a Man... Now!"

441
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:04,764
<i>You and I now share the same last name,</i>

442
00:22:04,847 --> 00:22:10,764
<i>No mistaking it's a different game.</i>

443
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:16,014
<i>"Catch ya' later's" just so hard to own;</i>

444
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:22,764
<i>Think I'd much prefer you said, "Honey, I'm home."</i>

445
00:22:22,847 --> 00:22:28,764
<i>I'll wait patiently for you to shamble through the door.</i>

446
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:32,972
<i>Did I just hear a key in the lock?</i>

447
00:22:33,056 --> 00:22:37,764
<i>Can I finally take my eyes off the clock?</i>

448
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:40,889
<i>Someone marry me!</i>

449
00:22:40,972 --> 00:22:43,889
<i>I'm a catch, you'll see!</i>

450
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:49,806
<i>I'm so sick of chasing men from sea to shining sea!</i>

451
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,889
<i>Bachelor's hear my plea:</i>

452
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,931
<i>Take a chance with me!</i>

453
00:22:56,014 --> 00:23:02,873
<i>Sweep me off my feet and let this ponytail fly free!</i>

454
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:09,639
Thanks, you guys!

455
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:10,965
You're such a swell audience!

456
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,705
What was that...?

457
00:23:12,764 --> 00:23:14,306
That just happened, right?

458
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:15,132
Receptions.

459
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,747
She's dealt with two decades of wedding karaoke.

460
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:23,228
Howled her needs into a mic time after time.

461
00:23:23,556 --> 00:23:24,308
Think about it.

462
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:27,929
Is it so odd that she'd have a
couple of songs up her sleeve?

463
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:29,241
Not at all.

464
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:32,874
This next one is called: "Old People Smell Funny!"

465
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:34,431
One, two, thr... !

466
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:38,595
School Swim Trunks.
