1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,386
Oh, I see...

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:06,636
You want to know if the new transfer
is the girl of your dreams, eh?

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:07,901
Adorable.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,900
Wait for it...

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,566
Miss Becky!

6
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:15,270
It's not so simple as yes or no.

7
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,269
Please, you're killing us!

8
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,962
So, Yukatan.

9
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:20,600
That is who you are, right?

10
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:22,301
You'll have to excuse him.

11
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:24,636
What he means is, you're that singer chick, right?

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,745
Not really.

13
00:00:26,073 --> 00:00:27,656
Why you slumming it in this dive?

14
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,153
I don't know.

15
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:30,750
Uh, all-righty then.

16
00:00:31,418 --> 00:00:32,885
Truth is:

17
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:38,137
The new girl was pop sensation Yuka Kusakabe,
but now she goes by Ringo Kinoshita.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:38,997
Called it!

19
00:00:39,303 --> 00:00:40,294
Not so fast!

20
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:40,669
Huh?

21
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:45,261
It's safe to assume she enrolled here under a
new name to put the billboard days behind her.

22
00:00:45,423 --> 00:00:46,747
Ah. I get it.

23
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:48,507
So, no bringing up her past then.

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,406
Right.

25
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,753
But...

26
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:52,357
Come on!

27
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:56,236
Don't translate that to mean "avoid her
altogether." The poor dear needs help adjusting!

28
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,555
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:02,243
You want us to help this Ringo,
whatever-her-name is, fit in? It'll be perfect!

30
00:01:02,268 --> 00:01:04,229
She's in the same dorm as you all.

31
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:05,215
What?

32
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,761
Plus you have the same major
and you're in the same class.

33
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:10,185
Oh, wow. How intelligent of me!

34
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,675
Let me get this straight:

35
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,752
We'll be attached at the hip?

36
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,549
So, like, on the farm?

37
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,167
And-And in the classroom?

38
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,477
And where 'at the hip' can be taken literally?!

39
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:21,928
I'm dreaming this, aren't I?

40
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:23,128
No, it's real.

41
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:28,517
Nosebleed!

42
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,195
Pleased to meet you, Miss Yukata... !

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,395
Uh, sorry, I mean: Miss Kinoshita.

44
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,939
Ha. I'm Kousaku Hata, so, uh, hi.

45
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:08,445
Right, right.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,587
Give me a sec.

47
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:11,653
This is my friend. Wakadanna.

48
00:03:11,678 --> 00:03:13,173
Or... Young Master.

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,137
Anyway.

50
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:19,351
Let me be the first to welcome you to Tamo
No-Rin, where everyone's a team player!

51
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,178
Is he talking like a recruiter or is it just me?

52
00:03:23,283 --> 00:03:25,345
Um, I think he's trying to sound smart.

53
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:26,511
Tour-time!

54
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,282
There'll be a quiz afterwards-not really.

55
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:29,928
This is the main building.

56
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,240
Classes are divided up by department.

57
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,095
Here we have the gym.

58
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:39,886
The complex of buildings to our
right has kind of a tricky name.

59
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,224
We call it the Industrial Promotion Building.
Bit of a mouthful, huh?

60
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:47,553
There's the Green Shop, like the sign says.

61
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:50,345
That's where we sell all of our vegetables and stuff.

62
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:51,424
I know.

63
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:53,803
Uh... Ah, cool.

64
00:03:56,428 --> 00:03:57,303
A cat?

65
00:03:57,464 --> 00:03:58,237
Uh...

66
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,750
No, that'd be a peacock.

67
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,581
It's so drab.

68
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:07,386
Oh. Right, I get you.

69
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,011
See when we think of a peacock, we think of the males.

70
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,886
In nature, it's the guys who
have to deck themselves out.

71
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:16,956
Girls are... Drab.

72
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,420
Nice move, doofus! You're losing her!

73
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:24,074
This is the Wallaby House.

74
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:25,958
It's where Wakadana lives.

75
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,570
Heated flooring, AC...

76
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,928
It's actually a lot nicer than our dorms.

77
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,258
So, Wakadana's not a kangaroo?

78
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,095
Well, they are similar, but not quite the same.

79
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,194
So, uh...

80
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,005
Yeah.

81
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:45,935
If you're interested, I could tell you about how
Wakadana and me became buddies back in the day.

82
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,070
He didn't used to be attached to us.

83
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:51,000
But then one night, actually,
it was Christmas just last year.

84
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:55,820
Either 'cause he was tired of being cooped up
or just couldn't sleep, the little fella got out

85
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,794
and wandered around in the snow until, well,

86
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,226
until it got to be too much for him.

87
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,495
Luckily, I was wandering
around myself and found him.

88
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:07,610
Took him to my room as fast as I could.

89
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,633
He slept cuddled up next to me inside my...

90
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,782
Uh... Inside a big pillowcase.

91
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,570
We've been pals ever since.

92
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:18,631
When he gets bored,

93
00:05:18,656 --> 00:05:20,766
he comes over to hang out with me and the gang.

94
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,957
Pretty heartwarming story, huh?

95
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,915
Continuing the tour!

96
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:31,625
Feast your eyes on that!

97
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:35,389
That's what quality poultry looks
like when it's too good for plebeians!

98
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:37,595
The three breeds of locally raised poultry are:

99
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,647
Hinai, Nagoya Cochin, and the superlative Satsuma.

100
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:45,380
Less famous, perhaps, but of equal merit is the
poultry raised here in our very own Gifu prefecture

101
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:47,553
submitted for your unqualified appraisal.

102
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,651
Very nice. Let's eat!

103
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:51,990
Well done. Thank you.

104
00:05:52,272 --> 00:05:52,917
Why...

105
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:58,257
Don't speak to me as though my self-esteem as an
animal husbandry specialist hinges on your approval!

106
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:01,629
Consider yourself blessed that I deign
to let you sample my wares at all!

107
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,438
She's so mean. Why?

108
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,075
I beg your pardon?!

109
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:09,386
If you're trying to insinuate that I have unrequited
feelings for Kei, you're barking up the wrong tree!

110
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,839
That's not to suggest I haven't
a modicum of respect for the man.

111
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,772
But I regard him primarily as a rival!

112
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:16,937
Uh, any chance I can have some eggs?

113
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:18,987
Vulgarian...

114
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,322
Let me ask you.

115
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:22,308
Between fertilized and unfertilized,

116
00:06:22,345 --> 00:06:24,754
which kind of egg is more, I guess, you know,

117
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:25,761
better for you?

118
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,386
Moron!

119
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:30,399
How do you call yourself an
Ag Major and sleep at night?!

120
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,053
Nutritionally, there is no difference between the two.

121
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,861
That said, let there be no question that eggs produced
by caged fowl, when compared to those produced

122
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:41,112
by the free-range variety,
are enormously less delectable.

123
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,044
Sorry. Thanks for explaining.

124
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,797
Hey.

125
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,048
"Unfertilized egg" means what?

126
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,435
Look.

127
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,136
I'm from the city, okay?
I don't know the first thing about eggs.

128
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,250
Wow, that is seriously adorable!

129
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:55,325
This stuff is so... boring.

130
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,055
No!

131
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,955
Anyway...

132
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,448
Unfertilized, means?

133
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:02,220
Well, I, uh...

134
00:07:02,282 --> 00:07:04,270
Give me a sec to explain!

135
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:05,437
Okay, I'm not going to lie:

136
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,210
I don't even know where to start on this one.

137
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,710
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:10,720
You know this: just start from the beginning.

139
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,136
Look at her! She's too delicate!

140
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:14,144
This is down and dirty stuff she's asking about.

141
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:15,778
I can't just go there.

142
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,803
Oh, spare me! It's a clinical matter.

143
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,570
Be clinical. The principle's the same for plants.

144
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:22,195
Think, pistil and stamen.

145
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:25,092
What I think is that she ought
to hear it from another girl.

146
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:25,905
Fine!

147
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,272
Behold, rookie!

148
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,016
Yeah?

149
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,306
If you would, madam.

150
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:31,352
Your undivided attention.

151
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:32,332
Yes!

152
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,178
An unfertilized egg is essentially
an egg wearing a condom!

153
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,426
The first order of business when it
comes to Agriculture is record keeping.

154
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:46,011
That's the last time I ask Fun
Bags to explain anything to anyone.

155
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,553
Sweetie, you've heard the phrase "putting
all your eggs in one basket," yes?

156
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,570
Fertilizing them?

157
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,863
No, not exactly.

158
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:55,355
What I'm getting at here is the
importance of playing fast and loose!

159
00:07:56,262 --> 00:08:02,194
What the experts say about the same-old, same-old is
true. For example: When a grown man practices monogamy.

160
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,113
Yeah, right.

161
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,928
His wife...

162
00:08:03,953 --> 00:08:04,940
Whoa, there!

163
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:07,335
Kind of an inappropriate example, don't you think?

164
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,045
What? She's a girl. She needs to know.

165
00:08:10,638 --> 00:08:12,675
You might be going off on a tangent.

166
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:14,720
The point I'm getting at is,

167
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:18,511
when we re-use the same soil year after
year, eventually the crop won't take.

168
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,580
The concept is known as replant failure.

169
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,028
Simple as that.

170
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:22,508
Huh?

171
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,803
Replant failure! Simple as that!

172
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,640
Yes. Thank you! Awesome!

173
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,574
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to propose a toast.

174
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:35,191
As dorm leader, it's my privilege to
welcome Miss Kinoshita into the fold.

175
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,117
We're very happy to

176
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,411
Dang it, guys!

177
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,941
I vote we stuff our faces! Heh.

178
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:43,154
There's really not a whole heck of a
lot to do in a po-dunk town like this.

179
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,094
But, there's enough fresh grub to feed an army!

180
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,719
This is way too much for me.

181
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:48,183
Oh. Well...

182
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:53,301
Is it just me, or is she being kind of bitchy?

183
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:56,871
Come on! Give her chance.
She's probably just nervous. Wouldn't you be?

184
00:08:56,951 --> 00:09:00,814
Maybe, but either way, you wouldn't be the
only human being I bothered talking to.

185
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,119
Heh heh! Ah... You noticed that, huh?

186
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,844
Ugh. Please! Idiot.

187
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,250
Her attitude's not exactly going to help her fit in.

188
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:10,585
Look, if your girlfriend wants to cut it
here, she needs to learn how to play ball!

189
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,328
Huh. Guess you have a point.

190
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:16,932
What you need to do is stop fan-boying long
enough to set an example. Quit trying to schmooze,

191
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,521
and get her familiar with how things work.

192
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:21,436
I know that, I'm just... I'm establishing trust.

193
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:24,761
Who wants to see an impression?

194
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:26,092
Ha! Yeah!

195
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,858
Helium-filled sex doll.

196
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,058
Woo-hoo!

197
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,742
I have daddy issues.

198
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:40,928
Woo-hoo...

199
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,271
Yeah... Woo-hoo...

200
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,412
All right, then. Another one.

201
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,219
I give you "cock of the walk!"

202
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,673
Nope!

203
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,094
Overreact there much, chief?

204
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,733
No more impressions! It's game time!

205
00:09:56,758 --> 00:10:00,001
In fact, why don't we let the new
girl pick what she'd like to play?

206
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:00,941
Uh...

207
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,767
How about "Who's the King?"

208
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,095
Huh?

209
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:07,536
Red straw's the King!

210
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,980
Ha-ha! The red one's mine!

211
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,869
Kei's got one. Pretty sure that
signal means Minori has three.

212
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:21,426
Yes! This is my chance!

213
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:25,696
As King, I command whoever has
Number Two to feed me by hand!

214
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:28,633
Oh. Glad that's not weird.

215
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:31,625
Damn it! How did you end up with Number Two?!

216
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,469
I'm not any happier about it than you are!

217
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:35,511
I was trying to signal you that Ringo had three.

218
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:36,744
if it'd been a snake, it would've bit you!

219
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,494
Your secret code is stupid!

220
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:43,886
Quit stalling and play the game.

221
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,319
The King asked to be fed.

222
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:47,916
Your Highness...

223
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:48,934
Ahh...

224
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:50,637
Heh...

225
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,477
Glad we're not playing spin-the-bottle, huh?

226
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:56,164
Sorry...

227
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:59,750
Red straw's the King!

228
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:06,011
Tee-hee.

229
00:11:06,036 --> 00:11:08,192
Yes. Exactly as planned.

230
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,762
As king, I command Number Three
to step on my face barefoot!

231
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:14,490
Ugh. Is something wrong with you or do you just hate me?

232
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:15,703
No!

233
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:18,955
I... hate my life!

234
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,136
If you're going to signal me, be consistent!

235
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:23,105
Uh-uh, don't pin this one on me!

236
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,844
Did you or did you not say my
secret code was stupid last time?

237
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,206
Whatever, just do it!

238
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:28,277
Step on my face!

239
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,483
You really need to see a therapist at some point.

240
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,829
Let's get this over with...

241
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,250
Do it quick.

242
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,877
I don't know what this is doing
for you and I don't need to know.

243
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:51,321
Let's just agree never to speak of this again.

244
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:53,161
You're a good sport, Minori. Heh.

245
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,244
You know what they say, "the more you stomp
it, the bigger the barley grows."

246
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,850
Nobody says that.

247
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:00,465
Okay, that's enough!

248
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:01,786
Right. That looked bad.

249
00:12:01,982 --> 00:12:02,822
But... I swear!

250
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,126
Sorry...

251
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,786
Red straw's the King!

252
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,242
Looks like it's me.

253
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,303
Oh. Yay.

254
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:14,244
It's you.

255
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:15,283
Huh. Nice...

256
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,560
Uh, is something the matter?

257
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:20,967
No, I'm good.

258
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,507
What're you?

259
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,356
Huh?

260
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,953
What number do you have?

261
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:27,844
I can't just tell you! That takes the fun out of it.

262
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,624
What number do you have?

263
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:33,147
Eh! Uhm... One. But this is against the rules.

264
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,623
Number One has to call me by my first name.

265
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:44,292
You... You'd be okay with that?

266
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,261
I mean, we only just met.

267
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,701
It's Ringo, by the way.

268
00:12:47,744 --> 00:12:49,491
Yeah... I-I know.

269
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:50,753
Good.

270
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,401
Call me that from now on.

271
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:58,409
Ringo. Nice "ring" to it. Heh.

272
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:01,559
What the... ?! Oh no!

273
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,578
Morning, Waka. Oh, that's right: it's Sunday.

274
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:17,916
More playtime.

275
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,220
Man. Wait 'til you get a load of the dream I had.

276
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,619
Last night, I thought Yuka transferred here from Tokyo

277
00:13:23,683 --> 00:13:25,207
and was totally putting the moves on me

278
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:26,987
while we were playing "Who's the Ki... ".

279
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:34,245
What?

280
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:35,808
Nothing!

281
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,130
Just thinking about how awesome Ghibli is, you know?

282
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,361
What are you doing?

283
00:13:41,178 --> 00:13:42,089
Laundry.

284
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:43,775
Ah... I see.

285
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,594
What?

286
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,313
Uh... Nothing! Ha!

287
00:13:54,347 --> 00:13:56,971
So, if you're having trouble figuring this monster out,

288
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,500
and it is complicated, I could help?

289
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:03,396
I can do it on my own, thank you. But if you want.

290
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:04,556
Right.

291
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:07,331
Look, the first thing you need to learn is how to ask.

292
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,947
Nevermind.

293
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,286
I'll wash them in the river.

294
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:15,703
Look, I don't know what they teach you in
the concrete jungle, but we're rustic here,

295
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,892
not Neanderthal. We'll use the washing machine!

296
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:22,255
First thing we do is separate colors from delicates.

297
00:14:22,592 --> 00:14:23,146
Oohh...

298
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:24,956
"Delicate" means "white," basically.

299
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,286
Everything else is "color."

300
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,495
After that, we divvy up by material.

301
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,659
Go on, I believe in you!

302
00:14:30,684 --> 00:14:31,999
Here goes!

303
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:36,170
Wait! Are you cool with me watching you do this?

304
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:36,584
Huh?

305
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:40,119
It's just, you know,
I'm seeing your underwear and all!

306
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:44,036
You embarrassed?

307
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,601
Heck no! But, I mean, aren't you?

308
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,693
Whatever, I'm a modern guy!
If it's fine by you, it's fine by me.

309
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,257
Which pile do these go into?

310
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:53,786
Ah. Panties.

311
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,327
Technically, you could go either way.

312
00:14:56,414 --> 00:15:00,346
Uh... 'cause they're color!

313
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:02,095
And delicate!

314
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:03,856
What do we do?

315
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:05,682
Hand-wash.

316
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:06,724
Seriously?

317
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:07,435
Yup.

318
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:09,678
Washing machine would be way too rough on them.

319
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:12,733
Then again, if you've never hand-washed
something before, it can be challenging.

320
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,342
You think so? Really?

321
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:18,403
Oh yeah. Fortunately for you,
I'm experienced with these things.

322
00:15:18,496 --> 00:15:21,078
I'd be happy to help! Come to daddy!

323
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:23,515
Come to daddy, my precious.

324
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:27,803
I am so going to OD!

325
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,419
Step away from the unmentionables, you pervert!

326
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:31,257
So close...

327
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,282
Ugh! Leave the poor girl alone!

328
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,807
Like it or not, a woman has the
right to launder her undies in peace!

329
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,550
Wait. He's not doing anything wrong.

330
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:40,703
I just asked for his help with my clothes.

331
00:15:41,045 --> 00:15:43,369
I couldn't figure out the washing machine, okay?

332
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,411
Look, take my word for it, I know the guy:

333
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:46,678
he's a ticking time bomb.

334
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:47,969
I've earned the right to say that

335
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:49,469
'cause I've put up with his creeper man-games

336
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,928
since we were kids, alright?

337
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,963
You've known the perv for, what? A whole day?

338
00:15:52,988 --> 00:15:54,481
Oh, I'm sorry, I called your man a "perv."

339
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:57,537
What the hell is your problem?

340
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:58,830
Me?

341
00:15:59,119 --> 00:15:59,876
Yes, you.

342
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:00,786
Oh yeah?

343
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:01,747
Yeah.

344
00:16:03,305 --> 00:16:05,178
Okay, okay I like a good catfight

345
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:07,869
as much as the next guy,
but this is getting on my nerves!

346
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,280
Stop being a queen bee and give her panties back!

347
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:11,636
Every second you have them in your paws

348
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:14,139
they drop in purity by a whole order of magnitude!

349
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,118
You're saying I'm impure?!

350
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,136
Bravo! Give the girl a prize!

351
00:16:18,282 --> 00:16:21,136
Once upon a time, men wrote hymns
to underwear this wholesome!

352
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,470
Thunder pants like yours- they burned at the stake!

353
00:16:24,305 --> 00:16:25,744
Ah... Wow. Nice one.

354
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:29,113
You really put these panties on a
pedestal, huh? Unbelievable.

355
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,012
Just shut up and hand them over!

356
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:32,803
Wait. I have a better idea.

357
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,366
I'll go you one better.

358
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,063
You... If you...

359
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,411
If you want them, hers and mine are a package deal!

360
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,428
Ew! Gross!

361
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:48,053
Oh, you have got to be kidding me!

362
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:49,715
Don't be such a drama queen!

363
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,972
If you're going to force me to take
your skid-marked parachute undies,

364
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:55,011
at least hand me the snow white pair first!

365
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:56,578
Parachute undies...?

366
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,361
Quit bitching and give them here!

367
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,015
Ha! Over my dead body!

368
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,652
Nope!

369
00:17:00,745 --> 00:17:03,965
If all you're going to do is fight over
them, just give them back to me.

370
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,563
Could everyone calm down, please?

371
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:13,264
This is stupid. I heard everything.

372
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,286
You should all be ashamed!

373
00:17:15,423 --> 00:17:17,930
Clearly, there's only one way
to settle this issue properly.

374
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,913
Excuse me? Like how?

375
00:17:21,286 --> 00:17:23,233
We test your expertise!

376
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,328
It's like looking into the sun!

377
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,844
Here's the deal: pick the
highest quality pair of panties

378
00:17:28,869 --> 00:17:30,953
from the selection you see here, and you win.

379
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,578
Winner gets two things: my undying respect,

380
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,536
and bragging rights as the foremost
authority on ladies' undies.

381
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:37,980
Hmm...

382
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:43,094
These look pretty swanky.

383
00:17:43,175 --> 00:17:44,897
Cute. Totally what I would have picked.

384
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,703
Great minds think alike, huh?

385
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:48,796
Right.

386
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,119
I'm going with these 'cause they're
what I'd choose to wear myself.

387
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,456
Ha! Read them and weep, loser-boy!

388
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:54,453
I was f...king with you.

389
00:17:55,744 --> 00:17:57,240
C'mon, that's not how the game is played!

390
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,098
Us girls got to stick together!

391
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:01,866
Whatever, these are absolutely the ones!

392
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:04,828
You know jack about quality.

393
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,288
At the end of the day,
it's not about cuteness or comfort.

394
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:08,703
Oh. Is that a fact?

395
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:10,038
Nice try, Kei,

396
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:12,105
but your little setup here doesn't fool me.

397
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,244
I... choose none!

398
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:18,552
Not a single pair on this table has ever been worn!

399
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,744
Oh...? Huh?

400
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:25,170
Guys couldn't care less about
sheer fabric or frilly little bows.

401
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:29,664
They care about whether or not the panties have
ever gotten down and dirty in the trenches!

402
00:18:30,237 --> 00:18:33,217
Unworn pairs of ladies'
undergarments are a dime a dozen!

403
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:34,612
Hmph!

404
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:40,379
Well, who am I to argue the basic economics with a
man who'd give his left nut to sniff a used pair?

405
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,369
In most cases, the reverse is true, but with panties,

406
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,453
used versus unused can mean the difference between

407
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:46,993
several decimal points.

408
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,659
But what we're actually talking about

409
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:50,545
isn't the panties themselves.

410
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:54,639
But the sexual commodification of the wearer!

411
00:18:58,286 --> 00:19:00,619
If you would hand me the pair
you have in your hands, please.

412
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:03,304
Sure. There's no question who's the expert.

413
00:19:03,494 --> 00:19:05,244
You've, definitely earned these.

414
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:07,899
Ah-ha! Yeah!

415
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:09,728
Get ready, nose!

416
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:16,435
Sorry! You've lost, pal!

417
00:19:16,902 --> 00:19:19,283
I'll bet you thought those belonged to Kinoshita.

418
00:19:20,422 --> 00:19:21,858
But they're mine!

419
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,259
They... They're what?!

420
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:28,394
I've had them bunched up under my
armpit for the past five minutes.

421
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:29,369
That's right.

422
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:32,930
Nobody said anything to anyone
about them being your dream girl's.

423
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,767
These, on the other hand!

424
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,057
So I basically just buried my nose in your...

425
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:42,392
Afraid so.

426
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:44,244
How could you?

427
00:19:44,328 --> 00:19:46,437
I thought you were my friend?

428
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:50,285
You've tricked me! Why?

429
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:52,828
What have I done to deserve this...?

430
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,488
This was all on purpose!

431
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,369
Bastard! You knew exactly what you were doing!

432
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:02,866
You've turned this laundry room into a den of lies!

433
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,644
C'mon, man get a grip, already.

434
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:12,911
Let this be a lesson to you that not all used panties
have seen the kind of trenches you're interested in.

435
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:13,967
Then tell me....

436
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,733
How's a man supposed to judge quality?

437
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,536
There's no surefire way.

438
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,963
Value is in the eye of the beholder.

439
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,369
Why do you sound like a guru all of a sudden?

440
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,703
I don't understand.

441
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:27,012
Consider this:

442
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,661
Stop thinking in terms of the panties themselves.

443
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:32,821
The only pair worth its weight
in gold is the pair unseen.

444
00:20:33,494 --> 00:20:36,491
The one thing we're drawn to without fail is mystery.

445
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,536
Once we've seen them they're
just a run-o'-the-mill fact.

446
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:42,605
What they are is nothing
compared to what they represent.

447
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,630
That's really deep...

448
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,828
So, one in the hand is...

449
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:50,749
Is worth none in the bush.

450
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,670
Wow, I... I was jerk.

451
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:57,363
Sorry I threw them away.

452
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,489
I didn't understand their panty power.

453
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,790
Nah, I was the jerk.

454
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:04,023
I didn't understand any better than you.

455
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:05,485
There, that's the spirit.

456
00:21:05,524 --> 00:21:07,246
Glad you two remember how to be friends.

457
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:08,542
Since my work's done,

458
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:10,244
I'll be taking Kinoshita's panties for myself.

459
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:11,119
What?!

460
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,370
You dirty double-crossing... !

461
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:15,911
Stop belly-aching! You already have your own!

462
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:17,578
Huh? What are you talking about?

463
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:20,661
The ones in your heart...

464
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:25,654
Of course!

465
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,829
They've been with me from the beginning!

466
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:32,357
Everyone carries their own high-quality pair
of ladies' unmentionables in their heart!

467
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,994
Guys! Let's hang these up like banners and have a party!

468
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,494
A Spring-line Panties Party!

469
00:21:39,578 --> 00:21:41,433
I'll make my special red rice!

470
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:44,328
Yo, sweetheart... you in or you out?

471
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:50,828
You guys are all idiots!

472
00:21:56,747 --> 00:21:59,361
And so our Spring-Line Panties Party ended.

473
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,720
About five seconds after it started.

474
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:03,573
But, man, it was fun!

475
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:38,993
"Super Sub-Mom War: Training Stage"
