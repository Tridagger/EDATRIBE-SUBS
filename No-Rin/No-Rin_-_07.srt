1
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,428
Gah.

2
00:00:04,823 --> 00:00:06,658
Man, what is up with this heat?

3
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,535
Come on, look at the bright side, okay?

4
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,301
It could be freezing and we'd
have a bunch of dead vegetables.

5
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:12,660
Like our tomatoes and cukes.

6
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:14,843
Tomatoes and cukes don't do well in the cold?

7
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:17,627
Nope. Low temps mess with their growth and development.

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,868
It can cause them to bruise super easily.

9
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,081
Didn't know that.

10
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:22,863
Wow. That's awful.

11
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:25,144
Do soybeans do well in the heat?

12
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,677
Yeah. They'll be fine.

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,493
When you were planting them earlier,

14
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:31,212
I think I mentioned how incredibly useful soybeans are.

15
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:34,243
But what I didn't tell you is
that they have a special power.

16
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,195
They do?

17
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:38,222
Oh yeah. Hey Kousaku, why don't you tell her

18
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,160
about the three major nutrients in farming?

19
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,082
Sure.

20
00:00:41,535 --> 00:00:42,793
Well...

21
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,368
Nitrogen. Acid. And Potassium.

22
00:00:45,663 --> 00:00:47,822
Of the three, nitrogen is the most special.

23
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:51,985
It's true. Without it, crops won't grow properly.

24
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:52,699
Nitrogen.

25
00:00:52,758 --> 00:00:55,535
Yes. The mighty power of the super special soybean

26
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:57,479
lies in its ability to make large quantities

27
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,826
of the nitrogen nutrient.

28
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:00,092
Hmm...

29
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,423
There's a lot of the stuff just
floating around in the air.

30
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:05,418
Soybeans can convert it to usable compounds.

31
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:08,812
Or... To put it another way,
they make their own fertilizer.

32
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,451
Soy beans are... neato.

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,092
It's July. The hottest season is upon us.

34
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:17,951
Not to mention that our agricultural lives

35
00:01:17,976 --> 00:01:19,400
are heating up, too!

36
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,925
Alrighty then!

37
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:54,919
Here's to another hard day of work out in the fields!

38
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,493
Whoa. What's the deal with all this food?

39
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,493
Cucumbers, tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, bitter melon,

40
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:04,743
okra, pumpkin, zucchini, and corn!

41
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:07,243
We got bushels of reject vegetables!

42
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,783
So we dine for free!

43
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,576
It's "all you can eat," time, you guys!

44
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,662
Awesome.

45
00:03:11,703 --> 00:03:13,823
There are many valuable lessons for a farming student

46
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:16,676
to learn about life.
But the most important lesson of all

47
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:17,660
is this:

48
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:18,898
Is what?

49
00:03:19,493 --> 00:03:21,410
Students must always clean their plate!

50
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:22,525
No matter what!

51
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,765
Heck yeah. Think we've got you covered there!

52
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:25,179
Dig in!

53
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,234
Bon appétit!

54
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,689
What's wrong, Hata?

55
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:35,826
Minori cooked again, huh? This looks like her handiwork.

56
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:39,556
Uh-oh. It's reject veggie season again, isn't it?

57
00:03:40,076 --> 00:03:42,718
Last year's melon festival was a real mess, too.

58
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,243
Yeah! Those were the biggest melons I'd ever seen!

59
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,968
Surprise, surprise, Kousaku's blathering on

60
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:51,576
about useless nothings again!

61
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:53,799
So big!

62
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:55,537
The biggest I've ever seen!

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,176
Uh. You know, I actually sent you some nice,

64
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,951
juicy watermelons too, Ringo.

65
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,966
I made sure to pick out the sweetest ones!

66
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,243
Yeah. I know, thanks.

67
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,599
Sure. No prob!

68
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,130
Wait. You know?

69
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:12,455
Here we are again!

70
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,410
At the end of a hard day of work in the fields!

71
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,616
Well, I guess being stuck with too much food

72
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,701
is a first-world problem.
Things could be a lot worse, you know?

73
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:25,893
So true.

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,341
All the more reason we should savor every single bite!

75
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:30,994
Yeah! Thank you for the grub!

76
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,168
Wow! This cold bitter melon salad is delicious!

77
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:36,635
Oh, you like that? The secret ingredient

78
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,201
is a little chili oil in the sesame dressing!

79
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:42,618
What is this stuff?

80
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:43,804
Pear curry!

81
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:45,535
The crunchy texture and mild sweetness

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,765
give this dish the perfect one-two punch!

83
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:51,204
Wow, this ratatouille is richer

84
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,493
than a bunch of steamed veggies have any right to be!

85
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,889
I'll have seconds!

86
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,035
Eat up, everybody!

87
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,870
There's plenty more where that came from!

88
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:00,698
Huzzah!

89
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:01,785
Yum, yum.

90
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:02,638
Sweet!

91
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:10,251
Hey, what's the matter with you?

92
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,843
Kei. Do you think that we're getting fat?

93
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,083
I don't know.

94
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,260
Maybe we're just packing on muscle

95
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:17,676
from all that harvesting.

96
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,160
That's totally what it is!

97
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:21,785
I thought I was looking a little
more filled-out than usual.

98
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:23,660
But it's probably just my pythons!

99
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:26,480
Hey, you two! Great meal. Right?

100
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,285
I was wrong! We're all fat!

101
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,771
So long to being trim and fit! Say hello to obesity!

102
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,885
Yep. We're chunky.

103
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,964
You're awful!

104
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,368
You know that's the worst thing to say to a girl, right?

105
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Sorry if I offended you, maybe you'd prefer

106
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:48,260
I use a more politically correct term

107
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,258
like "pleasingly plump" or "fluffy?"

108
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:52,083
Here's the truth!

109
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:54,618
You two are fatties!

110
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:55,065
Huh?

111
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:06,418
He's right. You do look a little bit rotund.

112
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:09,157
Oh yeah, well, so do you. Fatty fat.

113
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,368
It's 'cause of those delicious meals you make every day!

114
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:13,728
Wait just a sec!

115
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,965
If you don't want what I'm cooking, then don't eat it!

116
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,731
Make me.

117
00:06:25,743 --> 00:06:28,093
Jack pot! A catfight, every young man's

118
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,455
"dream come true!"

119
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,160
Well, at the very least,
it's a good sumo-wrestling match.

120
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,915
You remember that time they mud-wrestled?

121
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:35,793
That was way cooler than this.

122
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,343
Seems they haven't learned how to properly use size

123
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,993
to their advantage in a hand-to-hand combat situation.

124
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,491
Agreed.

125
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,121
Lose weight! Right. Now!

126
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:54,678
We're skinny.

127
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,360
Exercise is the root of any good weight loss plan.

128
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,700
Lucky for us, we have plenty of
opportunities to exercise here!

129
00:07:04,326 --> 00:07:07,157
It's a good thing Miss Kinoshita's back to normal, too.

130
00:07:07,618 --> 00:07:09,468
Well, that's a former celeb for you.

131
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,470
Their freakish ability to suddenly drop weight

132
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:13,428
puts us to shame.

133
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,727
Honestly, I was worried about Minori the most.

134
00:07:15,752 --> 00:07:17,360
That so? And what worried you?

135
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,180
Oh, don't play dumb with me.

136
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,272
You forget this?

137
00:07:21,297 --> 00:07:21,785
Huh?

138
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,743
So, who was the last fatty standing, huh?

139
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:29,868
Tell me.

140
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,673
Tell me!

141
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:34,987
No one will marry me

142
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,188
'cause I look like a marshmallow!

143
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:38,868
What am I gonna do?!

144
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:40,618
You're wrong, guys won't want to marry you

145
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,541
'cause they'll assume you're already pregnant.

146
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,268
You're so mean!

147
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,580
Has your family seen it yet?

148
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:47,868
I wonder what they would think

149
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,326
if someone were to text them this?

150
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,368
No, please don't do that.

151
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:52,535
Oops. It already sent.

152
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:58,988
No! Jerk! You give that here! I'm not joking!

153
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:02,105
You monster! You demon! You nasty little ringworm!

154
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:03,118
Kousaku?

155
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:03,343
Oh?

156
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:03,583
Huh?

157
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,057
The soybeans.

158
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:10,218
There's something really wrong with them.

159
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:13,118
This fuzzy white stuff I've never
seen is growing near the root.

160
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:14,830
Huh. Mold, maybe?

161
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,510
If you give them too much water they can get moldy.

162
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,831
Especially when the weather's as hot as it's been.

163
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,368
But I've been watering them every day.

164
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:25,126
Ah. Oh. Yikes.

165
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,133
It's true. I even watered them when it rained.

166
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:31,799
Well. For future reference,
best to skip the stormy days.

167
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,295
But a little mold's not that big of a deal.

168
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:40,488
We'll take care of it.

169
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,798
Hey. Let's go take a look on our next break!

170
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:53,364
Let's see.

171
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,823
See it?

172
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,201
Whoa... No way!

173
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,466
Is it bad?

174
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:13,811
Ringo. Go get a teacher, please.

175
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,856
Hurry up.

176
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,421
Southern blight.

177
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,390
Wait, I don't get it.

178
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,901
What is "southern blight?" Will the plants be okay?

179
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:46,721
Southern blight is a terrible disease

180
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,734
that can sometimes develop in soil.

181
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,975
Crops hit by this disease don't survive.
They just fade away.

182
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:56,167
What's worse is that blight forms sclerotia

183
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,676
in the ground, allowing it to keep multiplying there.

184
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,048
What does that mean?

185
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,994
It means the disease contaminates the soil.

186
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,640
How can we fix it?

187
00:10:06,118 --> 00:10:07,517
Can't be fixed.

188
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,239
If any of the spores remain...

189
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,692
...then they'll infect next year's crop as well.

190
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:14,176
To prevent that, we have to throw out the soil,

191
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:16,260
and the crops, too. We burn them all.

192
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,410
That's awful.

193
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:24,697
This whole mess is pretty hard to believe, huh?

194
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,434
It sure is.

195
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,238
Southern blight turned up at another school recently.

196
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,633
Apparently, we both use the same dealer.

197
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:33,701
If only we'd heard about it earlier,

198
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:35,580
we might've been able to do something.

199
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:40,076
Maybe... But Kei...
you know this isn't your fault. At all.

200
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,662
Minori. How's Ringo?

201
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:46,006
Don't know, she said she wanted to be alone.

202
00:10:46,076 --> 00:10:46,879
No dinner?

203
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,910
She said she wasn't hungry, so I set some food aside.

204
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:50,868
Kousaku?

205
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:51,571
Huh?

206
00:10:51,993 --> 00:10:53,497
I think she needs your help.

207
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,826
Talk to her. I'm worried she's taking this on herself.

208
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,801
If she'll listen to anybody, it's you. Please.

209
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,466
I don't know.

210
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,974
Well, guess what?! I do!

211
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,247
Because that girl is...

212
00:11:07,973 --> 00:11:11,290
Just go talk to her, please. She needs you.

213
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,392
Ringo. It's me.

214
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:24,262
So look. Farming can be really fun.

215
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:27,825
It can be one of the greatest
gifts that life has to offer.

216
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,248
But... at the same time it can be really brutal.

217
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:34,451
That's why so many people quit,
'cause it's too difficult.

218
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:37,468
We work so hard for so little.

219
00:11:37,537 --> 00:11:39,715
It's not like we're gonna get rich doing this.

220
00:11:44,107 --> 00:11:46,273
Sometimes we don't even get paid.

221
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,328
Then why?

222
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:50,820
If the bad outweighs the good, then why do it at all?

223
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,444
Good question.

224
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,063
My answer is, "I don't know".

225
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,433
I guess I haven't figured that part out just yet.

226
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,163
How'd it go?

227
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,343
I'm not really sure.

228
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:04,423
Oh...

229
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,887
Well, it's like they say, "time is the best remedy."

230
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,064
Kousaku?

231
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:15,535
Hm? What's up?

232
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,410
I wanted her to plant those soy beans for a reason.

233
00:12:18,493 --> 00:12:20,031
It wasn't a random choice.

234
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:21,993
In the same way they enrich the soil

235
00:12:22,046 --> 00:12:23,700
and give life to new things,

236
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,374
I hoped those beans might help her.

237
00:12:27,135 --> 00:12:28,640
That her soul might be enriched.

238
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,150
And that she might also be born anew.

239
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:32,954
That's really thoughtful.

240
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,725
Yes, it's just that...
if she were to regret coming here,

241
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:37,325
I don't think I could stand it.

242
00:12:41,276 --> 00:12:41,983
Kei?

243
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,880
Yeah, what is it?

244
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:48,147
You're nice. And I'm lucky to have a friend like you.

245
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,196
Same here.

246
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:52,326
Oh yeah, this is good stuff!

247
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,285
A deep, forbidden friendship reveals its true nature

248
00:12:54,368 --> 00:12:55,785
in a secluded greenhouse!

249
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,063
We can call it...

250
00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:00,617
I'll even put out a fan book!

251
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,868
What?

252
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,510
If we sell one thousand of these bad boys

253
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,833
at five hundred a pop, we'll be filthy stinking rich.

254
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,368
Who wants to buy a yacht?

255
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:11,017
This isn't really in character for me, but I'm here.

256
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,089
I had a feeling my services might be needed

257
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,266
and looks like I was right.

258
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,410
Hello there, my darlings.
Did someone say forbidden love?

259
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,041
I heard that phrase and came as fast as I could!

260
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,720
Uh, what's going on?

261
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:24,363
Does somebody want to tell me
what you guys are doing here?

262
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,234
What are these for?

263
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:28,410
Duh. That's advance payment for the footage.

264
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:30,371
Miso and a mountain lily?

265
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,761
Wait, are these for Ringo?

266
00:13:32,993 --> 00:13:34,093
Uh. Yeah right!

267
00:13:34,118 --> 00:13:35,368
"Ringo?

268
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:37,176
Of course they're not for Ringo, why would they be?

269
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:38,826
It's not like we're too embarrassed to give it to her

270
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,926
directly or anything!"

271
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,956
Great! Now they know the truth, you idiotic woodsman!

272
00:13:44,535 --> 00:13:45,868
That was, by far, the weirdest thing

273
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,997
that's ever happened to me in my whole life.

274
00:13:48,314 --> 00:13:49,391
Kei?

275
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,196
I actually think Ringo will be just fine.

276
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:54,686
Don't you?

277
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:56,407
Yeah.

278
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,494
Kousaku. You're awake.

279
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:21,591
This is bad.

280
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,906
Yeah. Let's get Minori. Ringo too.

281
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:30,302
I called everybody I could think of.

282
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:31,785
This is everyone who showed.

283
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:34,076
What happened? What are we doing up?

284
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,868
We're here to pick some tomatoes.

285
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:37,149
But it's so late.

286
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,285
Let's just hope it's not too late.

287
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:39,993
Huh?

288
00:14:40,076 --> 00:14:40,899
Come on.

289
00:14:48,743 --> 00:14:50,663
Look.

290
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,285
They're splitting open.

291
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:55,118
It's been nothing but hot and dry outside.

292
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,701
All this time, these tomatoes have needed water.

293
00:14:58,663 --> 00:14:59,753
Now that it's raining.

294
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,595
The tomatoes will take in as much water as they can.

295
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:04,493
They'll split right open.

296
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,683
Where am I needed?!

297
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,588
Start with that row over there!

298
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:08,326
Right away!

299
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,401
Focus on the ones that haven't split yet!

300
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:11,575
Yes, sir!

301
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,910
We can still eat the bad ones.

302
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:39,785
We'll just puree them, or make them into jam, can them.

303
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,410
Keep on hustling, people!

304
00:15:41,435 --> 00:15:42,285
I don't get it.

305
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,311
Why does everyone seem okay with this?

306
00:15:45,451 --> 00:15:48,676
You raised them so carefully and waited so long for them to grow.

307
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,805
And now they're completely ruined.

308
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,406
I don't understand why you aren't more upset.

309
00:15:57,076 --> 00:15:58,649
Hey. You got a sec?

310
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,481
I like it out here.

311
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:13,273
Though you must really think
we're out in the sticks, huh?

312
00:16:14,427 --> 00:16:15,510
You know....

313
00:16:15,535 --> 00:16:17,923
I like it too, actually. So much nature...

314
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,305
I'm glad.

315
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,619
But... There's no natural nature.

316
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:26,118
Not in anything you see out here, anyway.

317
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:26,511
Hm?

318
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:30,864
The fields, the farms. The roads and the rivers.

319
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:32,859
People made them all, bit-by-bit

320
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,769
and generation-by-generation.

321
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,320
Our predecessors had it hard.

322
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,710
There was a time when nature was
cruel and unforgiving to them.

323
00:16:41,285 --> 00:16:42,560
And it's not just here.

324
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:47,128
Everywhere we humans live is the remains of
the great struggle between us and nature.

325
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:48,793
A battleground.

326
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,076
Battleground?

327
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,503
Yep.

328
00:16:50,668 --> 00:16:53,245
You know, there's a whole lot
that's hard about agriculture.

329
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,997
But at the end of the day,
it's more fun than anything else.

330
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,883
Just getting to watch your crops grow.

331
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,510
And the same goes for the people who made this.

332
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:01,995
It must have been joyful.

333
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,227
They pictured the kind of town this was going to become.

334
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,915
They dreamed about us, here in the distant future.

335
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,161
And with all that to look forward to, they worked hard.

336
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:12,818
And who knows?

337
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,080
Maybe our vegetables will inspire someone.

338
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,252
Maybe one day they'll do something great.

339
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,521
And maybe they'll make the world a better place

340
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:20,374
for us to live in.

341
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:22,276
But even if they don't...

342
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,428
Even if they decide to just keep on doing their best.

343
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:28,880
Well, I think that ties into the
future of the landscape, too.

344
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,513
You asked why I do this?

345
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:32,500
'Cause I think we can help people be better.

346
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,356
There's real power in what we do. That's why.

347
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:39,724
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,103
That story went off the rails pretty quick, didn't it?

349
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:43,240
It was you.

350
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:43,847
Huh?

351
00:17:43,872 --> 00:17:46,531
The veggies. You were the one who sent them to me.

352
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:47,144
Huh?

353
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:50,023
Back then, I was so exhausted with my life.

354
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:52,522
It was like I didn't even have the strength to eat.

355
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:55,135
Then someone on my staff made me a salad

356
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,967
out of vegetables a fan had sent me.

357
00:17:57,483 --> 00:17:59,193
Even though I was too tired to eat,

358
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:01,069
I figured I had to at least try it.

359
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,471
But when I put it in my mouth,

360
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:05,694
what happened next took me by surprise.

361
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,326
It tasted strange. Not like what I expected.

362
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,461
It tasted bad?

363
00:18:11,486 --> 00:18:15,593
No. Not bad. It was very earthy.
And tough in an odd way.

364
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:17,285
But somehow gentle and sweet.

365
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:18,785
Well, it wasn't that big of a deal,

366
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:20,965
I just wanted to send you some vegetables.

367
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,367
No. It was perfect.

368
00:18:23,993 --> 00:18:24,951
It really was.

369
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:26,660
You'd given me the taste of life.

370
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:29,092
You shared something I never experienced before.

371
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:30,618
It brought me to tears.

372
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,793
In that moment, I knew I'd be okay.

373
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:36,201
It was like someone was saying,
"If you trust this feeling,

374
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,620
and follow your heart, everything will be fine."

375
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,201
Don't you see?

376
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:48,555
You helped me. You helped me make my choice.

377
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,321
After that.

378
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,689
I happily ate every single
scrap of food you sent my way.

379
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,855
I looked forward to the letters that came with them too.

380
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,476
From the moment we started writing each other,

381
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,380
I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt

382
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,785
that I wanted to come here.

383
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:05,660
It was like I could taste how fun it was going to be.

384
00:19:05,735 --> 00:19:06,443
Wait a sec.

385
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:06,860
Huh?

386
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,490
I... I didn't send you any letters.

387
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:14,216
But... those vegetables were definitely you.

388
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,553
Yeah, but I didn't put my name on the box.

389
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,986
And no letters.

390
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:21,285
No, you... You signed them.

391
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,035
Those letters were definitely from you.

392
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:25,118
And there was a picture of everybody, too.

393
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,202
A picture?

394
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:32,175
This picture? With a letter from me?

395
00:19:42,622 --> 00:19:44,680
The tomato tragedy is over!

396
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,080
I'd say it's time we had ourselves some dinner!

397
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:48,149
Hm?

398
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:48,573
Huh?

399
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,885
Uh... You guys...?

400
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,910
Dinner's a good thing, so why do you look so stern?

401
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,009
Is everything alright?

402
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,451
There's something I'd like you to see, Minori.

403
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,112
Does this look familiar? You wrote it.

404
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,035
How could you do something like this, huh?!

405
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,410
Writing a bunch of fake letters to Ringo?!

406
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:09,176
I mean, to Yuka Kusakabe, pretending to be me!

407
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:10,451
I thought you'd be thrilled!

408
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:11,101
Huh?

409
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,785
I was only trying to help you keep

410
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,035
your super "creepazoid" factor down to a minimum.

411
00:20:15,118 --> 00:20:16,160
You should thank me!

412
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:21,070
But... Mm... Well. That's thoughtful.

413
00:20:21,326 --> 00:20:21,925
I guess...

414
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,627
Anonymously sending a girl you don't even know

415
00:20:23,652 --> 00:20:25,285
a bunch of vegetables for no good reason,

416
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,510
that's a one-way ticket to restraining order town!

417
00:20:27,535 --> 00:20:29,326
I think you're missing the point here!

418
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,368
Just think how Ringo must feel knowing all those letters

419
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,571
she read are actually from you and not from me!

420
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,899
Hmm... You've got a point.

421
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:38,491
Huh?

422
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:42,606
I am very sorry, Kinoshita. I hate that I mislead you.

423
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,034
I only wanted to help.

424
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:46,529
To paint a picture of what things are really like here.

425
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,595
But I see now that I was wrong.

426
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:52,661
Okay. Stand up.

427
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:58,672
I wanted to meet you.

428
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,343
This whole time... It was you...

429
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:05,618
Uh... Kinoshita?

430
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,980
All I ever wanted was to look
you in the eyes and talk to you.

431
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,826
About school, agriculture, all of it.

432
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,615
The way you did in your letters.

433
00:21:14,098 --> 00:21:16,598
I wanted it more than you could possibly know.

434
00:21:16,868 --> 00:21:18,631
So, you're not upset?

435
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:20,283
Of course not.

436
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,135
I pretended to be somebody else.

437
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,237
I lied to you.

438
00:21:23,423 --> 00:21:24,881
But what you wrote was true.

439
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,535
That counts for something, right?

440
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,533
And besides... If we're being real,

441
00:21:28,618 --> 00:21:30,750
it's not like I was entirely truthful either.

442
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:34,000
We're even. Truce? What do you say?

443
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:35,675
Yeah, sure.

444
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:38,563
I guess we're all kind of similar in some ways.

445
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:45,160
Hey. Can I call you "Minnopio?"

446
00:21:45,243 --> 00:21:46,037
Sure!

447
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:48,576
I don't mind that as long as I can call you "Ringotchi!"

448
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,578
I'd like that!

449
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:50,225
Awesome!

450
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:50,975
Minoppio.

451
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,353
I sure love you.

452
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,676
I like where this is headed. Kinoshita's happy again,

453
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,754
mysteries have been solved, and all's well.

454
00:21:57,955 --> 00:21:59,760
Looks like a fairy tale ending to me.

455
00:21:59,826 --> 00:22:01,955
Well, I think this is the worst!

456
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,934
Happily ever after, my ass!

457
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:38,189
Cooking Granny.
