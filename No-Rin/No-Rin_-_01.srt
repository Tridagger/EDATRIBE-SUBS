1
00:01:47,802 --> 00:01:50,636
Thank you! 
Thank you so very much!

2
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:55,677
You really know how to make a girl feel special!

3
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:59,761
Best audience ever-and I mean
that from the bottom of my heart!

4
00:01:59,844 --> 00:02:03,761
Yuka! Yuka! Yuka! Yuka!

5
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,761
I love you!

6
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,886
You're my queen!

7
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,272
Before the next set,

8
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:26,009
I want to introduce you to someone very special.

9
00:02:37,677 --> 00:02:41,886
This is the man all my songs are secretly dedicated to.

10
00:02:53,802 --> 00:02:55,052
I love--

11
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,317
I... love you...

12
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,151
Aw, man...

13
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,206
Really?

14
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:22,376
You're late 'cause you're not married to a pop star?

15
00:03:22,492 --> 00:03:25,117
Take a second to say those words aloud to yourself.

16
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:26,382
She has a point.

17
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,263
It's kind of sad.

18
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:30,471
Since we're on the subject of wet dreams,

19
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:34,323
when are you going to get a grip on
reality and stop fantasizing about Tokyo?

20
00:03:34,677 --> 00:03:36,344
Place will chew you up and spit you out.

21
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,636
Not if I'm a trendy farmer, it won't!

22
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,175
A trendy farmer?

23
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:52,309
Hah! Yeah, let me give you a clue there, slick.

24
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:54,687
Two weeks, you'll come crawling
back on your hands and knees.

25
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:58,148
Yokel like you'd be lucky winding up
married to the hometown harvest queen.

26
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,344
Oh, so now you have a crystal ball?

27
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,886
Yukatan and me will be together.

28
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,552
We'll grow rice in Harajukua,
then we're gonna-wait for it

29
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:08,188
take Ropongi by storm with cows!

30
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,628
You'll see!

31
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:13,844
Harvest queen will have to find someone else.
Besides, the only hometown girl my age is you.

32
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:14,526
Huh?!

33
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,686
Crazy coincidence, huh?

34
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:19,696
Funny how little details like that can skip your notice.

35
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,427
Kousaku, Minori. Please.

36
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:25,068
How 'bout you stop whatever this is and, you know, work?

37
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,581
Sorry. My bad.

38
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:27,957
Gee, thanks.

39
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,259
Way to get me on Kei's bad side today.

40
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,500
Hey! It takes two to tango!

41
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:35,296
Mad cow! Mad cow!

42
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:38,746
Actually, I think it's a bull!
Whatever! It's out and it's pissed!

43
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:40,927
We've got a teacher down!

44
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:41,977
Medic!

45
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:43,418
Matador!

46
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,687
They need better pens.

47
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,796
It was one of the peacocks last time, right?

48
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:49,185
Nah. It was the goat.

49
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:50,803
The peacock was the time before that.

50
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:55,619
Hey! Back to work! What's not our problem?

51
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:57,865
Runaway cattle.

52
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:58,789
Huh?

53
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:01,469
Um... Actually...

54
00:05:01,494 --> 00:05:02,121
Crap!

55
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,261
Whatever happens, we can't let it ruin the crop!

56
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,431
And how're we supposed to do that?

57
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:10,891
I'm on it, guys!

58
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:17,133
Dude! Kakizaki's insane! He's got this.
He made it to nationals!

59
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,944
No! Kakizaki--!

60
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:22,784
That thing is a monster!

61
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:24,618
Why do they keep it around?!

62
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:25,250
Whoa.

63
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:26,807
Kei!

64
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,587
Wha-What do we do?!

65
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:35,899
Just... take this and run like hell.

66
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:47,489
Aw, c'mon, give me some slack!
I got no beef with you!

67
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,392
Poor choice of words! Sorry! Don't kill me! Sorry!

68
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:00,265
Well, so far so good.

69
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,279
Oh, Wakadanna! It was just awful!

70
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,129
No one even cared I was almost trampled!

71
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:09,842
Kousaku.

72
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,250
You brought the career survey, right?

73
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:14,764
Yeah.

74
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,355
You made up your mind about college?

75
00:06:17,507 --> 00:06:19,382
Nah, still kind of on the fence about it.

76
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,396
Only thing I know for sure is I
want to specialize in agriculture.

77
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:25,895
Least that's a plan.

78
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,255
Look at me. Heh.

79
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:30,376
I'm just here 'cause my family's
been farmers since, like, forever.

80
00:06:30,886 --> 00:06:32,802
You telling me you got nothing lined up?

81
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:34,279
Well, there's Tokyo.

82
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:35,172
Ah...

83
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,858
Wait! Seriously?!

84
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,813
Yeah, why?

85
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,095
Ugh. Bumpkin...

86
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,450
You really think the "trendy
farmer" thing's going to take off?

87
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,885
As a matter of fact,
I already know where I'm going to start.

88
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:46,386
Ha!

89
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:49,344
A magical place called Furikoshi High School!

90
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,222
O-kay.

91
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,755
Just so I'm absolutely clear:

92
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:58,970
In dead earnest, you actually listed
"high school" as a career choice?

93
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,983
That's dumb. Like, really dumb.

94
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:02,390
Uh...

95
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,332
I'd appreciate it if you'd stop
talking to me like I'm an idiot!

96
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:06,731
Oh brother.

97
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,146
So, I guess it's safe to say you've
got it bad for this pop star chick?

98
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:13,594
Yukatan Kusakabe is not a "pop star
chick", she's a goddess!

99
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,636
And what exactly makes her a "goddess"?

100
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,762
Her dancing dinner-plate eyeballs!

101
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:19,603
Her delicate, duck-face mouth!

102
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:21,952
Those rosy apple cheeks!

103
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,151
That angelic voice from heaven!

104
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,802
Her long, naturally straight hair!

105
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,824
The way her eyebrows arch as if to say, "Who, me?"

106
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,094
Right. Thanks.

107
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,302
We get the picture.

108
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,719
Oh-ho, no you don't, my friend!

109
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:34,888
Not 'til you've heard me talk about
that one-of-kind, ice-melting smile--

110
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,847
Wrap it up, lover boy! No one here gives a crap!

111
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,686
The survey's about life after school.

112
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:40,636
Okay, fine.

113
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:41,886
What'd you put on yours, then?

114
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:42,486
Hmm?

115
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:47,411
College or job?

116
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:51,650
Uh! Ah! Um... Well, I guess all things considered,

117
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,644
Let's say, "job." Something in an office?

118
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:59,161
Hang on! Do-Don't read it!

119
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:04,185
If any of those things happen in an office,

120
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,274
you're doing them wrong.

121
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:07,520
This is dumb. Really dumb.

122
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,692
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot!

123
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,342
I'm thinking long term! Ugh!

124
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,043
Stop running your mouths.

125
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:15,720
Vulgarians!

126
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,746
It's Fun-bags McGee!

127
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,461
The name is Kochou!

128
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,791
Say it with me, now: Kochou Yoshida!

129
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:22,450
Got it?!

130
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,610
The plebes in Cultivation are a tragedy.

131
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:29,012
Small-minded guttersnipes, that's you.

132
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:32,722
Production Science is wasted on you.

133
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:36,938
Why they lump Cultivators and Animal
Husbandry students together, I'll never know.

134
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:39,095
I'm charged with the care of animate creatures.

135
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:41,055
You all just roll around in the dirt.

136
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,494
A-hem.

137
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:46,927
The students across the hall will thank
you to keep it down to a dull roar.

138
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:48,797
Your inane chatter is distracting.

139
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:51,844
Oh, Like your big, smelly cow
isn't putting us all off our game?

140
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,613
Silence, Vulgarian tramp!

141
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,167
You know nothing!

142
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,521
Sit down and be schooled!

143
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:03,726
This magnificent beast, Agehagou by name,
is a Hidaushi, the highest of the elite wagyu rank!

144
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,944
Which makes no real difference in her market value.

145
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:12,261
Actually, her fetching price is
expected to be stratospheric, plebe.

146
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:15,469
Give the magnificent beast room to breathe, people!

147
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:19,407
You can't just switch sides on a dime.
That's not how this works!

148
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:22,160
I pick the side that doesn't murder me!

149
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:25,562
Hmph. Violence in lieu of dialogue.

150
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:28,261
I must say, you sum up the Cultivators perfectly.

151
00:09:29,386 --> 00:09:30,358
Yoshida.

152
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,802
How dare you address me as though we were equals?!

153
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,465
We are worlds apart!

154
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,102
Cows are sort of on the skittish side, right?

155
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:43,486
They don't do all that great around people?
Not to tell you your job,

156
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:48,719
but do you think it's a smart idea to bring one into
a classroom full of loud, obnoxious "vulgarians?"

157
00:09:48,744 --> 00:09:51,074
Trying to hoist me by my own petard, eh?

158
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,109
Well, your attempt at a touché is as predictable as you!

159
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,393
Wow. Not cool.

160
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:58,594
Following this morning's debacle,

161
00:09:58,677 --> 00:10:02,033
I realized Agehagou's reaction
could create a teachable moment.

162
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,392
Call this an exercise in moron endurance.

163
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,261
Moron endurance?!

164
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:09,153
That actually makes sense.

165
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,637
Nice. Well done, Yoshida.

166
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,508
That's some cutting edge animal psychology technique.

167
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:15,927
Don't let anyone tell you different.

168
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:20,136
Well, so long as we're on the same page, I suppose.

169
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:24,219
So you understand why it's inappropriate
to confer with me on even terms.

170
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,170
Good! Cultivator Plebe!

171
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:31,562
Good morning, class!

172
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,177
Get a load of this spectacular weather we're having!

173
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,802
Not too hot, not too cold!

174
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,685
Makes a gal feel like Goldilocks at the wedding altar!

175
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,534
Miss!

176
00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:45,349
Yes, Ms. Nakazawa?

177
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:47,427
Points for calling me "Miss," by the way.

178
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:49,152
Teacher may not look forty,

179
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:51,719
but that doesn't mean she's not feeling her age.

180
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:57,170
Fun Bags-I mean- Yoshida brought a
big smelly cow into the classroom!

181
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,405
Huh. How about that.

182
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,001
I'm assuming you have a really
good explanation. Yoshida?

183
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:10,178
Yes, ma'am. You see,
Mr. Mutsu suffered an unfortunate accident.

184
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,052
I thought it best that I care for her while he recovers.

185
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,302
That's a complete one-eighty from what you said!

186
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,552
Hmm. And you think you're up to
the task of babysitting a cow?

187
00:11:18,622 --> 00:11:19,882
Oh, absolutely.

188
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,948
Hmph. You'd know better than me!

189
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:23,594
Aw, Miss Becky! C'mon!

190
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,344
This is totally ridiculous!

191
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,344
If she gets to bring a cow into the classroom,

192
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:30,011
then the rest of us should be
able to bring our planters, too!

193
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:32,011
Fair is fair! Who's with me on this?

194
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,136
Speak up, guys!

195
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,844
I'm with her! It's not right!

196
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,844
Why do the Animal Husbandry snobs
always get special treatment?

197
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:41,511
Because we don't make the school spend money
on stupid things like fertilizer trials!

198
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:44,511
But why don't you share some of that
produce you're always taste-testing, huh?!

199
00:11:44,594 --> 00:11:47,235
Everybody, stop arguing!

200
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,052
Now listen and listen good!

201
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,390
We're all in the same boat.

202
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,469
Focus on each other's positive traits!

203
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,802
But Ms. Becky!

204
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:55,569
It's really unfair that she gets to bring her cow!

205
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:58,048
What's unfair about observing the caste system?

206
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,302
Give me a tomato!

207
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,927
Sure! I'll throw one at you!

208
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,427
Ah-ha! All right.

209
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,317
Who wants to hear a tale of romance?

210
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:09,844
Your favorite teacher found herself in an upscale
five-star restaurant last night, sipping wine

211
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,219
across from the most intriguing man she'd ever met.

212
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,219
Rich, sophisticated, handsome.

213
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,011
Hanging on every teensy little word she had to say.

214
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:20,969
A man a woman would love not to have to
make-up out of soul-crushing loneliness.

215
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:25,552
That's right, boys and girls.

216
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:28,948
Yours truly was on a date with an empty seat.

217
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:34,775
Okay, then! What do you say we get started?

218
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,775
Down the hatch!

219
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,110
Ahhhh...! Seconds please!

220
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:53,320
Good, right?

221
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,207
Alrighty then, coming right up!

222
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,976
Thanks for the grub!

223
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,408
Man, that was good!

224
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:11,052
Tempers flared today in the House of Councilors
over the Prime Minister's proposed tax increase.

225
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,876
Members of the opposing party
accuse the Minister's cabinet--

226
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,884
Why are human beings hard-wired to
care about taste when it comes to food?

227
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,302
I mean, it's a blatant design
flaw when you think about it:

228
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:20,427
we want flavor.

229
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:21,840
Nutrition? Meh.

230
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,221
We eat what tastes good.

231
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,150
If we're lucky, it's also good for us.

232
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:27,905
Why would God make us that way? Is he even real?

233
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:30,796
Blasphemy! Of course he's real!

234
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:35,281
He just put all of his genius into creating Yukatan!

235
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:40,815
Kousaku. She is living proof that God
loves us all and wants us to be happy!

236
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,692
Kousaku.

237
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:45,844
Any guy who doesn't grovel at Yukatan's
feet isn't worthy to call himself a man!

238
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:47,552
Earth to Kousaku! Come in!

239
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:48,921
Damn it, what do you want?!

240
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:50,444
Can't you see I'm deep in meditation?

241
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:52,796
You seriously need to look at the television.

242
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,660
Yeah, it's a pretty big deal.

243
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,484
What?

244
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,652
Like anything's a bigger deal than my Yuka--

245
00:13:57,677 --> 00:13:59,480
Excuse me! Is it true you're retiring?

246
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,680
God is dead!

247
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:09,170
It's not true! I refuse to accept it!

248
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:11,320
No, no, no, no, no!

249
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,581
It's all a vicious lie!

250
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,765
Will you come out of there already?

251
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,427
We're going to be late for class.

252
00:14:28,844 --> 00:14:30,244
Life marches on, dude.

253
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,373
Fine. I shouldn't have to do this, but...

254
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,103
Time to come out and face reality!

255
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,344
Why do you have to be such a pain?

256
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:43,423
Everybody gets--

257
00:14:47,614 --> 00:14:49,261
What's wrong with you?!

258
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:53,981
Can't believe people actually buy those...

259
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:56,531
You're kidding me.

260
00:14:56,556 --> 00:14:59,497
And here I'd been thinking you
were a semi-normal human being.

261
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:03,987
You do realize this means we have no choice but
to take you out back and put you down, right?

262
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,047
At least tell me you're wearing a shirt under there.

263
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,561
No, I am not wearing a shirt!

264
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,076
Yukatan and I are of one flesh!

265
00:15:12,101 --> 00:15:13,466
Textbook PTSD.

266
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:18,719
He's like that guy who can't wash the sheets after
his girlfriend puts the kibosh on their relationship.

267
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,353
It might be too late for him.

268
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,293
Hey!

269
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,793
Stop being a freak for two seconds
and come back to the real world!

270
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,621
If you don't come to class, you'll fail.

271
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,203
Nobody wants that.

272
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:36,060
How else you going to be a "trendy farmer?"

273
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,136
What'd be the point?

274
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:39,469
Excuse me?

275
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,219
I only ever grew stuff

276
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,511
so I could send fresh vegetables to Yukatan.

277
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:48,677
Kibo 209 to Osaka boarding
on Platform Sixteen.

278
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,886
Kibo 209 to Osaka...

279
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,826
Let me make sure I get this:

280
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:53,469
You send it all to her?

281
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,552
Everything you've grown in class since forever
goes to feed a well-off Japanese pop star?

282
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:58,025
Yup.

283
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,568
Eggplants in particular, though. Big, bulging eggplants.

284
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:02,969
Pretty sure that's harassment.

285
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:05,011
Congratulations, you're a stalker.

286
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,840
What are you talking about?!

287
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:10,594
If you were a girl, how would you feel about some
complete and total stranger shipping you a box

288
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,219
of produce shaped like that?

289
00:16:12,302 --> 00:16:14,876
But... she lives in Tokyo!
It's a concrete jungle over there!

290
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,629
It's impossible to find good veggies.

291
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,594
C'mon, who cares what it's shaped like?

292
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,564
It's fresh!

293
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:21,671
Listen.

294
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,302
I know in your mind this is all completely innocent.

295
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:28,207
Thanks. Knew you'd get it.
That's why you and me are bros.

296
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,260
You ever send this girl anything else?

297
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:32,152
Loads of big, warty cucumbers.

298
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,785
Vice Squad! Book this pervert, now!

299
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,652
I just said we're bros!

300
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:36,969
Come on, Minori!

301
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,777
We've got to wash our hands of this creep-a-zoid.

302
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:40,029
Guilt by association!

303
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:41,779
Wait! I sent a bunch of other stuff, too!

304
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:43,261
Sweet corn, bitter gourds,

305
00:16:43,286 --> 00:16:45,236
some mushrooms from the forestry department!

306
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:47,302
Next shipment's going to have some daikon in there!

307
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:48,136
I try to give a little

308
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:48,817
Shut up!

309
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,441
I don't want to be an accessory!

310
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,423
You're so pathetic...

311
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,466
You really see nothing wrong with this, huh?

312
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,331
There isn't!

313
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:58,119
I'm just trying to do something
nice for someone special!

314
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,121
Uhh... It's creepy.

315
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,258
All right, that does it!

316
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:04,133
School me. Now.

317
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,921
Explain to me exactly what it is I'm doing wrong here.

318
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,871
Go on. I'm all ears.

319
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:09,840
Give me a break.

320
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,088
You need to be told why it's creepy?

321
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,421
Apparently, yeah.

322
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:17,694
What about sending something made with love to someone
who means the world to you is such a huge crime?

323
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:21,356
Uh, you don't think eggplants
might've been a little too suggestive?

324
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,052
Fine. Never mind the eggplants.

325
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:28,094
The real issue is you mailing them
anonymously to someone you've never even met.

326
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,610
Yeah.

327
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:29,802
No. Nuh-uh.

328
00:17:29,827 --> 00:17:30,969
Don't skip over the eggplant thing.

329
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,788
You're the one who made it the hot button.

330
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:36,277
Put yourself in my shoes: your best friends
rag on your produce-I mean, come on,

331
00:17:36,302 --> 00:17:37,841
you wouldn't need an explanation?!

332
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:39,798
No one's ragging on your produce.

333
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,955
It's just, eggplants are... shaped funny...

334
00:17:43,475 --> 00:17:46,136
Oh, I see. So eggplants are shaped funny.

335
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,367
Funny as in: dirty. Uh-huh.

336
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,344
Remind you of something, maybe?

337
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,761
Seems like a personal problem if you ask me.

338
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:54,125
Hey. It's not--

339
00:17:54,386 --> 00:17:56,024
Look, I don't make the rules, okay?

340
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:02,847
And what rules are those?
You'll have to spell them out for me.

341
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:06,397
Describe for me what the eggplant looks
like so I'll know for future reference.

342
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:10,012
C'mon. It's clearly important--
What're they shaped like?

343
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:10,885
Huh?

344
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:15,559
Uh... They're-They're shaped like a...

345
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,094
...pen...

346
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:20,698
Stop trying to make me sound like a pervert!

347
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,851
Nice one.

348
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,710
You have to admit you had that coming.

349
00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:28,275
Yeah. Guess it's kind of hard to argue with
the logic of that from this perspective.

350
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:30,903
Whatever.

351
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,620
She probably doesn't even open the box you mail them in.

352
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,875
You ever gotten a response from this girl?

353
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:46,852
Never have, never will...

354
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:48,180
Don't be so dramatic.

355
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,900
You're bound to get something from her.

356
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:50,873
Eventually.

357
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:52,373
I've stayed anonymous.

358
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:54,768
There is officially no hope for you.

359
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,576
Makes it that much creepier.

360
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:58,178
It doesn't matter.

361
00:18:58,268 --> 00:19:00,810
Just 'cause her career is over
doesn't mean you get to skip class.

362
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:01,552
Here!

363
00:19:01,652 --> 00:19:03,277
Get off your rump and make an effort!

364
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,844
We're all in this together!

365
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,135
Pass! Life as I know it is over!

366
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,296
From now on if you want me...

367
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,756
You'll have to talk to Yuka-tan!

368
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:15,331
Oh, she's so beautiful! She's so sweet! So perfect!

369
00:19:19,136 --> 00:19:20,594
Ugh. Fine.

370
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,699
The real one's probably a total bitch anyway.

371
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:23,446
Blasphemer!

372
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:26,287
Just because no man in his right
mind would give you his eggplant

373
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:28,344
doesn't mean you get to foul-mouth my true love--

374
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:31,886
Goodbye, future offspring...

375
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,011
I am not going to say this again!

376
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:37,219
Stop being a titty baby and grow a pair!

377
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,527
Our grades are on the line and
if you don't get it in gear,

378
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:43,606
I'll give the holier-than-thou's in Animal Husbandry
free reign to mangle your shriveled ball sack!

379
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,390
Now do we have an understanding,

380
00:19:45,415 --> 00:19:47,341
or do I need to drill you a little more?

381
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:48,194
Got it...

382
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:07,719
Why are we doing this?!

383
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,073
There's no point!

384
00:20:09,098 --> 00:20:12,223
Stop bitching! Nobody cares what you think.

385
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:15,101
Kei, make him focus on his work!

386
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,281
Huh? Right.

387
00:20:19,873 --> 00:20:22,395
So last night was a complete wash!

388
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,415
Literally!

389
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,612
I bought this fabulously expensive essential oil

390
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:27,094
I read about online everyone says

391
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,719
makes you look ten years younger.

392
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:30,426
Talk about incredible!

393
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:34,316
Oh, my skin was so soft,
you'd think I just popped out of the womb!

394
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:36,844
Then I thought, "why spend so much," right?

395
00:20:36,957 --> 00:20:40,356
What's so 'essential' about essential
oils that any old oil won't do?

396
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:43,411
So, it's into the kitchen for
a bottle extra virgin olive oil

397
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,094
with a sprinkle of chili powder,

398
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,219
'cause, you know, in for a penny, in for a pound.

399
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:50,094
And let met tell you boys and girls, it made me slick.

400
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,136
As in, like a fish. A fish!

401
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,386
So out comes the smart phone,

402
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:54,886
'cause we all know I'm a bit of an over-sharer.

403
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,386
Selfie after selfie posted on the web.

404
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:58,616
Good times!

405
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,927
Kind of pathetic actually.

406
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,713
A grown woman dousing herself in olive oil to try

407
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:07,201
and grab a little attention from the opposite sex.

408
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:10,552
That, class, is what adults call "desperation."

409
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,589
You might think you understand the
meaning of the word, trust me, you don't.

410
00:21:17,301 --> 00:21:18,094
Oh. Right.

411
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,347
You have a new classmate.

412
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:21,177
It's not a cow, is it?

413
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:23,351
No. In fact, she's anything but.

414
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:26,219
Hey. Miss Kinoshita. Come on in!

415
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:45,301
No way this girl's an ordinary high school student.

416
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:47,779
She's too pretty. I mean, look at her.

417
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:51,303
She makes that uniform look like
something out of a magazine.

418
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:53,208
She looks like a pop star.

419
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:54,342
She looks like...

420
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,497
My Yukatan.

421
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:00,237
My name's Ringo Kinoshita.

422
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:04,712
Eh?

423
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:38,320
"The King of Farmers."
