1
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,083
Come on, damn it!

2
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:34,333
Open!

3
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,125
This is a nightmare.

4
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,375
I've had better days.

5
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,958
Crazy bitch is trying
to kill us, isn't she?!

6
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,541
Speaking optimistically
I'd say we've got half an hour

7
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,541
until this place is filled
to the rafters with gas.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,541
So yes, she's trying to kill us.

9
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,083
Dinner time, love.

10
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,291
Wakey wakey.

11
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:17,166
I made your favorite; beef
stew with extra carrots, yummy.

12
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,500
My man needs his strength.

13
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,625
Come on, ah.

14
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:29,875
♪ opening song ♪

15
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,291
Goddamn it!

16
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:14,666
This is bullshit!

17
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,000
We just stand here and croak?!

18
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,166
Well I'm not going to go
quietly, I can tell you that!

19
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,041
Keep your shirt on, my friend.

20
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,833
Believe it or not,
as bad as things look,

21
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,208
I don't think we're
out of options.

22
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,375
Knock it off you're going to

23
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,833
break every tooth in
the guy's mouth!

24
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:47,958
What?

25
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,875
That's hurting him!

26
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,208
How can you be
so freaking clueless?!

27
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,375
You're supposed to be his girl!

28
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,666
Supposed nothing.

29
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,625
I am.

30
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,583
Tell her, darling.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,708
I know it's intense,
but this is home for a while.

32
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,500
We're safe from the
cops here and the other

33
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,916
Diary Users can't
get to us, either.

34
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,500
This is the only way to
reach our happy ending.

35
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,958
I'm all ears, Nancy Drew.

36
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,458
You got a plan?

37
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,625
I suggest we wait a
little longer before you

38
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,666
start blogging your last
will and testament.

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,541
There's a lot going on here.

40
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:24,416
Might as well give
things a closer look.

41
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
Time for pee-pees.

42
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,375
Uh-uh!

43
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,875
You're nuts if you think
I'm going to watch this!

44
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:42,916
Alrighty.

45
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,125
Here goes, off with the undies.

46
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,916
Don't you do it!

47
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,750
Testing, testing.

48
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:50,666
1 2 3.

49
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,416
Afraid the gig is up.

50
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:00,708
Before you cut me off,
answer me this.

51
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:04,458
Having tea with a pair of
skulls up there, per chance?

52
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,041
Excuse me?

53
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,458
You should know
me better than that.

54
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,208
You think I've been
collecting moss since you

55
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,166
two appeared to slip the
surly bonds of Earth?

56
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,250
I went to your house.

57
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,500
Thought it would
be a good idea to

58
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
take a second look at that pit.

59
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,541
Good thing...

60
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,458
Cause this go round I hit
pay dirt, so to speak.

61
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:21,958
Bodies.

62
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,666
Funny thing, though.

63
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,125
There were three of them;
two with heads missing.

64
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,541
Hewn like firewood.

65
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,250
Quite recently.

66
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,666
Now you tell me if it's all that
big of a stretch to assume

67
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,708
you're toting them
around like tchotchkes.

68
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,458
You woke them up!

69
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,083
My parents were sleeping
and you woke them up!

70
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,666
I am many things, but not
disrespectful of the dead;

71
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,708
I didn't just leave them
exposed to the elements.

72
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:45,375
You put them back
where you found them?

73
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,833
Cut the chit chat and
get on with it already!

74
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,000
Relax...

75
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,583
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of things.

76
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,458
There's still something
about this that doesn't fit,

77
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,458
not matter how I slice it.

78
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,916
Help a guy out
on this one, Yuno.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,750
We've got three corpses
laid to rest in your backyard.

80
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:05,916
Two sans craniums;
one fully intact.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,166
Let's assume two are
your parents, as you say.

82
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,250
Fine.

83
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,708
Who's contestant number three?

84
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,541
You do know, right?

85
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,625
Tell you what, leave it for now.

86
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,625
Let's negotiate.

87
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,041
You're all dead.

88
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,458
Unless you're cool
with me keying

89
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,000
the fuzz in to your
backyard spa.

90
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,708
You'll nix the gas
and let us out of here.

91
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,333
I mean, mommy and daddy's
corpses taking a dirt nap while

92
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,750
you play house
with their skulls,

93
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,791
you want that on the DL, right?

94
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,916
If you're trying to tick
her off, I think it worked.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,041
Nice, dude.

96
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,125
Now she's going to
ignore us as we die.

97
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,750
I'm at full bars.

98
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,291
Better give me an answer.

99
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,250
You're so random.

100
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,875
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,708
I'm happy to repeat what's at
stake if you need clarification.

102
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,416
At stake?

103
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,833
Hey, pookie.
Uh...

104
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,291
Your buddies are kind
of weirding me out.

105
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,083
Radio silence, people.

106
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,500
Wait!
No, no, no, no!

107
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,958
I...

108
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,541
Fantastic.

109
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,666
Quite a selective memory.

110
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,291
Rather literally in
this case, I'm afraid.

111
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,208
Aw shit!

112
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,291
What'd she do?!

113
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,791
The gas is coming
out full throttle!

114
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:40,666
You crazy bitch!

115
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,416
I swear to god.

116
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,708
Snap out of it... Talk
some sense into this nut!

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,250
This isn't...

118
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm not one of these people;
this isn't how I should go!

119
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,625
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

120
00:07:57,416 --> 00:08:00,416
I'm going to die!

121
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,791
Screw this.

122
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,250
I'm posting my will!

123
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,708
Don't try to sell me anymore
of your optimism bullshit!

124
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:10,166
There's always a workaround.

125
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,000
Always.

126
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,541
What the hell is this?

127
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,041
Came out of left field.

128
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:36,500
My phone has apparently
just become one of those, uh...

129
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:42,250
"Welcome, apprentice." Is this
somebody's idea of a joke?

130
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,083
Okay, according to this I'm
an apprentice diary user!

131
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,333
Come again?

132
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,000
Look!
I'm not yanking ya!

133
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,541
My phone totally
tells the future now!

134
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,000
Anybody else here think
this is totally surreal?

135
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,833
You're going to hoist
me on your shoulders

136
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,458
so I can get out
through the vent!

137
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,541
Umm.

138
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,166
What's a Kousaka Kick?

139
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,750
"I rock?"

140
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,958
This is crazy.

141
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,041
Well it's a better
plan than mine was.

142
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,333
I say go for it.

143
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,208
What've we got to lose?

144
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,500
Wait, what?

145
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,958
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

146
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,250
What is that?

147
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,958
Coming loose?

148
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:47,750
Give me a second.
I'm not James Bond.

149
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,458
I take that back.

150
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:53,916
I'm awesome.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,375
Part one, done.

152
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,083
Here, take this it's heavy.

153
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,458
Gotcha.

154
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,583
Alright, 007... Recap.

155
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,125
Find your way to the
surveillance room,

156
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,125
Yuno's bound to
have Yuki there with her.

157
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,583
All over it.

158
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,875
Wait a sec.

159
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,583
There's another
diary user nearby.

160
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,916
Kousaka...

161
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,041
Kick!

162
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:40,791
Yo!

163
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,458
Take notes, people.

164
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,750
That is how you
make an entrance!

165
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,291
And what do we have here?

166
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,541
Ugh!

167
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,250
Seriously, what do you
have against clothes?!

168
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,000
Over here!

169
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,041
Whoa, dude!

170
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,083
Psycho twat managed
to catch you?

171
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,625
Tell me...

172
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,291
Have we met?

173
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,041
Don't even try to
stand there and act

174
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,041
like you don't remember
me, sweet cheeks.

175
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:06,041
I'm twelve distinct
kinds of badass.

176
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,666
Take it in, ladies.

177
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,416
What's your name?

178
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,083
Did someone hit
you on the head?!

179
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,166
Kousaka?

180
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,916
Hinata.

181
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,375
What's with my voice?

182
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,625
Oh no...

183
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,666
All I wanted was to look
at the stars with her.

184
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,083
She drugged me.

185
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,416
She had to have.

186
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,666
I'm sorry, sweet pea;
I know it's not very pleasant.

187
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,583
I have to do what I can
to protect us till July 28th.

188
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,875
I tried to get away, didn't I?

189
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,416
I'd have done something if

190
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,791
there'd ever been the
opportunity, but...

191
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,291
Slumber party's over, babe.

192
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,750
Cash it in.

193
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,000
My phone now gives me the

194
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,833
pertinent skinny about
what's going to happen.

195
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,791
Like, in what ways
I'll be amazing.

196
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,291
Are you trying to tell me
you're one of the diary users?

197
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,041
How did Kousaka get
his hands on a diary?

198
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,166
So, it's a safe bet
you're here to eliminate us.

199
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,458
I'm here to save his dumb ass.

200
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,541
How are you going to do that?

201
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,291
Think I'll keep the specifics to
myself, but I'm getting him

202
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,541
and Hinata out of here
whether you like it or not.

203
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,916
It says so.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,666
And I got to say, it's
pretty awesome when all you

205
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,666
need to be the hero is
a list of instructions, right?

206
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:03,583
Uh-uh!

207
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,083
Don't pass out on me!

208
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,875
Don't you worry.

209
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,333
You'd better be
rocking it, Kousaka.

210
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,500
There's an easier way.

211
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,583
Back off and I'll take them out

212
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,375
of here without
kicking your ass.

213
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,541
Less you want to go mano a mano
with the Kousaka King Diary!

214
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,916
Fine...
I give up.

215
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,375
Your majesty needs the keys
to his kingdom, I assume?

216
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,958
Do what?

217
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,375
One of them
unlocks Yuki's shackles.

218
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,000
The other unlocks the control
console, which, by the way,

219
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,083
you'll need if your friends
want out of the gas chamber.

220
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,958
I'm going to toss the
one that controls

221
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,750
the console over to you okay?

222
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,750
And the one for your boyfriend?

223
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,125
It'll sit right there
for the moment.

224
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:48,875
Insurance while I retrieve dear
old mom and dad, you understand.

225
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,958
If that's not cool,
it's time to speak up.

226
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,333
Otherwise let's do
this nice and easy.

227
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,833
I'd focus on getting my
teammates some fresh air;

228
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,000
the boy can be worried about
once they're in the clear.

229
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,083
It's got to be a trap.

230
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,875
She'd never just
give in like this.

231
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,125
Everything checks out on here.

232
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,666
We have got ourselves a deal.

233
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,500
Break a leg.

234
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:18,291
Whatever.

235
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,833
She's stalling for
time... has to be!

236
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,041
Oh no!

237
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,583
Don't do it!
She's tricking you!

238
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,375
He's never going
to make it to that key.

239
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:36,458
And score!

240
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,166
Wake up, Kousaka!

241
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,041
She's going to kill you!

242
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,000
Boyah! The door's
unlocked! You're welcome.

243
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,750
That's music to my ears!

244
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,166
Now commencing
hero deal part deux!

245
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:01,375
Don't stand
there like an idiot!

246
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,791
Run!!!!

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,625
I, I have to do something!

248
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,375
Did, you...

249
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,416
...just hear Kousaka scream
or am I hallucinating?

250
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,333
We should get moving.

251
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,125
But, this wasn't...

252
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:38,208
How do you suppose
Diary Users fight if they

253
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,625
all have a window
into the future?

254
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,791
Look, I'm begging you
not to kill me, please!

255
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,041
A diary that only tells you
when you've won is a liability.

256
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,916
It's funny, though,
you're a perfect match,

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,458
you're both so obsessed with
badass-ness there's no thought

258
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,791
for the times when
you fall a bit short.

259
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,791
Well, what's taking you so long.

260
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,458
Free him like your diary says.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,833
Just be prepared to die
after you've finished the job.

262
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,041
C'mon...
Time's a wasting.

263
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,041
Ugh...
Now what?

264
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,375
Yuki...?
What're you?

265
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:27,666
You didn't just do, that...
Darling, why?

266
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,500
You and your diary are matched
just as well, sweetheart.

267
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,250
So deal with it.

268
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,333
You're both so fixated on me,
your periphery is shot.

269
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,625
Hinata kicked me the key.

270
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,041
Simple as that.

271
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:50,083
Three diary users en route.

272
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,583
Not good.

273
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,250
Yuki!
You're alive!

274
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,875
Hinata?!

275
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,375
Please don't!

276
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,166
What are you waiting
for, short round?

277
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,333
Come on!

278
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:18,333
Let's get out here!

279
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,625
Right.

280
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,666
Sweet pea.

281
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,250
You can't just leave.

282
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,000
If we don't stick together what
chance do we have of making it?

283
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,291
I need you.

284
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,458
Remember?

285
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:28,916
And it goes without
saying you need me.

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,625
Think of what's out there.

287
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,500
We're sitting ducks if we
don't do this as a team!

288
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:35,500
--Yuki...
--Tune her out.

289
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,750
Hey...

290
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,916
You were going to show
me some stars, mister,

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,875
don't think I've forgotten that!

292
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,291
Screw you.

293
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,666
Yuki.

294
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,083
Excuse me, Matron.

295
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,916
Apparently, Kousaka Ouji's diary
has honed in on two other users.

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,583
No word yet on who.

297
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,083
I see.

298
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,958
I hope you don't mind, but
I took the liberty of sending in

299
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,791
three of your top
apprentices to help keep

300
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,375
the situation on the
right side of interesting.

301
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,875
Well that should take
care of that, shouldn't it?

302
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,500
Right now, ma'am, Kousaka
is locking horns with Yuno Gasai

303
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,916
but it doesn't look
as though the fight's

304
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,166
going to pan out in his favor.

305
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,125
What have I said about
being a brute, Takeshi?

306
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,666
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,791
Orin, dear.

308
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,541
Yes, ma'am?

309
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,958
I'm thinking miso and
boiled radishes tonight.

310
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,916
Yeah!

311
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:09,333
Hey.

312
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,208
Talk to me, Yuki.
How you doing back there?

313
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,541
Fine.

314
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,875
Yeah, well that's sure
as hell not how I'm doing.

315
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,833
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:20,208
Stop it; there's no
reason for you to apologize.

317
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,916
She's a nutcase.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,250
And I hate to say it,

319
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,708
but you'll need to be
prepared to see her again.

320
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,625
So that was them just now.

321
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,416
Think we should turn around
and get this over with?

322
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,083
Hell no, right?

323
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What was that all about?

324
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,791
Friends of yours?

325
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,958
You need me whether you
acknowledge it or not,

326
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,083
you misguided bastard.

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,791
Because they're coming.

328
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,166
Oh yes; they're coming.

329
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:26,833
♪ closing song ♪

330
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:04,666
Ah, nothing like a quick
morning dip to get the old--

331
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,708
Holy shit!

332
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,625
There's a dead
midget in the pool!

333
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,833
It's alive, whatever it is.

334
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,333
Kind, brave sir!

335
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,958
That disarmingly shrill outburst
saved me from the clutches

336
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,708
of death for without
it I would've slept

337
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,916
so long I'd have
needed gills to survive!

338
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,833
Oh.

339
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,250
Okay.

340
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,333
Should you be out here
without your parents?

341
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,916
Never mind that, oh gallant one.

342
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,583
In exchange for
your heroism I am

343
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:30,208
bound to grant you
a single wish.

344
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,375
Your voice is so weird,
it's like you're a kid, but not.

345
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,125
Wish, please.

346
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,291
Oh...
Well...

347
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:38,875
Let's see here.

348
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,125
I can't do anything about
your face, so don't ask.

349
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,375
Hey!

350
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:43,875
For the record I like
my face just how it is!

351
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,125
Whatever.

352
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:47,166
C'mon, tell me what you
want so we can do this.

353
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,166
Uh...

354
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,833
You're putting me on the spot.

355
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,041
Just ask for what
everyone does...

356
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,166
...the ability to see
into the future.

357
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,583
Are you serious?!

358
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,291
Wait a second; did you
give Yuki his phone?!

359
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,416
I played a very important
part in how he got it.

360
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Awesome!

361
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,625
I want the same
provider he has, then!

362
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,541
Very well.

363
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,708
But before I grant this wish,
you must agree to

364
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:10,041
undergo a daunting trial
as a test of character!

365
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,625
Eh...

366
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,000
It's not all that far down;
don't even think about it.

367
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,125
You want me to do a swan dive.

368
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,708
Umm.
Hold up.

369
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,875
That'd completely splatter
me from this height.

370
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:22,916
Ah!

371
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,291
Look who's beginning to spy into

372
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,500
the future like an old
pro wearing a hat.

373
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,166
No kidding?

374
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,083
Like I said, don't even
think about it, just jump!

375
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,541
I'm telling you, if I dive
from up here it'll squish me.

376
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,125
It's the law of
equivalent exchange;

377
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,791
acquisition takes sacrifice!

378
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,333
How is it fair that
I have to die just to

379
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,041
get a peek into the
freaking future?!

380
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,541
Wow, you're either a
cheapskate or a wuss.

381
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,666
Stop whining and do it!

382
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,625
I don't think so!

383
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:50,541
That was out!

384
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,291
That was a Mulligan!

385
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,958
I get another shot!

386
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:54,541
Wow...
Respect, man.

387
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,666
Any longer under water and you'd
have needed gills to survive.

388
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,791
I was worried.

389
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:58,750
That was a...

390
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,208
Hey, is this your phone?

391
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,291
Dream?
