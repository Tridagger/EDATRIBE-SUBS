1
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,000
Attention all units the
hospital has been

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,750
seized by three
apparent terrorists.

3
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,875
Assume the premises to be
heavily rigged with IED's.

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:40,458
That means seal it off people.

5
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:43,958
Swat team's just
off the truck, chief.

6
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,166
Tell them to get their
asses in there, STAT.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,125
Uh, there's still quite
a few patients left inside.

8
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,416
I mean... your son.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,208
Get the team in position.

10
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,916
Right away, sir.

11
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,125
Damn you.

12
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:08,875
♪ opening song ♪

13
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:45,791
Don't worry, hon.

14
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,625
You're too important to kill.

15
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,833
Where do my options
go if you're dead?

16
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,541
We're going to bait hubby
off the chess board, though.

17
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,125
Nice way of saying, kill him.

18
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,666
The ethics bothering you?

19
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,500
As long as my
Yuki gets out of this,

20
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,791
I don't give a damn
about the ethics.

21
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,458
I'm starting to think
I short-changed her,

22
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,958
calling her a stalker.

23
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,416
I mean, she's on her
own planet, yeah,

24
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,125
but hell the girl's committed.

25
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,083
And cute.

26
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:16,916
Alright.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,125
Here's the deal.

28
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,291
I nominate myself to
spearhead negotiations.

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:23,000
Yuno, guard the hostages
and monitor your boy.

30
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,541
Yuki, take the perimeter.

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:25,750
The hell does that mean?!

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:26,833
What do I do?

33
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,666
You grow a pair.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,166
Make a choice you
want left pocket or right?

35
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:34,416
Oh uh, the right.

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,333
Congrats.

37
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,250
You win a grenade.

38
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,958
Holy crap.

39
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,541
When you're ready to
use it, take out the pin,

40
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,708
throw, and take cover.

41
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,250
You'll have five seconds.

42
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,416
Aw what's wrong,
are you nervous?

43
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:49,250
Hey, sweetie?

44
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,916
You're low on ammo, right?

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,458
Take these with you.

46
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,375
Uh...
Thanks, but no thanks?

47
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,583
I'm a lousy shot anyway;

48
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,500
makes more sense for
you to hold onto them.

49
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:00,291
You're not going to
live with that attitude.

50
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:04,041
Yoo-hoo.

51
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,958
Any day now, rug rats.

52
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,083
Uh, Yuno?

53
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,000
Um...

54
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,166
If we make it out of here alive.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,375
I, uh...

56
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,791
Kind of want to take
you somewhere special,

57
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,208
if that'd be cool.

58
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,458
Of course it is.

59
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,166
Sure. Okay.
Going now.

60
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,916
What's your angle in all this?

61
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,875
Huh...

62
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,916
You sound pissed for someone
who should've seen it coming.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,375
Just make your demands.

64
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:36,708
You know the routine.

65
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,416
Give me swag, you get hostages.

66
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:41,500
First off, car...

67
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,875
Full tank of gas.

68
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:43,916
Then...

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,250
To get you outta
our hair permanently

70
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,791
I want you to kill yourself.

71
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,125
Not going to happen.

72
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,833
Hey! Think I'm kidding
around here?!

73
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,291
Your negotiating power
isn't what you think is.

74
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,750
The building's been
completely surrounded.

75
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,000
The only way out's a body bag.

76
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,958
Or you can swallow your
pride and surrender.

77
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,208
Did you miss the
part about the hostages?!

78
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,791
I have your family!

79
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,166
I'm perfectly aware who
you've got in there with you.

80
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,708
Thing is, you want to live,
you're going to let them go.

81
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,958
I'm the one calling
the shots here.

82
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,208
And the next one will
be through your skull.

83
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,916
I will kill your son,
you stupid bastard!

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,875
He's as good as dead whether
you're the one to do it or not.

85
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,541
His only hope is for me
to win this fucking game!

86
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,041
So it's about to
get real, sweetheart.

87
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,166
Swat team move in
and take them out!

88
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,250
Crazy son of a, bitch!

89
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,333
They're coming up, Yuki!
Get out of there now!

90
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,416
Are you listening to me?!

91
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
Move it!

92
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,333
Freeze, asshole!

93
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,833
Target reigned in!

94
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:45,708
Yuki?

95
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,291
Yuki, no!

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,208
Uryuu was supposed
to talk to him!

97
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,583
Holy shit the little bastard's
carrying a live grenade!

98
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,208
Keep him down.

99
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,875
Captain's on his way.

100
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,333
No, no, no!

101
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,041
Kurusu's going to kill us
all when he gets here!

102
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,416
What are you doing?!

103
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,708
She's got the hostages
in room 413.

104
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,916
Do whatever it takes
to get them out of there.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,333
Sir, this is insane!

106
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,875
We don't have clearance
for these kinds of tactics.

107
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,875
Thank you, officer.

108
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,958
Your services will
no longer be needed.

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,750
Wait...
Seriously?

110
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,333
C'mon, think!

111
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,458
If I don't get out
of here, I'm dead!

112
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,541
I've got to break free!

113
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,083
He's out of his head!

114
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,041
It's over, Gasai!

115
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,541
Back off!

116
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,583
Oh yeah?!

117
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,333
Freeze!

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,708
Amano's my hostage!

119
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,750
Run away, Yuki!

120
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,541
You crazy!

121
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,833
You're mine!

122
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,250
Sea change, little girl.

123
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,083
Now back off!

124
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,833
--Don't you do it!
--Let him go!

125
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,041
Pull it, he dies!

126
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,000
I swear I'll kill us all!

127
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,625
You going to
bargain with his life?

128
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:31,375
Put down the damn grenade!

129
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,333
Back off of him right now.

130
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,250
Don't think I'm afraid
to blow us all to hell!

131
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,291
Five minutes.

132
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,208
Should hopefully do the trick.

133
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,083
We need something
in the way of distraction.

134
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,500
Even if it only buys the kiddos
a couple precious seconds.

135
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:54,166
Now comes the part where
I use my second best skill set.

136
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,000
--Oh, you're kidding me!
--You're kidding me!

137
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,041
Alright, listen.

138
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,250
We'll make a trade.

139
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,958
I'll let Yuki go,
if and only if,

140
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:21,083
you put that thing
down and back away.

141
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,583
Sure...
First move's all you.

142
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,916
Reasonable enough.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,416
Step away slowly, Amano.

144
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,958
Well...
Go on, Yuno.

145
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,666
Don't worry.
I've got this.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,166
What that hell does that mean?

147
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,625
Before you came into my life,

148
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,375
this world was pretty
much dead to me.

149
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,541
If we hadn't met, I wouldn't
have made it as long as I did.

150
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,583
We could be a family
if we got married?

151
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,416
We'll have to
wait till we're older.

152
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,333
Oh, Yuki.

153
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,625
This waiting is driving me nuts.

154
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,750
How much longer
till we're the right age?

155
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,625
C'mon, my love.

156
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,541
Grow up faster!

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,125
This is torture!

158
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,333
You were hope
personified for me.

159
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,208
You were life.

160
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,833
Even if we're not meant to be.

161
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,750
This is the least I can
do to pay you back.

162
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,291
I'm not afraid to die.

163
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,750
Really.

164
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,333
Because I'll still always
be a part of you.

165
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,916
You psychotic little...!

166
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,708
Let go of me!

167
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,666
This is where your future ends,
you son of a bitch!

168
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,666
No!
Don't do it!

169
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,958
You made a promise!

170
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,083
We had a date!

171
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,208
How, how do I keep
running into you?!

172
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,500
How do I keep running into you?

173
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,333
Uncalled for.

174
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:06,750
--Oh, you ass.
--This time, I've got you!

175
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,958
Was that what I...!

176
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,500
Way to go, Yuki.

177
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,833
Didn't think you had the grapes.

178
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
So that wasn't real?

179
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,583
It only incapacitates.

180
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:29,916
The idea is to buy
yourself some time.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,458
As if I'd just hand a
deadly weapon to a kid.

182
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,041
So, uh...

183
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,333
Uh, I'm not an expert, but that
looked pretty damned real to me!

184
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,625
Well, that's probably
because it was real.

185
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,666
That's the bomb I set on four.

186
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,833
I'm so screwed if they're dead.

187
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
Hey!
Hold up!

188
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
Don't give me grief; you're
my ticket out of a Dead End.

189
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,458
Now shut up and pay attention.

190
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,791
Huh?

191
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,250
What's going on?

192
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,291
Yuno!

193
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,958
Oh, thank god.

194
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,958
Can you hear me?

195
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:32,875
No!

196
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,083
How are you still...?

197
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,708
Looks like Lady Luck
has a thing for me.

198
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,375
Sucks for you.

199
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,708
I'd give you the whole
"this hurts me more" spiel,

200
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:45,250
but it wouldn't
strictly speaking be fact.

201
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,916
Sorry it came to this.

202
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,416
Really, kid?

203
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,750
We both know
you don't have in you.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,416
Even if you did...

205
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,375
How good's your aim?

206
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,541
Trust me,
you'll want to be sure.

207
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,208
I...
didn't mean...

208
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:14,958
You're not a killer.

209
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Flip side, though I am.

210
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,000
Welcome back, sunshine.

211
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:22,833
I suggest that you behave.

212
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,250
You get wiggly on me,

213
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,708
I'm liable to slip and cut
your pretty little throat.

214
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,541
You won't win.

215
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Ha! I believe the
woman has faith in you, kid.

216
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,333
I can't do this.

217
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,958
If I miss, I'll hit Yuno.

218
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,666
What am I supposed
to do, though?

219
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,166
Either way, she's a goner.

220
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Give me something.

221
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,083
Damn it, no!

222
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,541
If I fire, Yuno's dead!

223
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,000
What do I do?
What do I do?

224
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,583
Problem?

225
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,500
Something in that diary
giving you second thoughts?

226
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,000
You're pale as death.

227
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,458
I can't drop the gun.

228
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,041
Without it, he wouldn't
waste a second killing us.

229
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,541
I hate this.

230
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,208
Shoot him, Yuki.

231
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,041
Go on, my love.

232
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,666
If it goes through
me, then so be it.

233
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,791
I still stand by what
I said about you and me.

234
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,541
Sure, you were just
calling me your girlfriend

235
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,250
to appease me
or whatever, but hey...

236
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
A girl in my position's
not about to look

237
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
a gift horse in the mouth.

238
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,958
I mean, come on.

239
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,791
You took it far enough
to do a mock wedding.

240
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,083
You need to shut
your mouth, girl.

241
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,166
You're satisfied for
him to lie to you?

242
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,250
You've got a lot to learn about
self respect, let alone love.

243
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,458
Stupid teenagers and
your B.S. make me sick!

244
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,250
Oh, man.

245
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,416
Yuno.

246
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,000
You've been carrying this thing
around with you the whole time?

247
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,083
Why not?

248
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,208
Because you ought
to have the sense

249
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,041
to want better for
yourself, damn it!

250
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,291
Why've you been
stalking me for a year if

251
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,833
you're willing to let
it end like this?!

252
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,583
We were going to be married!

253
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,041
I was just living in a dream.

254
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,458
Save...

255
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,458
Saving you is as
good as it'll get for me.

256
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,041
Shut up!

257
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:21,416
You deserve better than to be
treated like a sacrificial lamb!

258
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,625
I wasn't just calling you my
girlfriend to appease you!

259
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,458
You're going to be
my bride one day!

260
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,291
Maybe it's all just
been a dream to you.

261
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,916
But to me, it's reality!

262
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,041
Yuki.

263
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,083
If you want her
to die, go ahead.

264
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,125
If you care for her you'll
put down the damn gun!

265
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,083
I'm sorry, Kurusu.

266
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,083
Not an option.

267
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,500
Because I don't just
care for her... I love her.

268
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,541
How did you do that?

269
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,541
Goddammit, I'm not going to die!

270
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,375
I won't be taken out
by a punk like you!

271
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,708
I... I tried to warn you.

272
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,791
Please, just stop.

273
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:26,250
The throne of
space-time is mine!

274
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,625
I will become god!

275
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,291
I have to!

276
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,416
Put it down, chief.

277
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,166
Bang-on for timing, huh?

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,750
Kurusu.

279
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,541
Stay out of this.

280
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,458
I know you killed Karyuudo;

281
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,541
that you had the gall to try
and pin it on a couple of kids.

282
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,083
Uyruu and I had a good,
long talk on the way here.

283
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,666
What kind of cop takes the word
of a terrorist at face value?

284
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,375
A bad one.

285
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,041
Believe it or not, I've come
here to make a deal with you.

286
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,583
What'd you have in mind?

287
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,541
I'm offering to
call the uniforms off...

288
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,000
You got me.

289
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,708
Drop the weapon now.

290
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,166
You, you're under arrest.

291
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,083
Oh yeah?

292
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,250
How's it feel?

293
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,375
To be on the wrong
side of the law, I mean.

294
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,916
Your diary's useless
now, I'm afraid.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,833
You know... since you're
no longer a real cop.

296
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:39,083
Makes sense, I guess.

297
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,125
How are my wife and son?

298
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,625
Good.

299
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:45,041
Swat team pulled them out
just before the bomb exploded.

300
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:47,291
They're shook up, but safe.

301
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,791
That's alright then.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,166
Do me a favor, Ninth.

303
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,291
I hate to ask you to team
up with me again, but...

304
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,416
In return.

305
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,291
I'll deal myself out.

306
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,208
What are you doing?!

307
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,375
Watch over my son.

308
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,458
I can do that.

309
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,666
For what it's worth,
Yuki, I'm sorry.

310
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,083
Doesn't mean much coming
from a bastard like me, I know.

311
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:28,208
But you're going
to win this game.

312
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,166
I know it!

313
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,083
Detective Nishijima was put in

314
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,666
charge of his former
chief's cases, naturally.

315
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,000
As you might imagine,

316
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,541
the badges had a lot of
questions for Yuno and me.

317
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,500
Lucky for us the files
Kurusu used to cover his

318
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,708
butt went a long way
toward clearing our names.

319
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,000
It's hard to say
when he went rogue.

320
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:58,041
I like to think his better
side held out for a while.

321
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,583
Of course, the media made a
huge deal out of the whole mess.

322
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,708
Corrupt cops,
terrorists, all that.

323
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,333
But our names
were kept out of it.

324
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:08,625
And evidently, Ninth made
good on another escape.

325
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,041
Ah, crap!
I'm going to be late!

326
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,041
There was a silver
lining, though.

327
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,083
Turns out the cop
I shot survived

328
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:19,750
and is expected to
make a full recovery.

329
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,416
You going to keep me in
suspense the whole afternoon?

330
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Maybe.

331
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,958
We're stopping by dad's place on
the way to pick up my telescope,

332
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,916
if that gives you a
clue what the plan is.

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,958
Think somewhere
with a good view.

334
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't think there are words
for how happy I am.

335
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,250
Quality time with
my man, stargazing.

336
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,458
This'll be the romantic outing
to put all others to shame!

337
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,666
Wow...
No pressure or anything.

338
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,416
Oh, whatever!

339
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,375
It's going to be great!

340
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,666
Just live in the now!

341
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,041
That's what eternal
life is really all about.

342
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,625
You don't say?

343
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,083
Looks like somebody's
been practicing

344
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,958
their moves on the
pillow at night.

345
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:15,166
Aw, leave me alone.

346
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,833
We're sorry.

347
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,416
The party you're trying to
reach is currently unavailable.

348
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,958
Please try again later.

349
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:21,833
We're sorry.

350
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,666
Give me a break.

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,291
What's the matter, sweetie?

352
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,625
Dad's phone is out
of range, or something.

353
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
Thought he'd be home now.

354
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,041
Last one on board has
to massage the winner's feet!

355
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:37,208
What?

356
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,041
Yuno... Wait up!

357
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,791
Should I or shouldn't I?

358
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,333
Since the train's not here yet.

359
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm going to go make a pit stop.

360
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,083
Back in a sec.

361
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,250
I'll get us something
to drink, too.

362
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,208
Kay.

363
00:19:58,416 --> 00:19:59,625
Akise?

364
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,916
Who's that supposed to be?

365
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,791
Do I know this person?

366
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,958
Sorry about that.

367
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,500
Hey... You're going
to wind up losing this thing.

368
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,791
Thanks.

369
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,375
Did anybody try to call me?

370
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,708
You got some spam
but I got rid of it.

371
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,958
Kind of a large bag to
be taking on a day trip.

372
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:28,541
Yeah.

373
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,875
But hey.,,

374
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,708
When you surprise her, a girl's
gotta be prepared.

375
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:33,916
Were you expecting me to
take you on a tour of Europe?

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,125
No, silly.

377
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,791
I just thought I'd bring
a change of clothes,

378
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,333
and first aid stuff.

379
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:42,000
And maybe some unmentionables.

380

So to recap, you've been
chosen as a Diary Keeper;

382
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:26,625
if you have any
questions, now would

383
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,916
be the time to spit them out.

384
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,625
Large mocha,
extra whipped cream.

385
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:30,333
Thanks!

386
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,833
You're totally fabulous.

387
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,500
Thank you.

388
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,333
Well, enjoy.

389
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,750
Back when I was kid.

390
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,208
I wanted this model toy.

391
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,791
It was called a Gyan.

392
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,375
So, you like to be random.

393
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,041
Hey.

394
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,083
Listen.

395
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,583
A Friend told me I was an idiot.

396
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,583
Told me I ough
to go with a Zaku.

397
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,625
But I wouldn't be
talked out of that Gyan.

398
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:52,833
Well, my thing was always.

399
00:22:52,916 --> 00:22:53,791
Just hear me out.

400
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,583
Alrighty.

401
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,875
I'm not rambling here;
this is how I became a cop.

402
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,208
See, I wanted the
Gyan so bad I stole it.

403
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,750
Sounds like the
opposite of being a cop.

404
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,875
The old man found out
about it from the shop keep

405
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,708
and beat the crap out of me.

406
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,625
So, he set you on
the straight and narrow.

407
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:11,708
My old man?

408
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,083
Like hell.

409
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,833
He's was a career criminal.

410
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:17,041
Specialized in
breaking and entering.

411
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,791
Should I be hunkering
down for a long one, or?

412
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,375
Mind you, he was unemployable,

413
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,125
so he didn't have much choice
if he wanted to survive.

414
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,125
Not that it helped
him last long.

415
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:31,083
Anyway, point is, I often
ask myself why no one

416
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,500
was there to beat
the crap out of him.

417
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,750
But you just said
that didn't help you.

418
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,875
Or are you saying you became
a cop so you could kick his ass?

419
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,916
Suppose that's one
way of looking at it.

420
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,541
Thanks for the diary.

421
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,166
Should come in very handy.

422
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,916
Always good
to know who you'll be

423
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,208
beating the ever
living crap out of.

424
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,875
Did he just make
off with my umbrella?
