00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,166
What do you think, Gridman?

172
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,250
[GRIDMAN]
Both opinions are valid.

173
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,791
This conflict was
bound to happen.

174
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:59,416
That's a fancy way of
dodging the question.

175
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,541
[GRIDMAN]
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,666
Don't be, it's a
tough situation.

177
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,333
But we don't have time.

178
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:06,208
Like it or not, we're gonna
end up fighting this

179
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,916
Alexis thing one
way or another.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,583
[RIKKA sisgh] Fine, then you
can count me out.

181
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,500
Hey, where are you going?

182
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,583
You can go ahead and do what
you think is right without me.

183
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,291
If you wanna fight, then fight.

184
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,666
Why are you so angry?

185
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,875
I'm not angry.

186
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,291
Yeah, you tell yourself that.
Hear me out.

187
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,750
It's not that I'm eager to
go and pick a fight with her,

188
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,083
but the Gridman Alliance
has no other option.

189
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,666
I've been wanting to
point this out for a while,

190
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,000
but only you call us
the Gridman Alliance.

191
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,000
What?

192
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,166
Anyway, fact is,
Akane's my friend.

193
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,208
I'll never be behind an idea
where we end up fighting her.

194
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:44,083
[UTSUMI sighs]
Man, this is a real pain.

195
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,208
You always let your emotions
do all the thinking for you.

196
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,125
[inhlaes]

197
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,958
[BORR]
Well that went terribly.

198
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,041
[UTSUMI]
I think I screwed up.

199
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,125
[YUTA]
Yup. Big time.

200
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,916
[UTSUMI groans] All the girls
at school are gonna think

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,833
I'm a huge ass from
now on! I'm done for.

202
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,875
My high school life barely
started and it's already over.

203
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,666
It's only second semester!

204
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,333
Listen man, I get that this
is a bad moment for you...

205
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,041
[UTSUMI] It is. But there's
no time for that!

206
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,250
Right now our focus needs
to be on Akane Shinjo.

207
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,666
[YUTA]
That's right.

208
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,041
If we don't do something quick,
it'll all end for good.

209
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,916
This time, we have to
stop her ourselves.

210
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:46,625
[AKANE] Are you for real?
You want me to "take it back"?

211
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,708
[YUTA]
If we're gonna fight,

212
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,916
let's do it at another
time and place.

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,583
[giggles]
Hold on a sec.

214
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,708
Are you actually
trying to stop me?

215
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,583
We'd like to know why
you'd target the festival.

216
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,791
It's because I hate it.

217
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,125
I know you guys don't want to
be part of the stupid thing

218
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,000
any more than I do.

219
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,291
And don't you think
seeing my kaiju in action

220
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,833
would be way cooler?

221
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,208
I know you do.

222
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:11,500
It doesn't make sense.

223
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,583
I thought you were
after Gridman.

224
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,458
Well, yeah, there's that, but...

225
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,833
In that case, there's no reason
put anyone else in harm's way.

226
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,666
Sorry, I'm leaving.
Got Phys. Ed next.

227
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,000
[YUTA]
No, wait!

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,833
[stomach growls]

229
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,750
[BORR]
That's one old sponge.

230
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:36,791
[ALL]
Hm?

231
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,541
[BORR]
Calibur, sit down.

232
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:45,083
You want somethin', or you
here to lose another fight?

233
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,458
Where is the girl?
I'm looking for her.

234
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,208
What girl?

235
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:51,791
[RIKKA'S MOM]
Oh, a customer?

236
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,250
Hm? Is there anything
I can get you?

237
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,791
That's not...

238
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,333
[RIKKA'S MOM]
Uh...?!

239
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:06,416
[RIKKA'S MOM] Here you are.
Sorry it's nothing fancy.

240
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,708
Uh... Okay. Is this
kid a friend of yours?

241
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,125
I assure you he's not.

242
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,625
I mean, does he look
like he'd be our friend?

243
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,541
--[RIKKA'S MOM] Mm-hm.
--[VIT gasps]

244
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,458
[MAX] Why didn't you
chase him down before?

245
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,416
You could have defeated him.

246
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,708
Felt like Yuta
wouldn't let me.

247
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,916
[MAX]
Hm.

248
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,750
[BORR]
I'm gonna stop you right there.

249
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,708
You have something
to say to Mama?

250
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:42,041
Or do I need to
teach you manners?

251
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,041
Hey!

252
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:45,875
[CALIBUR]
You have a phone, right?

253
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,708
[BORR]
Huh?

254
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,416
[CALIBUR]
All right. You can go.

255
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,541
[BORR]
Don't just let him walk away!

256
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:55,833
I got his cell number. You can
teach him some manners later.

257
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,625
[gasps]

258
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,541
Hey, Max! Aren't you
gonna step in?

259
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,083
This guy has some screws loose!

260
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:02,291
[MAX sighs]

261
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,291
[BORR] Don't you give
me that lazy shrug.

262
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,291
Hibiki told me everything.

263
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,958
How you were the one who
killed Tonkawa and the others.

264
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,250
It wasn't me.

265
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,833
It was my kaiju that
killed all of those girls.

266
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,375
So you're fine with what
you've been causing?

267
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,708
[AKANE] Kaiju are what
make this city go 'round.

268
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,958
Sometimes it has to be fixed.

269
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,458
Besides, did you even
get along with Tonkawa

270
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,708
and the other girls?

271
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:41,250
I wouldn't say that I
didn't get along with them.

272
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,250
So it's same with
or without them.

273
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,750
It's not the same.

274
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,916
Then why don't you
just kill me?

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
That'd settle everything,
wouldn't it?

276
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,083
No, that wouldn't
settle anything.

277
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,166
[chuckles] I always knew
you were a good girl.

278
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,958
So different from
the rest of them.

279
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,375
You're the person who
should be close to me.

280
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,041
I'm the what?

281
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,125
Wouldn't you like to
get along with a god?

282
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,666
You might as well accept it:
no matter what I do,

283
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,125
you'll never be able to hate me.

284
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,291
I made sure you were
set up to be that way.

285
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,208
[RIKKA gasps]

286
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,916
[AKANE] Everyone who lives
here has no choice but to love

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,083
everything about me.

288
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,875
That's why you and I
are friends, Rikka.

289
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,916
Are you saying I was born
already as your friend?

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,500
[AKANE]
That's right.

291
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,333
You were made to be my friend
when you were made by my kaiju.

292
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,083
[ANNOUNCER]
Departing. Please hold on.

293
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,958
[RIKKA]
The festival is tomorrow.

294
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,916
[RIKKA] I tried talking
to Akane earlier today,

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,708
but it was useless.
I couldn't stop her.

296
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,250
I've been thinking.

297
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:13,708
That junk computer and the
shop belong to my parents.

298
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,375
So in a way, I haven't
contributed anything myself.

299
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,416
[YUTA]
I don't think that's true.

300
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:24,291
We've only been able to
get this far because everyone

301
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,791
was working together.

302
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,583
There have been plenty of
times that we wouldn't have

303
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,750
made it if you weren't with us.

304
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,666
I know Utsumi feels
that way. And me.

305
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,916
I want you to be here with--!

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,291
Tomorrow!

307
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm going to
apologize to Utsumi.

308
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:47,416
Huh? But he was the one who
said all of the nasty stuff.

309
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,041
[RIKKA]
I want to apologize first.

310
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,833
How come?

311
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,708
That guy. You know him.

312
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,500
He'd never expect me
to make the first move.

313
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,416
[gasps]
The first move. That's it!

314
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,791
[dog barks]

315
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,791
[ALEXIS] The school
festival is tomorrow, yes?

316
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,041
[AKANE]
Mm.

317
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:09,666
[ALEXIS] You don't seem
too excited about it.

318
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,541
Oh, that isn't true at all.
I absolutely am.

319
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:14,541
[ALEXIS]
That's wonderful to hear!

320
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,208
I'm sure everybody
is looking forward

321
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:18,708
to seeing your big performance.

322
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,083
[AKANE]
Well, yeah.

323
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,708
[ALEXIS] Hopefully, they will
all enjoy the show.

324
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:27,333
Lots of guests will be
coming from all over.

325
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:29,083
That's exactly
why I can't lose.

326
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:34,125
[STUDENTS chattering]

327
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,333
Do it. Now's the time.

328
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,250
Very well. Instance Abreactio--

329
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:44,583
[AKANE]
Wait...! What's going on?

330
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:49,625
[STUDENTS scream]

331
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:57,083
[STUDENTS gaspsing]

332
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
[FEMALE STUDENT A gasps]
Look at that thing!

333
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,833
Deploying Gridman first
to prompt an evacuation.

334
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,375
Not a bad idea.

335
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,083
This way, Shinjo has less of a
reason to attack the school,

336
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,500
am I right?

337
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:19,250
[AKANE] They sure do
know how to ruin the fun.

338
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,625
Now, Alexis!

339
