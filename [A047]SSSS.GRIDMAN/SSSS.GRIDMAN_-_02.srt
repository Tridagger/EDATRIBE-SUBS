173
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,375
[RIKKA]
He's right!

174
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,333
[YUTA]
You both see them, too?

175
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,000
[UTSUMI]
Yeah.

176
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,375
That's crazy.

177
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:16,375
Have we've been living next
to them all this time?

178
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,916
[CALIBUR]
W-We're here.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,916
Rikka, if you would?
Pretty please?

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,750
Please?

181
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,125
Uh! Why do I have to?

182
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,791
[TONKAWA'S DAD]
Welcome!

183
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,750
Um, sir, excuse me?

184
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,166
Yeah?

185
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,041
I'm, uh, looking for a friend
of mine. Sakiru Tonkawa.

186
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,625
I'm Rikka Takarada
from her high school.

187
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:49,583
From her high school?
What is this? What're you doing?

188
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,916
[RIKKA]
Huh?

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,916
We stopped by because she
wasn't in class today.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,625
[TONKAWA'S DAD]
Of course she wasn't.

191
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,125
Our girl died when she
was in middle school.

192
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,791
In an accident.

193
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,791
[RIKKA, UTSUMI]
Middle school?

194
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,916
But, sir, she was
there just yesterday.

195
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,791
Now you listen.

196
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,208
I think we mighta
pushed his buttons.

197
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,541
[RIKKA]
What does this mean?

198
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,875
[YUTA] She couldn't have
died during middle school.

199
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,166
[CALIBUR]
L-Let's go.

200
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,541
Hold up. Mister Samurai!

201
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:24,958
[YUTA] After that, we went to
the other four's houses.

202
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,791
But it was the same
story with all of them.

203
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,500
[AKANE]
Yes! Yes! They're dead!

204
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,166
[AKANE, ALEXIS laugh]

205
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,291
[ALEXIS]
How wonderful.

206
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,458
[UTSUMI]
It's scorching.

207
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,208
Nothing for you?

208
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,791
I can't do carbonated drinks.

209
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:01,125
Y'know, shaking that
won't get it out.

210
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:05,041
[RIKKA] Why is it that the
five of them are dead now?

211
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,541
They were fine just yesterday.

212
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:12,291
They... They were all
attacked by kaiju, so...

213
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:16,750
[RIKKA] Does this mean we're
never going to see them again?

214
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,083
[UTSUMI] Even though all those
people told us they were dead,

215
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,833
it still doesn't feel like it.

216
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:22,958
Yeah.

217
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,250
[RIKKA]
How can you be so calm?

218
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:29,541
I dunno. Prob'ly cuz the whole
situation hasn't sunk in yet.

219
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:33,208
Besides, Rikka, were you even
friends with Tonkawa and them?

220
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,125
[sighs]

221
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,375
[RIKKA]
What does that matter?

222
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,833
That's not even what
I'm talking about.

223
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,416
[clang]

224
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,750
[footsteps]

225
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,000
[CALIBUR]
C-Can you drink this?

226
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,625
Thanks, that's really
nice of you.

227
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,833
[RIKKA] I just don't want any
more friends to disappear.

228
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:23,916
I don't want all of our good
memories to disappear.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,916
And for me to be the only
one left who remembers.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,208
I can't stand the
thought of that.

231
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:37,166
I doubt anyone could, which...
which is why we have to fight.

232
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,041
I know. If another kaiju
appears, I want him to fight.

233
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,708
Because only they can do it.

234
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,625
Only Hibiki and Gridman
can protect my friends.

235
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,250
Then I think you
should tell him that.

236
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:54,000
[RIKKA]
I can't.

237
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,833
[AKANE]
Look! My new creation!

238
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,625
[ALEXIS] Wow! It's magnificent!
What will you use it for?

239
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,208
[giggles]

240
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, I was thinking of killing
my homeroom teacher with it.

241
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:05,916
[ALEXIS]
Oh?

242
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,125
[AKANE] Who runs into someone
and doesn't even apologize?

243
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,208
So rude.

244
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,833
[ALEXIS]
That's not nice at all.

245
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,083
I know! So, I'm counting on you.

246
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:18,166
[ALEXIS] But of course.
Instance Abreaction!

247
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:20,916
[gasps]

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
[sirens wailing]

249
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:26,166
[YUTA]
I knew it. Another kaiju.

250
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,875
[CALIBUR]
One's coming?

251
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,708
A kaiju...

252
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,833
[roars]

253
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,333
What the hell is that?

254
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,625
[gasps]

255
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,041
[AKANE]
Oh, there you are, sir!

256
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,750
Hey, where are you going?
School's still in session!

257
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,833
You ought to be with
the students, not out here!

258
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,708
That was totally wild!

259
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,166
Watch where you're
aiming, will you?

260
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,458
I've gotta go.

261
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,916
[UTSUMI] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hold on a sec!

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,458
This is dangerous!

263
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,958
[YUTA] But people are
going to die again.

264
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,791
I've gotta go
fight with Gridman.

265
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,750
[UTSUMI] This is just way
out of character for you.

266
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,458
[YUTA]
It might be, but...

267
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,875
Utsumi. we're the
Gridman Alliance, right?

268
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,166
Well... Yeah. We are.

269
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,875
[YUTA]
C'mon, let's get to Junk.

270
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,125
[UTSUMI]
Right!

271
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,083
[ALL gasp]

272
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,500
[ALL scream]

273
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,458
Wow. Thank you for that!

274
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,208
That was too close.

275
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,500
Let's go, Utsumi!

276
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,750
Yeah!

277
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,416
[CALIBUR] I told you
that we'd have to fight.

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,791
So, what will you do?
Not much time.

279
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:27,833
[AKANE] I wonder if my
teacher actually died...

280
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:30,500
Well, not that it
really matters.

281
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:38,125
Gridman, please! I need
you to fight with me!

282
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,250
[GRIDMAN]
In this world,

283
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,875
I am merely energy
without substance.

284
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:46,250
Unless I merge with you,
I won't be able to fight.

285
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:51,791
Something only I can do.
Something... that I must do!

286
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,958
[GRIDMAN] That is your
and my Primal Acceptor.

287
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,291
You'll have to "Access Flash"
with me when you're ready.

288
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,458
Right!

289
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,916
Access... Flash!

290
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,166
[whimpers]

291
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,666
[YUTA] I feel so light!
Is that because of Gridman?

292
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,583
His color and moves
are different!

293
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,333
[YUTA]
I can hear you over there!

294
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:56,375
This must be the
optimized Gridman.

295
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,125
Yes! Go pulverize it!

296
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:22,000
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Grid... Beam!

297
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,875
[YUTA (GRIDMAN) grunts]

298
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,291
It just reflected the beam!

299
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:32,125
[AKANE giggles]
My beam counter was perfect!

300
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,916
[ALEXIS]
Well done, Akane!

301
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,875
[UTSUMI]
Not this again!

302
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,250
[RIKKA]
He's gonna lose at this rate.

303
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,125
The kaiju, doesn't it
have any weak points?

304
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:55,500
No idea.

305
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,166
[RIKKA]
Can you stop that thing?

306
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,625
No, I can't.

307
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:01,291
For real?

308
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,041
Look, if you're a
friend of Gridman,

309
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,875
then please, do something
to help him out!

310
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,208
That, I actually can do.

311
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:15,750
Access Code: Gridman Calibur!

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,250
[CALIBUR]
Gridman! Put me to work!

313
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,708
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Right!

314
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,833
Electric Great Sword!

315
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,416
Gridman Calibur!

316
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,833
What the--?!
This guy's got weapons?

317
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,750
[ALEXIS]
What a pesky guest.

318
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,291
[AKANE]
Come on, don't you lose to that!

319
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,708
[CALIBUR] Hey, Gridman,
let's slice it apart!

320
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,916
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Right!

321
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,916
[GRIDMAN]
Grid....

322
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,083
[CALIBUR]
...Calibur....

323
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,916
[YUTA (GRIDMAN), CALIBUR]
...End!

324
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,541
Hell yeah!

325
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:18,166
--Hibiki.
--Yuta!

326
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,958
Uh. Thank you so
much for your help.

327
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,208
[CALIBUR]
Hm.

328
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,416
What was with the sword?
That wasn't even fair!

329
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,791
[ALEXIS] Mm-mm-mm.
Always such a violent girl.

330
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,791
[YUTA]
"What I must do."

331
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:42,958
I did what only I can do,
together with Gridman.

332
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,875
But... this destroyed city,

333
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:48,666
and the memories of the
people who live here...

334
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,000
...will once again be...

335
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,500
[RIKKA sighs]

336
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,166
I just got a hold of
Namiko and Hass.

337
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,958
They're fine.
I'm off to meet them.

338
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,041
Thanks for everything.

339
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,916
Who was that meant for?

340
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,333
[GRIDMAN] Yuta, thanks to you,
I was able to fight today.

341
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:19,083
Yeah, but what about all the
people we weren't able to save?
