Oh. You're awake.

Good morning. If it is.

12
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,083
You were out for almost half an
hour and I couldn't wake you up.

13
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,833
Do you feel alright?

14
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,708
[YUTA] Um. I'm not in
pain or anything.

Cool. I think. Nice to
meet you, Gridman.

34
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:52,208
[GRIDMAN] You have to
remember your calling.

Wait, I have a calling?

00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,250
What're you doing?

remember what my calling is.

Your calling? Like what
you're called?

No, something else I think.

Huh? Then what do you mean?

50

Where are we, anyway?

51
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,791
Home. But to you, it's the shop.

00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,333
Whose?

53
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:34,375
Mine, of course!

54
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:35,916
Yeah, but that
doesn't tell me who.

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,875
"Doesn't tell you?"
Who do you mean by who?

for you to walk him

00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,375

Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you two
in the same class together?

00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,375
Aw...

72
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,833
If he's suffering memory loss,

73
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,250
it could mean he hit
his head on something.

74
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,125

good.

seeing and hearing things.

Is it?

[YUTA]
Behind you! Up there!

82
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,083
There's a kaiju! It's humongous!

Huh? Where at?

84
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,083

[YUTA] No, no no.
I see it! It's right there!

87
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:49,666
[RIKKA sighs] Let's get moving
before the hospital closes.

88
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,750
[RIKKA]
Hey, if you lost your memory,

89
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,875
does that mean you don't
remember anything

90
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,083

91
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,166

Nope.

92
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,291
[RIKKA]
I see. Okay.

93
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,875
But, if you are just
pretending to have amnesia,

94
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,916
then you really suck.

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,916
Uh. Did something happen?

96
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,708
So how did it go?

97
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:23,708
A lot of it went over my head,
but they said I'd be back

98
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,958
to normal before long.

99
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,500
Least there's that.

100
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,208
Oh, hey, do you even
have an insurance card?

101
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,083
Insurance?

102
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:36,291
[RIKKA sighs]
You can go home, right?

103
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,500
[YUTA] Mm. Thanks for
taking care of me.

104
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,666
[RIKKA]
Hm?

105
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,458
[YUTA]
Well, see you.

106
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,583
[RIKKA]
See you.

107
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,958
[RIKKA]
What's wrong?

108
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:51,958
I don't exactly
know where to go.

109
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,250
[RIKKA gasps] You forgot
your home address too?

110
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,166
Well, I don't have a clue
where you live either.

111
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,208
[gasps] Wait, hand me
your cell phone.

112
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:00,833
[YUTA]
Oh, right.

113
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,000
[RIKKA]
I'll text Utsumi.

114
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,333
He could probably
be able to help out.

115
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:08,875
Ah, okay. Yeah. I know
where this is. Got it.

116
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,625
But it's pretty far from here.

117
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,000
You don't say.

118
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,333
On top of that,
it's already seven!

[RIKKA groans]

120
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,125
[RIKKA]
And I am starving.

121
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:27,375
Why was I sleeping at
some girl's house anyway?

122
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,166
I'm not just some girl.
The name's Rikka Takarada.

123
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,708
[YUTA]
Hm?

124
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,875
And, Hibiki, we found you lying
unconscious in front of our

125
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,000
place and nothing we
did could wake you.

126
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:41,041
What do you mean?
Uh, do we have a history?

127
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,833
Are we friends?

128
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:47,208
[sighs]
Got a newsflash.

129
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:49,416
Today is the most we've
ever spoken to each other

130
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,166
since we were put into
the same classroom.

131
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,791
Oh, I see.

132
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,375
That hit the spot.

133
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,291
[YUTA]
Uh?

134
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:01,291
Whoa... What's up with him?

135
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,708
Should I leave you here?

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,916
Huh? No, I'm ready to go.

137
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,541
[YUTA]
This is the address.

138
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,666
[RIKKA]
Awesome. I'll be off then.

139
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,750
Utsumi said he'd come by and
pick you up tomorrow morning.

140
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:21,041
[YUTA]
Great. Thanks for everything.

141
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,041
[RIKKA]
Bye.

142
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:28,166
[YUTA]
I'm home.

143
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,750
It's dark...

144
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,666
[YUTA]
After looking around the house,

145
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,750
I discovered my parents
were on a business trip.

146
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,291
They wouldn't return
home for three months.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
[YUTA] It seemed unreal,
like someone else's life.

148
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,166
[YUTA]
Gridman. Does he exist?

149
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,958
[YUTAQ]
Or was it a hallucination?

150
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:08,875
[YUTA] You wouldn't happen
to be Utsumi, would you?

151
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,125
It looks like you
weren't kidding

152
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,333
about having memory loss.

153
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,375
You don't even remember
my face, do you?

154
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,041
I'm sorry, no.

155
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,458
[UTSUMI]
Whatever.

156
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,041
We only started getting to
know each other in April.

157
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,083
We'll pretend we've just
become friends again.

158
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,500
[YUTA]
Thanks. So um...

159
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,750
[UTSUMI]
What is it?

160
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,166
[YUTA] You know...
What kind of person am I?

161
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,166
[UTSUMI] That's a heavy question
to suddenly drop on me.

162
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,708
What kind of person
are you? Let's see...

163
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,375
I'd describe you as... regular.

164
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,250
Not a bad guy at all.

165
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,458
[YUTA] By the way, you wouldn't
happen to have heard of

166
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,291
something called Gridman?

167
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,250
[UTSUMI]
Nope. Is it a new trend?

168
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,833
[YUTA]
I wouldn't say that.

169
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:52,458
So get this,
yesterday when I was...

170
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,000
[NAMIKO] Guess what?
I saw you two yesterday.

171
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,166
[gasps]

172
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,750
You were walking
side-by-side with Hibiki.

173
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,916
[HASS]
He's a boy.

[YUTA] I know what I must do.
This Kaiju has to be stopped.

345
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,916
I think Yuta's voice
just came out of Junk.

346
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,333
[YUTA (GRIDMAN) grunts]

347
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,125
[KAIJU A roars]

348
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,416
[YUTA (GRIDMAN) grunts]

349
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,083
[roars]

350
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:32,916
[UTSUMI]
He's transformed.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,166
When he got sucked up,
Yuta became Gridman.

352
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,833
He's defending the city
against the kaiju!

353
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,500
[RIKKA]
Junk's going haywire!

354
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,500
[UTSUMI] Old computers are
cooler than I ever imagined!

355
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,708
Wait. You don't suppose
Junk is somehow

356
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,750
connected to Gridman, do you?

357
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,375
What if it's telling us
that he's in trouble?

358
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,916
[groans] If only this
was the Ultra series!

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,375
Then the kaiju would have
some kind of weak point!

360
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,250
[RIKKA]
Uh. You lost me.

361
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,041
[YUTA]
Damn it! Why can't I move?

362
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,208
[UTSUMI exhales]

363
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,875
[UTSUMI]
Found it.

364
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,250
The neck is weaker than
the rest of its body!

365
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,500
If he goes after it...

366
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,625
[RIKKA] We have to tell
Hibiki right away!

367
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:19,166
[UTSUMI]
Well, yeah. But how?

368
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,291
[RIKKA]
Uh...

369
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,916
[YUTA] The school!
The school's on fire!

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,166
[RIKKA]
You're kidding!

371
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,416
We can hear him fine,
but he's not reading us.

372
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,750
Isn't there some
way to contact him?

373
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,416
[UTSUMI]
Maybe through the computer?

374
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,166
It's the best option we have.

375
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,375
Tell me what we should say,

376
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,833
and I'll type it on
the keyboard, Utsumi.

377
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,958
[UTSUMI grunts]

378
00:19:49,791 --> 00:19:51,291
Dang she's fast.

379
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,125
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
I hear you.

380
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,541
[YUTA]
I hear you.

381
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,333
Rikka and Utsumi.

382
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,375
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Loud and clear!

383
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,916
[roars]

384
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,166
[YUTA (GRIDMAN) grunts]

385
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,583
Amazing...

386
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,583
Go, Gridman! Take him down!

387
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,125
[YUTA (GRIDMAN)]
Grid...

388
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:56,166
...Beam!

389
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,125
[UTSUMI]
He did it! Yes! We won!

390
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,000
[BOTH gasp]

391
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,750
[UTSUMI] Hey, are you okay?
Say something!

392
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:30,041
I... Guess I'm back.

393
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,125
That was amazing, Yuta!
You fought a kaiju and won!

394
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,416
We saw the whole thing!

395
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,041
I can't take all of the credit.

396
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,041
[GRIDMAN]
Yuta!

397
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,458
[YUTA, UTSUMI]
Hm?

398
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,791
[GRIDMAN] Yuta, you must
complete your mission.

399
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,958
[YUTA]
But I thought I just did.

400
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:48,541
[GRIDMAN]
This is only the beginning.

401
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,541
[YUTA gasps]

402
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,958
Okay, pause!

403
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,125
Did the three of us and
Gridman just beat that thing?

404
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,250
[YUTA]
Uh... Yeah.

405
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,791
That makes us a team,

406
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,541
which means we need to come
up with a name for our group!

407
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:02,083
I'm thinking of something like,
"The Gridman Alliance".

408
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:06,291
I hate to say this, but I'm
finished for today.

409
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,541
[UTSUMI]
Huh?

410
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,000
[RIKKA] My head feels
completely scrambled.

411
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,166
I still don't know who
or what Gridman is.

412
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,291
Plus, I'm worried about
whether my friends are safe.

413
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,083
I'm sorry, but right now...

414
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:21,750
Oh... Think we should go?

415
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,083
[RIKKA'S MOTHER]
Rikka!

416
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,916
Oh. Thank goodness
you kids are okay!

417
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,583
Honestly. Would it have killed
you to answer your phone?

418
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,791
[RIKKA]
Huh?

419
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,916
[RIKKA'S MOTHER]
Don't "huh" me, young lady.

420
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,833
I was in a panic.

421
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,541
Yeah, we should probably go.

422
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:37,583
[YUTA]
Mm.

423
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,500
Coming up next,
reactions from eye-witnesses.

424
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,416
[MALE REPORTER]
The question remains,

425
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,083
where did the
beast come from?

426
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,083
[FEMALE REPORTER]
What did you do?

427
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,833
After it started
heading your way?

428
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,500
[ALEXIS] It would appear we had
some unexpected company show up.

429
00:23:20,208 --> 00:23:25,375
[UTSUMI] Whoa. You see what
I see? Or am I just crazy?

430
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,375
I could have sworn the school
burnt down yesterday.

431
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,125
What's up?

432
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:33,625
Oh, uh. Well, look.

433
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:36,583
Whoa... No way...

434
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,416
[RIKKA]
The school's back to normal.

435
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,875
[YUTA]
Something weird is going on.

436
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,250
[UTSUMI, RIKKA]
Uh-huh.
