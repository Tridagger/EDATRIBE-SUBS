343
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,041
[ALEXIS] It would appear
Anti was no good after all.

344
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,000
There's only one able
to make true kaiju.

345
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,458
And it's the one who's
truly a human, you.

346
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,750
Yeah... Something only I can do.

347
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,291
[ALEXIS]
As for that pathetic Anti.

348
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,625
Allow me to discipline him.

349
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:05,500
[AKANE] Please. And don't
let anyone in this room.

350
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:08,083
You met an alien life form?!

351
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,458
And Akane was there too?

352
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,666
[YUTA]
That's right.

353
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,833
No way, you mean that
she's with an alien?

354
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:17,875
Don't forget the city in the sky
hanging over us like a ceiling.

355
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:20,000
How's all this tie together?

356
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:23,750
So we're dealing with a god,
aliens, and a floating city.

357
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,791
This is, like, way too
for me much to handle.

358
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,250
[GRIDMAN] Then the source of
the approaching danger,

359
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:33,750
may be Akane Shinjo
and this Alexis Kerib.

360
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,750
[YUTA] If Kaiju are born
from Shinjo's heart,

361
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,875
then fighting isn't
my only mission.

362
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:44,916
For us and Gridman, there is
even more that we must do.

363
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,208
[ALEXIS]
Anti, a moment of your time?

364
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:59,625
You did so well out there today,
I have a reward for you.

365
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:00,666
[ANTI grunts]

366
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:10,125
[ANTI yells]

367
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,916
[ALEXIS chuckles]
