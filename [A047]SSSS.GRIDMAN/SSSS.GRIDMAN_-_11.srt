Hypovolemic shock maybe?

Though, the doctor was saying
it's absurd for that to cause

[VIT] Up until now, Junk only

[BORR] If Junk and Yuta

That's why we had
you come with us.

Because you are me.

I don't need any other reason
to be born than that.

[RIKKA] What do you
think of me, Akane?

00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,666
[ALEXIS] Sorry to end
this pointless chat,

347
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,541
but I must interrupt.

It's the alien.

00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,833
[ALEXIS] Hurry it up, Akane.
You're needed after all.

00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:58,083
[AKANE] I told you,
I can't make kaiju anymore.

351
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,833
[ALEXIS] Unfortunately, I think
you misunderstand me.

352
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm fine with you becoming
a kaiju yourself.
