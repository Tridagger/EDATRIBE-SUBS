1
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Chi.

2
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:22,466
Chi.

3
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,433
Oh, are you up, Chi?

4
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,466
Chi.

5
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,966
This room really gets
bright in the mornings.

6
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,666
I've been thinking,

7
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,400
maybe I should buy some
curtains to shut out the light.

8
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,200
Good morning, Hideki.

9
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,566
That's great!

10
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,000
You've got all the
greetings down, Chi!

11
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,266
Chi remembers
lots of other things.

12
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,266
Things that Hideki taught me.

13
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,733
Electric light.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,466
That's right.

15
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:58,566
Television.

16
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:00,000
Correct!

17
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:01,066
Yummies.

18
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,933
Absolutely!

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,733
More yummies.

20
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,766
Yeah. Well...

21
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,700
In a way I guess
you're right, uh...

22
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:11,666
Not yummies?

23
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,266
Well, it's not
that you're wrong...

24
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,233
Hm? What's the matter, Chi?

25
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,833
You really don't seem
like yourself today.

26
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,833
Aren't you feeling well?

27
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,266
Feeling well?

28
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:31,000
"Feeling well" is not
something Chi has learned yet.

29
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:31,933
Let's see.

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,466
It could mean that
your head sorta hurts,

31
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,400
or your stomach's upset,

32
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,200
or you've got
pains in your chest.

33
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,933
Head?

34
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,633
It doesn't look like it.

35
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,466
Stomach?

36
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,866
You're fine.

37
00:03:46,366 --> 00:03:47,166
Chest?

38
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,100
No, you're just fine.
I can see that!

39
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,600
Hey, Motosuwa!

40
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,900
I've got an appointment today,
so I'm going in early!

41
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm going in early!

42
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,533
I wonder what's up
with Shinbo today.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,133
Aw, where's my head?

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,733
I should've asked Shinbo
about you just now, Chi.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,133
I'm so dumb.

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,366
I guess I'll ask
him later at school.

47
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:10,000
Ah! I better hurry,
or I'm gonna be late!

48
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,433
I gotta go now, Chi.

49
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,733
I'm afraid it's time for me
to head out to school myself.

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,066
I'll talk to Shinbo about you,

51
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:32,866
and be right back after work.

52
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:36,100
Take care of yourself.

53
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:41,900
I'm gonna be late.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,266
I'll come back home
as soon as I can, okay?

55
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:51,233
Stay here,
and I'll see you later.

56
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,333
Chi.

57
00:04:57,266 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, what's this?

58
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,400
Oh no, "Final notice."

59
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,266
The phone bill and
the electric bill?

60
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,200
But I'm not getting
paid until this Friday!

61
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,000
Good morning, Mr. Motosuwa.

62
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,133
Oh, g'morning!

63
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,433
Uh--

64
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,866
Gotta go!

65
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,633
The Ashikaga shogunate
lost its power at that time.

66
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,933
So, with the
importation of firearms,

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,500
the Middle Ages of
Japan comes to an end,

68
00:05:27,566 --> 00:05:30,500
and Nobunaga takes his
place to open the doors

69
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,500
of the modern age in terms
of politics and economics.

70
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,666
Therefore, if you're going
to open the classroom door,

71
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:40,133
I'd also appreciate it if you
would close it, Mr. Motosuwa.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,066
Ab-absolutely! Good morning!

73
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,566
Rather than waiting,
we started without you.

74
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:48,833
Yes. I'm late. I'm sorry.

75
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,366
Ten laps around the track!

76
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,133
Huh?

77
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
Go on!

78
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:53,533
Right!

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,233
Hey, I was kidding.
It's just a joke.

80
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,766
Eh?

81
00:05:57,833 --> 00:06:00,133
Do you really mean it?

82
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,433
Do you see a running track
anywhere in this building?

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,633
Uh.

84
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,366
But because you
played along so well...

85
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,033
Hm?! Oh.

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,133
I'm gonna let you off
the hook this time.

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,666
Now, you better take your seat.

88
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:15,866
I'm going to call on you a lot!

89
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:16,933
Huh?

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,333
But I thought you were
gonna let me off the hook?

91
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,733
You were even later than usual.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,566
Are you having another
problem of some sort?

93
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:27,800
That's right.

94
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:31,133
I really want your opinion on
something a little later on.

95
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,900
Mr. Motosuwa, page
forty-three of the textbook.

96
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,466
Uh, right!

97
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,033
Your Persocom's acting strange?

98
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,033
Sorta.

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,766
I haven't really
had any problems

100
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,800
with her up 'til now,
but this morning it seemed

101
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,233
like she wasn't responding
to much of anything.

102
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,433
She seemed lethargic,

103
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,466
almost like you feel
when you catch a cold.

104
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,966
Uh, I don't get it.

105
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,400
So what do you think
I'm doing wrong now?

106
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,900
Are you re-charging her?

107
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,933
Huh?

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,966
You're not
charging her, are you?

109
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:18,500
What do you mean charging her?

110
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:19,900
Shouldn't she charge herself?

111
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,100
You know, we are talking about
electrical appliances here!

112
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,700
Do you think they'd
just go out somewhere

113
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:25,800
and soak up some voltage

114
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:27,600
without consent of the owner?!

115
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,133
Well I guess that's true.

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,400
That "girl" is just a Persocom!

117
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:32,733
Right. Yeah.

118
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,400
Okay, first thing,
you don't take it

119
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,133
outside much, do you?

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,933
Well, I'm busy with
work every afternoon.

121
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,233
And I'm not sure if I want Chi

122
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,433
to be walking around by herself.

123
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,766
It was a huge mess just to
get her some underpants.

124
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,233
Hey, Sumomo.
It's time for a lesson.

125
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,333
Can you please tell Motosuwa

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,300
how to recharge a
Persocom's batteries.

127
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,966
Yes, sir! Request understood.

128
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,466
Persocoms use their
onboard solar arrays

129
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,400
to partially recharge
their batteries merely

130
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:04,233
by taking them
outside into the sunlight.

131
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
The power to perform
most everyday chores

132
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:08,200
can be achieved by
self-generating energy

133
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:10,033
using this method.

134
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,500
However, if conditions
prevent a Persocom

135
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:16,200
from utilizing direct sunlight
for a long period of time...

136
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,300
...the alternative method is
by using this charging cord!

137
00:08:21,366 --> 00:08:24,100
In most cases this cord
is conveniently located

138
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:25,833
somewhere in the head region.

139
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,200
I see! That thing in her ear...

140
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:31,133
I'll bet anything you don't
have a power adapter, either...

141
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Well no. Not really.

142
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:34,933
Okay, how many amps you use?

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,433
I don't know.

144
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,100
Now be careful.

145
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,666
If you do a complete
quick-charge

146
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:42,000
to full capacity,
it'll be a big pull.

147
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,100
I fixed my place up so
it's all right, but...

148
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,200
Now where...
Oh, here it is. Here y'go.

149
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:50,233
Just try charging her up,

150
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,766
and if she still
doesn't seem right,

151
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,166
I'll take a look at her.

152
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,733
This is great. You saved me!

153
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Thanks, Shinbo.

154
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:09,800
Mmm. What to do
about work today...

155
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:12,666
I'm really worried
about Chi's condition.

156
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,266
I wonder if I could manage
to take the day off.

157
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,066
Motosuwa Senpai!

158
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,200
Uh?

159
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,133
I finally caught up with you!

160
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,166
Boy, I'm glad I didn't
let you get away.

161
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,766
I ran all the way to catch you!

162
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,733
Yumi!

163
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,466
You're, uh, working
today, aren't you?

164
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,466
Later this afternoon?

165
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,633
Oh, yeah...

166
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,100
About my work
schedule today- Oh!

167
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,533
Wow!

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,133
This is the first time I've seen
Yumi in her school uniform.

169
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,166
Senpai?

170
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,433
Huh?

171
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,400
Is this really the first time
you've seen my school uniform?

172
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:46,000
Aggh! Not again!
Was I talking out loud?

173
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,100
So what do you think of it?

174
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,566
Our uniform's pretty popular!

175
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,000
Um. So then.

176
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,866
Getting back to the subject
of today's schedule.

177
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,866
Oh yeah, right,
today's schedule.

178
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, one of our other
employees can't make it today,

179
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:04,533
so instead of my regular shift,
I have to go in early.

180
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
Everyone else needs to pitch in!

181
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:07,933
Um, yeah.

182
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I was supposed to have
my club meeting today, too.

183
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,366
Our pub works
really hard, doesn't it?

184
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:17,066
C'mon, Senpai,
let's go and complain.

185
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,266
I can't do it.

186
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,733
I just can't skip work today.

187
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:25,266
Good afternoon, welcome.

188
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,966
Have a seat anywhere.

189
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:30,033
Yumi, two drafts for
counter number seven!

190
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,733
My pleasure!

191
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll take these plates.

192
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,866
Two drafts, coming up!

193
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,466
Wow, it was really busy today.

194
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:13,533
Thanks for all the
hard work, Senpai!

195
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,566
Same to you, Yumi. See ya!

196
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,333
Bu- Sure. G'nite.

197
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,933
Chi, I'm back home.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,233
Chi!

199
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,066
Chi! Are you all right?! Chi!

200
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,200
Hideki.

201
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,700
I'm really sorry, Chi.

202
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:49,600
But there's nothing
to worry about.

203
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,833
I'll get you
charged up right away!

204
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Okay then,
I've got it all set up!

205
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:58,466
Here we go, Chi!

206
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,900
Aagghhhh!!

207
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,666
Huh?

208
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,666
Eh? Eh?

209
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,133
Huh!

210
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,500
What? What is it?
What's going on?

211
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:25,066
What in the world
is going on here?!

212
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:28,433
It's not... a blackout.

213
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,933
Is it really just
because of this?

214
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,366
Hideki.

215
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:38,266
Hideki, welcome home.

216
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,133
Chi.

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,700
Chi, are you alright?

218
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:47,000
Is Chi alright?

219
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,533
Calm down now. Think, think!

220
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,533
Now be careful.

221
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,900
If you do a complete
quick-charge

222
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,333
to full capacity,
it'll be a big pull.

223
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,266
That's it!

224
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,366
I just blew the circuit breaker!

225
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:04,966
Just a minute, I'll have you
back to normal right away.

226
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,633
Wait a sec!

227
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,000
Why aren't the
lights coming back on?

228
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,166
Isn't flipping this
thing is supposed

229
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:14,933
to bring back the power!

230
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,666
I guess it really is broken!

231
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,900
Shinbo!
Are you sleeping?! Shinbo!

232
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,900
Oh no, he's not back
from school yet...

233
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,533
Miss Hibiya! It's Motosuwa!

234
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,033
I'm really sorry it's
so late! Miss Hibiya?

235
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,466
Of course, she would be gone
now as well, wouldn't she?

236
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:38,300
I've got to reach someone.

237
00:13:38,366 --> 00:13:41,000
If Shinbo's not around,
maybe Kokubunji...

238
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,666
Uh?

239
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:52,500
No! It can't be out of order!

240
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh no! The final due
date for the phone bill

241
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:55,866
was supposed to be today!

242
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,233
Which could also mean

243
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,133
that the due date for
the electric bill was-

244
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Just as I thought.

245
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,066
But what I need now is a phone!

246
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,533
Was there a pay
phone around here?

247
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,366
This... is all I've got.

248
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,000
Wal-let.

249
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,733
Hm?

250
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,933
This is a wallet.

251
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,566
This is bag.

252
00:14:21,633 --> 00:14:26,200
Is it correct?

253
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,366
Yeah. It's correct.

254
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,666
Good girl, Chi.

255
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,733
Chi has learned many things.

256
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,900
Hideki has taught
many things to Chi.

257
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:45,233
It's all right. Just rest.
You don't have to talk.

258
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,166
It'll be all right. I'll do
something about this.

259
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,833
I'll make sure
I do something about it.

260
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,366
So you don't have to
talk anymore, okay?

261
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:05,900
"My Pleasure"
is open until 2:00am.

262
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:08,066
Someone must still be there.

263
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,766
Huh?!

264
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,700
Chi?

265
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,166
I-It's nothing.

266
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,533
Hold on, Chi,
you just hold on tight!

267
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:24,766
Chi.

268
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,766
All right, here we go!

269
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,833
Chi is heavy?

270
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,366
Oh no, you're lighter than
when I first picked you up.

271
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:52,133
It'll be faster if
I cut through there.

272
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,800
Under construction?!

273
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,566
No way! I don't
have time to think!

274
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,766
Let's see... Which way?

275
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:21,400
All right... So we're here.

276
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:24,500
Turn left when we
get to that mailbox.

277
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,166
It looks like we've
got a little detour.

278
00:16:42,633 --> 00:16:44,066
That's the building!

279
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,500
Hey, we did it, Chi!

280
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,633
"My Pleasure" is right
near that building!

281
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,633
There's no time
to walk around it.

282
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,666
Chi.

283
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,933
It's just on the
other side of that.

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Do you think you
can make it, Chi?

285
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:21,633
Yes, Chi can make it.

286
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,433
We made it! Chi, we made it!

287
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,733
Unh...

288
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,833
Hideki.

289
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,933
Chi, are you all-

290
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:41,600
Hey, Chi... Talk to me!

291
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:46,633
Chi! Are you alright?
Chi, hang in there!

292
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,500
Chi what's wrong?

293
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:52,833
Chi... Chi!

294
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,700
Wait just a minute;
I'm gonna get you there!

295
00:18:59,233 --> 00:19:01,333
Dammit, she's
getting heavy again!

296
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:05,733
Mr. Motosuwa?

297
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,833
M-Miss Hibiya?!

298
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,100
Yes.

299
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,533
Uh, bu- umm... How did you-?

300
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,566
Well, while I was
looking out the window,

301
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,733
I saw someone tumbling down.

302
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,666
So I asked him to stop.

303
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,133
The window?

304
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,300
Yes, from the taxi cab window.

305
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:27,933
Were you heading home?

306
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,933
I'd actually hoped to get
home much earlier than this,

307
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but there were simply too
many errands I had to run.

308
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,966
Well, you really saved me.

309
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,233
I don't know what
I would've done

310
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,700
if you hadn't passed by,
Miss Hibiya.

311
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:41,933
Oh, now, please don't overreact.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,566
I'm not overreacting. I mean it.

313
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:47,933
In fact, you're the one who
saved both of us, Miss Hibiya.

314
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,766
All I did was run around
and put us in danger.

315
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,300
Hideki.

316
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,800
Chi.

317
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:59,466
Are you all right, Chi?

318
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,933
Hideki.

319
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,066
Oh thank goodness.

320
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,933
You should be
all right now, Chi.

321
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,800
When you feel better,

322
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,866
you can say thank you
to Miss Hibiya.

323
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:11,933
Warm.

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,733
Hideki is warm. Very warm.

325
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,000
Chi is happy.

326
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,433
Chi.

327
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:46,100
Oops!

328
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,733
You're a lifesaver.

329
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,100
I'll pay for the electricity
I'm using right now.

330
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:55,266
Oh, don't worry
about it, please.

331
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,300
I won't have it any other way.

332
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,333
I can't just expect you
to fix every single thing

333
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
that goes wrong in
my life, you know!

334
00:21:01,466 --> 00:21:02,933
Well, now, really.

335
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,733
I don't think I did all that-

336
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:05,966
Hm?!

337
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:06,900
Hey there!

338
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,100
Shinbo.

339
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,100
Mr. Shinbo, welcome home.

340
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,666
Motosuwa, hey man,
what are you guys doing?

341
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:15,166
I'm, recharging Chi.

342
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,666
Recharging?

343
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,366
Yow! Oh man, that's fast!

344
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:20,833
Hey Motosuwa!

345
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,833
The electric meter is going
around at an amazing speed!

346
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,266
An amazing speed?

347
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,633
At this rate, you're gonna
have to get another job!

348
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,566
Really?!

349
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:30,733
Do Persocoms always
use that much power?

350
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,100
Well, I've never seen anything

351
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,266
like this with a
Persocom before.

352
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm really sorry.

353
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:40,633
I promise to pay you
back for every single watt.

354
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,233
But do you think you can wait
until the end of the month?

355
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,333
Don't worry about it,
the electricity's no problem.

356
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,666
But aside from that,
I've been meaning

357
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,300
to have a conversation with you

358
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:50,966
about the rent for this month.

359
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:51,933
Gah!

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,100
The rent! No! Did I- 

361
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,466
Well, I haven't
received your check yet.

362
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:58,266
Okay.

363
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,466
I promise I'll bring
you the rent

364
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,833
just as soon as I get
paid at the restaurant.

365
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,100
Please forgive me!

366
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,266
Chi?

367
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,066
I'll make sure to have
it for you by Friday!

368
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:10,200
Even if I have
to work myself to death,

369
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:11,800
I'll make sure I have the money!

370
00:22:11,866 --> 00:22:13,933
Oh, please don't worry
about it so much!

371
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,233
I don't mind when you pay it,
just as long as you do pay it.

372
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,466
I can't do that!

373
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,166
I promise you,
I'll bring you the rent

374
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,300
and the electricity
money by Friday.

375
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,866
Really, don't worry
about it so much!

376
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,000
Chi?

377
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,000
You know, most
people seem to have

378
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,633
a pretty hard time
losing weight,

379
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,266
but somehow you never
seem to get any fatter.

380
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,533
I got paid the other day,

381
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,233
and I thought I'd finally
gotten you back to average size,

382
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,900
but you just withered away
in less than an instant!

383
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,900
I mean, I'm doing my best here,

384
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,466
so can you at least
try not to get so thin?

385
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:24,433
Hideki. Who are you talking to?

386
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,766
My wallet.

387
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,100
The next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Works."

388
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,666
It's really hard to
make money, isn't it?
