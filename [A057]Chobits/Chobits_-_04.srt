1
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,666
Omigod, look,
he's out there again!

2
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,966
Every day for
the past two weeks!

3
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,900
He just stands out there
panting! It's frightening.

4
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:13,866
Mommy, why is the
man breathing like that?

5
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,400
Shhh! Don't look at him!

6
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,700
All right!

7
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,900
Today's the day
I finally go in there!

8
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,900
I just can't do it!

9
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,033
Why can't I just say
"Can I have some underwear?"

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,300
I couldn't buy them
again today, after all.

11
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:00,966
What am I doing?

12
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,666
I'm home.

13
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,133
Ah! What are you doing
in that kind of pose, Chi?

14
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,866
Hideki.

15
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,466
Welcome home.

16
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,766
Yes, I'm home, Chi.

17
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,566
Well, it looks like you've
remembered my name now.

18
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,766
"Hideki" is Hideki's name.

19
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,733
Chi can remember.

20
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,333
Great job, Chi.

21
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,033
You're really talking
well now, aren't ya?

22
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,633
But, uh, well, why were
you getting undressed?

23
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,533
That.

24
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,166
Huh?

25
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,100
The manager brought.

26
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:43,533
I see, so you were trying
to change into that, huh?

27
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,800
I'll have to go and
say thank you later.

28
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,100
But the problem right now

29
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:49,333
is we've got to get
you some underwear.

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,533
Asking for a dress or
a blouse is one thing,

31
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,300
but I don't know
about underwear.

32
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:55,733
"Miss Hibiya, do you mind

33
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,900
if we borrow your underpants?"

34
00:03:57,966 --> 00:03:59,733
Ah! I couldn't ask her

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,833
for something like underpants!

36
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
She'd think I was
a complete pervert

37
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,600
without a doubt!

38
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,733
Pervert?

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,733
So it's underpants you're
interested in, eh, Hideki?

40
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,166
Shinbo, couldn't ya
make an effort to knock?!

41
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,533
I did, but you were too busy

42
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,333
yelling "underpants" to hear me!

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
Oh man, don't tell me

44
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,200
I was saying that out loud?

45
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:18,400
Shouting's more like it.

46
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:20,700
So what you're saying is you're

47
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:22,866
too embarrassed
to buy underpants.

48
00:04:22,933 --> 00:04:24,300
Well I get this strange
feeling every time

49
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,566
I get near the lingerie store.

50
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,033
It's a feeling that
men aren't welcome,

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,833
and when I even get
within 20 feet of it- Oh!

52
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,466
It's just no good.

53
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,933
I've really got to
do something about this,

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
and I've gotta do it soon.

55
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay then, how about
if you just let Chi go out

56
00:04:39,066 --> 00:04:40,766
and buy some for herself?

57
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,133
Huh?

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,466
There's no way I can let
Chi go out all by herself!

59
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,633
She doesn't know
her way around town!

60
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,333
Hey, don't sweat it, buddy.

61
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,366
I can just let
you borrow Sumomo.

62
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:52,500
Huh?

63
00:04:52,566 --> 00:04:53,533
Aye!

64
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,566
She's got GPS navigational
software installed.

65
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,333
You just give her a destination,

66
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,500
and she'll map out the route.

67
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,600
Sumomo can handle all that?!

68
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,933
That's so awesome!

69
00:05:05,233 --> 00:05:06,566
Chi?

70
00:05:06,633 --> 00:05:08,366
Would you like to go shopping?

71
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,700
Go shopping?

72
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:14,233
Yeah. So you can
get some underpants.

73
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,000
Underpants?

74
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,633
All right, Chi. Look.

75
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,533
This.

76
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,466
You're going to go
find this and buy it.

77
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,600
Bait?

78
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:39,500
Ah! No, Chi, you are
not going to go buy bait.

79
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,666
Look!

80
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,533
What I'm talking about is
what this person is wearing!

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,266
This, or this, or this!

82
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:50,666
Understand?
These are underpants.

83
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,533
Underpants.

84
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Hideki wants this?

85
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:58,366
Yeah, this is exactly
what I want, Chi!

86
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:00,533
Do you think you
can remember it?

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,633
Chi can remember.

88
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,433
Gah!

89
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,933
Good morning!

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
According to schedule,
it's time for wakie exercises!

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,766
And we finish off
with a deep breath!

92
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,400
All right, well done!

93
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:35,366
Uh?

94
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,733
What was all that?!

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,066
Oh, scary!

96
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,600
I can't believe that
Shinbo actually gets up

97
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,400
to this every single morning.

98
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:44,600
In any case, Sumomo,

99
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,666
today you take
care of Chi, alright?

100
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,300
Of course!

101
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,700
Take care of yourself.

102
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,066
No, see today, I say
"take care of yourself",

103
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:56,233
you say "I'll be going now."

104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,900
I'll be going now.

105
00:06:57,966 --> 00:06:59,033
That's right.

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't take any dark alleyways.

107
00:07:00,866 --> 00:07:02,266
Always keep your eyes open,

108
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,466
and make sure you
never follow strangers!

109
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,600
And remember to look both ways

110
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,000
before you cross the street!

111
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:11,900
Dark alleyways. Follow
strangers. Cross street.

112
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,833
Alright then, now one last time.

113
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,700
Tell me what are you going to
be saying to the salesclerk?

114
00:07:16,766 --> 00:07:19,033
"Underpants thank you please."

115
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,133
That's right!

116
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,566
And you give the
clerk money your money

117
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,666
for the underpants?

118
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,066
Do you understand?

119
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:27,066
Chi understands.
I'll be going now.

120
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,700
I hope she'll be okay.

121
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,966
Huh? Oh my, are you going out

122
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,533
somewhere all by
yourself today, Chi?

123
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,933
Chi is going
shopping with Sumomo.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Well isn't that just wonderful!

125
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,533
Please do be careful, though.

126
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,633
I'll be going now.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,133
Initiating navigational program!

128
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,933
Turn left then go straight!

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,033
Wave those arms and legs,

130
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,866
and let's be
cheerful on our way!

131
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:23,066
Underpants,
underpants, underpants.

132
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:24,700
Underpants...

133
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:28,000
Prepare to turn right
at next corner! Turn!

134
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:38,433
Underpants,
underpants, underpants...

135
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,100
Hey, Hideki, are you
worried about something?

136
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,233
Yeah. I wonder if she's
doing everything right.

137
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,633
Right about what?

138
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,633
Well the underpants, of course.

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,033
Underpants?

140
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,833
Yeah, underpants. Underpants!

141
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,200
Huh??!

142
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,733
Umm, it's great
weather today, huh?

143
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,666
Yeah, nice days like
this really make me

144
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,200
wanna go outside and
have some fun, too!

145
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,133
Isn't that true?

146
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,766
I was just thinking
the same thing!

147
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,266
The problem's on page 15.

148
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,300
Right.

149
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:20,366
Underpants, underpants,
underpants.

150
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,166
Make a left turn now!

151
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,033
We must stop here for a moment,

152
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,233
as we prepare
to cross the street!

153
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,433
Bicycle.

154
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,566
Ding-dong! That's right!
You're correct!

155
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,333
Traffic light.

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,766
Ding-dong! Correct again!

157
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:38,700
Crosswalk.

158
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:42,533
Ding-dong-ding-dong!
Absolutely correct!

159
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,700
Chi.

160
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:48,666
Underpants.

161
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,533
The light is green!

162
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,033
Let's raise our arm
as we cross the street!

163
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:54,500
Warning! Warning!

164
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,266
You have strayed
from the correct route.

165
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,200
Please return to
the original path!

166
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,000
Can it be, that Chi...?

167
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,666
What is it?

168
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,033
I've got a bad feeling
about things. Uh?

169
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,733
Since you're up,
you can start on page 21.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,133
Right.

171
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,000
Underpants.

172
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:26,833
Warning, warning!
This is not a lingerie store!

173
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,600
But this is what
Hideki showed Chi.

174
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,666
This is only advertising!

175
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:33,800
This is not where you buy it!

176
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,933
Chi can't buy underpants here?

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,366
Aye!

178
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,000
Now, let's get back
onto the proper route.

179
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,466
Please turn around!

180
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
Underpants.

181
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,133
Ding-dong! You are correct!

182
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,566
Man, I hate this wind.

183
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,733
Hm?

184
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,700
Underpants.

185
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,100
Huh?

186
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,566
Underpants, thank you please.

187
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,700
What are you doing?!

188
00:11:04,766 --> 00:11:06,633
Warning, warning, warning!

189
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,866
This is not a
lingerie store, either!

190
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,466
But, underpants...

191
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,633
You are unable to
buy underpants here.

192
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,633
Please go back exactly
forty feet and turn left!

193
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,833
Underpants.

194
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,900
What's up with that?
Weird Persocom.

195
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,166
I'm so worried about Chi.

196
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:28,533
Was she able to buy
the underpants or not?

197
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,300
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants!

198
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,966
Oh, I knew I should
have gone with her!

199
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:38,166
For now, why don't
you just try staying here

200
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,300
with us on page 23.

201
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,733
Right.

202
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,933
Chi.

203
00:11:53,133 --> 00:11:57,366
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants,

204
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:01,200
underpants, underpants,
underpants...

205
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:04,866
Please proceed
straight another 100 feet!

206
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,300
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants,

207
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:12,733
underpants,
underpants, underpants,

208
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,666
underpants, underpants.

209
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,466
Stop now! All traffic halt!

210
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,166
Kitty.

211
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,000
Ding-dong! You are correct!

212
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,000
We must wait until they're
done crossing the street!

213
00:12:30,766 --> 00:12:32,466
Underpants?

214
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,066
Underpants.

215
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:39,100
Warning, warning! This is
not the correct route!

216
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:42,800
Warning, warning!

217
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:45,066
Please return to the
original route at once!

218
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:56,766
Chi.

219
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:01,266
Chi.

220
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,233
No, not underpants.

221
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,200
Chi? Sumomo?

222
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,033
Emergency! Emergency!

223
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,733
Persocom in
life-or-death crisis!

224
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:23,033
Chi! Where have you gone?

225
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,033
We have big trouble!

226
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,133
Chi is missing!
Emergency! Emergency!

227
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,233
Oh, there- 

228
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,366
Big trouble!

229
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,866
The situation is not
turning out as it should!

230
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,833
Sumomo is not a doggie chew-toy!

231
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,633
Chi.

232
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,300
Chi!

233
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,366
Please help Sumomo get free!

234
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,933
Chi.

235
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,200
Hey! Pesu, come on! Let's go!

236
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,000
That was a very close call.

237
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:01,933
Hey!

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,966
I already said
Sumomo is not a chew toy!

239
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,133
It looks like they're
not at the store.

240
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,033
Have they even arrived yet?

241
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:16,166
Why don't we eat
over at that fountain?

242
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,366
Um... Excuse me, please.

243
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:19,733
Have you seen a Persocom
with ears like this,

244
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
and a mobile unit
about this size,

245
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,500
trying to buy underpants?

246
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:24,666
Could this guy be the owner

247
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:26,633
of that Persocom
that acted so weird?

248
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,066
Huh? What? But I, uh-

249
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,233
Don't talk to him!

250
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,900
Who knows what he'll
have his Persocom do next!

251
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:33,700
Let's go!

252
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,700
Yeah!

253
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:36,066
Uh, what's the matter with them?

254
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,166
I wonder why they wouldn't
tell me anything.

255
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:42,133
Could it be that Chi did
something to them?

256
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,033
Guess who!

257
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,633
Oh! I'm so sorry!

258
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,533
Yumi, is that you?

259
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,700
I'm sorry about that.

260
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,700
I really just wanted
to have a little fun.

261
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you gonna
be alright, Senpai?

262
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,733
Whoa!

263
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,633
Omigod. Those breasts.
Her breasts.

264
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:00,966
Hmm? Motosuwa-senpai?

265
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,900
That feeling I just
had was really soft

266
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:04,000
and warm, you know?

267
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,500
It'd be pretty bad if
breasts were hard and cold.

268
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:08,900
Wah! No-no-no-no-no-no!!

269
00:15:08,966 --> 00:15:10,966
I was talking to
myself again, wasn't I?

270
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,466
Anyway, what are
you doing down here

271
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:14,066
in the marketplace, senpai?

272
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,900
Oh, that's right!
I was looking for Chi!

273
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry, Yumi,
I'll see you later, okay?

274
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,433
Uh, Senpai!

275
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,333
Chi, where did you
disappear to? Huh?

276
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Chi.

277
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Chi! Chi!

278
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:03,533
Hideki says to use the crosswalk
when crossing the street.

279
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,333
That's wonderful!

280
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,300
Look both ways, raise your arm
and cross the street.

281
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,033
Very good!

282
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,200
You remembered everything, Chi.

283
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:20,533
Ah!

284
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,066
You jerk!

285
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,733
What are you standing
in the street for?!

286
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,933
S-Sorry!

287
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:32,766
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants...

288
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,100
Aye! That's the correct route!

289
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,933
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants,

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,666
underpants, underpants...

291
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,000
Underpants. Bait for Hideki!

292
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,600
Gah!

293
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,966
Just what does she
think she's doing?

294
00:16:50,033 --> 00:16:52,266
Although, it's true it
can be considered bait.

295
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,500
Underpants!

296
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,466
Warning, warning!

297
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,000
That is only another
advertisement!

298
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,933
The store's over there.

299
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:04,300
Chi.

300
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,633
Underpants, underpants.

301
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,033
No wonder they're late!

302
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,266
They've must've been distracted

303
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,533
by every advertisement in town.

304
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,133
I hope they get to the
store while it's still open.

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,166
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants,

306
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:22,600
underpants, underpants.

307
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,800
Underpants!

308
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,633
Warning!

309
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,200
Underpants, underpants,
underpants, underpants.

310
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,066
Looks like they'll be all right.

311
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,733
You're almost at the store.
You can do it, Chi.

312
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,633
Underpants,
underpants, underpants,

313
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,900
underpants, underpants.

314
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,833
And stop!

315
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,600
Congratulations!

316
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:53,866
You have arrived
at the destination!

317
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,166
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding,
woo-woo, yay!

318
00:17:57,233 --> 00:17:58,766
We can buy underpants here?

319
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,466
Yes! You can! You can! You can!

320
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,100
You can! You can!

321
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,133
Oh yeah, Chi,
that's the way to go!

322
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,466
Now, the only thing you
have to do is tell

323
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,000
the clerk the phrase you
learned this morning.

324
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,366
Chi buys underpants.

325
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,900
Attention please!

326
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:23,400
Starting right now is our
Super Sale on lingerie!

327
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,200
Everything on the
cart is half price,

328
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:28,866
all underwear 50 percent
off! Come on in!

329
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,300
Chi!

330
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,366
Chi!

331
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,400
Oh! This is way too scary!

332
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,466
We must get out
of here, immediately!

333
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:40,700
Oh Chi, are you
alright in there?

334
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,366
If I help you,
everyone will see!

335
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,066
But I just gotta do it!

336
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:47,700
Chi! Are you okay?!

337
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,766
Chi!

338
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,266
Huh? Ah! Underpants!

339
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,266
Someone help!

340
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:00,400
Huh?!

341
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:01,466
It's the pervert, the one
who's been standing there

342
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:02,933
staring at the store
all day long every day!

343
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,566
I should have known
we should have tried

344
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:06,233
to keep an eye on that guy.

345
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,766
Look, it's a misunderstanding!

346
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,100
I can explain it!

347
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,733
Yeah, I just bet you can, pal.

348
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,666
Come on with us.

349
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Huh? No wait,
I haven't done anything!

350
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:18,400
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent, I can explain!

351
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,733
Chi.

352
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,166
Oh boy, that was very dangerous.

353
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,500
Chi?

354
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,733
Underpants. Gone.

355
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:42,666
Underpants.

356
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:44,166
Huh?

357
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,266
Underpants, thank you please.

358
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,633
Oh, what a terrible mess
that was back there.

359
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,866
Why did everybody treat me

360
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,300
like some kind of
pervert or something.

361
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,833
Poor Chi.

362
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,133
It had to be awful for her too.

363
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,533
I sure hope she
got home all right.

364
00:20:08,933 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm back.

365
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,833
Hideki, welcome home!

366
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,200
Chi! You made it back home.

367
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,100
I was so worried about you.

368
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,266
So!

369
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,033
Did you buy manage
to buy some underpants?

370
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,233
Chi.

371
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,766
Did you really get them?
Well, let's see.

372
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,533
This.

373
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,066
But those're men's underwear.

374
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:29,400
Wait a minute, Chi.

375
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:32,000
Did you say the words
I told you to say?

376
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,800
Chi told sales clerk:
"Underpants, thank you please,"

377
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,200
because Hideki says
"he wants this."

378
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:40,600
And, this is what they gave you?

379
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:45,500
Oh. Well, now I understand.

380
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:50,166
These underpants are no good?

381
00:20:57,533 --> 00:20:59,100
Thanks for trying, Chi

382
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,533
I know you did your best.

383
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Chi.

384
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:12,133
That means I have
to go back there.

385
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,033
Oh, Lord, please help me.

386
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,433
Chi?

387
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,133
All right! I'm going in!

388
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,833
Underpants, thank you please!

389
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,233
Hideki, welcome home.

390
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,000
Those clerks at the lingerie
store think I'm a real pervert!

391
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:55,966
They backed away from me like

392
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,400
I was going to attack
them or something!

393
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:00,733
It was even worse
than it was yesterday!

394
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,500
Chi.

395
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:05,466
And on top of that,
I just realized I could

396
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,600
have bought these at
the convenience store!

397
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,766
I'm such an idiot!

398
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,900
Because of these underpants,

399
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:14,100
because of underwear in general,
I'm now a total pervert!

400
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,733
Pervert?

401
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,600
Hideki is a pervert!

402
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:20,133
Huh?!

403
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,866
Pervert! Hideki is a pervert!

404
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:24,700
No, no, don't say that, Chi!

405
00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:26,766
Pervert, pervert!

406
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:29,600
Ah!

407
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,733
Chi, this is a bookstore.

408
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,500
Chi?

409
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:06,700
And this is a book.

410
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:10,733
Books are like data storage,
educational tools.

411
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,466
Books.

412
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,100
Yup. And this math book is much

413
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,733
too expensive for me to buy.

414
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,633
This study guide is also too
expensive for me to buy.

415
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,133
This dictionary? Forget it.

416
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,633
Chi understands.

417
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,366
Oh?

418
00:24:21,433 --> 00:24:22,933
Hideki is dirt poor!

419
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:28,233
Chobits, next episode:
"Chi Finds."

420
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,766
Dirt Poor!

421
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:29,366
Dirt Poor.

422
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:29,966
Dirt Poor!

423
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:30,600
Dirt Poor.

424
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,200
Dirt Poor!

425
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,233
Dirt Poor.
