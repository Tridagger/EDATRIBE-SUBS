1
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,800
The building is
300 meters ahead.

2
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,233
Your destination
is the 7th floor!

3
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,233
There it is!

4
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,333
W-What's that?

5
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,933
Chi!

6
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,166
Where's Chi?!
What did you do to her?

7
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,933
Hey! Darn it!

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,866
So, where the heck did she go?

9
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:08,933
Hey, look up there!

10
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,066
Do you see her?

11
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,166
Hey, look at that!

12
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,900
Chi! Where'd you go, Chi?!
Answer me!

13
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:30,800
Where did she go?

14
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,433
Huh?

15
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,733
Now how on earth could
a thing like that happen?

16
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:06,000
Yuzuki, replay at
1/4 speed for me!

17
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,366
Right.

18
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,133
Yuzuki!

19
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,466
Yuzuki!

20
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,966
Darn it. Where is she?

21
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,933
Sumomo, we've gotta get
a hold of Minoru right now!

22
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,333
Can you try calling him at home?

23
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,533
Huh? Hey, Sumomo.

24
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,500
What's wrong? Are you all right?

25
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:47,433
Sumomo! Sumomo!

26
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,066
No way, she can't be broken!

27
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,800
Say something, Sumomo!

28
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,100
Darn it.

29
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,700
And just when
I borrowed her, too.

30
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:55,433
Now what have I done?

31
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,233
This is the
north entrance police.

32
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,166
Huh?

33
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,566
All of you who've
stopped your Persocoms

34
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,366
in the courtyard in
front of the train station,

35
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:03,233
please move them immediately!

36
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,400
Once again,
your attention please.

37
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,266
This is the police
office located

38
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,433
inside the north entrance
of the train station.

39
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,466
All of you who've
stopped your Persocoms

40
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:14,233
in the courtyard in
front of the train station,

41
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,566
please move them immediately!

42
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,900
You are impeding
the flow of traffic.

43
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:20,800
Please get them
cleared away immediately.

44
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:24,200
Hey, what's going on?
Is ours working?

45
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:25,200
Naw, it's down.

46
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,700
Can't seem to
figure it out, either.

47
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,433
That isn't what
I wanted to hear.

48
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,666
This computer
isn't any good either.

49
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:31,800
It won't reboot.

50
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:34,766
I'd like to know just
what the hell's going on.

51
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,766
What's up? Did something happen?

52
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,600
So it's not moving
at all then, is it?

53
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,933
Uh, no.

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,433
I don't suppose you have any
idea how all of this happened?

55
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
Well just before,
when it was looking up

56
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:48,633
at the Persocom standing
on top of the clock,

57
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,466
it suddenly stopped moving.

58
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,466
Clock? Persocom?

59
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,966
Hmm? Well there isn't
anything like that around here.

60
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,400
Uh, yeah...

61
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:04,933
Chi, where are you?!

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,633
Come on, where are you? Chi!

63
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,066
Chi!

64
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,566
Chi!

65
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,133
Chi!

66
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,933
Chi, can you hear me?!

67
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,666
Chi!

68
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,866
Hideki?

69
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,033
What is it? Is there
something the matter?

70
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,766
Actually, that's
what I'd like to know.

71
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,966
Oh, that was scary!

72
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,333
What was scary?

73
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,133
Chi has been located!

74
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,866
I repeat: Chi has been located!

75
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,300
Sumomo.

76
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,000
Chi.

77
00:08:22,433 --> 00:08:24,466
Alright, I've gotta find
some way to get her home.

78
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:27,966
1, 2, 3.

79
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:29,966
I guess that's it then.

80
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,500
There's no other way.

81
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,266
Hey mister, is that a Persocom?

82
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah.

83
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,533
Looks like it froze
while you guys were out.

84
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,633
I suppose Persocoms
are rather useful,

85
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,033
but it looks like it cost you
this time, didn't it, Buddy?

86
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,233
I guess. Yeah

87
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,333
But, Chi is a very
valuable Persocom for me.

88
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,133
And so...

89
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:17,366
I don't know how, 

90
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:19,533
but that didn't
feel like a dream.

91
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,033
It felt like I was in
some kind of action movie.

92
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,066
That whole thing is
one big mystery to me.

93
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,766
And it all really happened, too.

94
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,600
Yet here she is,
sleeping so peacefully.

95
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,200
But, wait...

96
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:36,600
She looks like she's sleeping,

97
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,500
but that's not
really sleeping. Is it?

98
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,866
Come to think of it, she
hasn't moved a bit all night.

99
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:49,866
It's not like she'll
never move again, right?

100
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,366
Chi.

101
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:53,733
What would happen
if she never moved again?

102
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,566
Chi! Wake up, okay? Chi!

103
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,033
What if... she stayed
like this forever?

104
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,066
Chi! What's wrong with you, Chi?

105
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,733
Wake up!

106
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,300
Chi.

107
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,166
Hideki.

108
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,500
Chi!

109
00:10:12,566 --> 00:10:15,033
Hideki! Hideki! Hideki!

110
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,033
Hey!

111
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,566
Chi.

112
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:22,666
Chi.

113
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:24,233
I'm glad, Chi.

114
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,833
Lord Minoru,

115
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,766
Would you like some more tea?

116
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,566
Thanks, I could
certainly use some.

117
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:52,800
Miss Chi, I wonder
if she is alright now.

118
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,466
Mr. Shinbo sent me an
e-mail a little while ago.

119
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,866
They managed to
find her somehow,

120
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,333
and were able to bring her home.

121
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,733
Oh how fortunate.

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,900
I'm so glad it all worked out.

123
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:05,700
What I don't understand...

124
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,933
is what could make
every computer

125
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,900
in the area freeze up like
that all of a sudden.

126
00:11:10,966 --> 00:11:12,466
And, you don't
seem to understand

127
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:14,333
why it happened either.

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,300
Isn't that right, Yuzuki?

129
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:19,300
I do not.

130
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:20,366
However...

131
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:21,733
However?

132
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,233
Surely...

133
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,633
I think...

134
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,866
Yes, I'm sure I heard some
kind of voice in my head.

135
00:11:27,933 --> 00:11:28,900
Who was it?

136
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:30,466
I don't know.

137
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:34,933
Although...

138
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,200
That's right...

139
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,466
It seems to me that
it was very familiar,

140
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:53,966
as if the voice
of someone I know.

141
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,600
It seemed.

142
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,400
It was a job.

143
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,866
Oh yeah? I don't suppose
you'd care to repeat that?

144
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:03,666
Chi got a job yesterday.

145
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:06,133
I told you no, what's so
difficult to understand?

146
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,633
I said no working at
anything shady like that!

147
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Hideki said no,
don't do a shady job.

148
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,000
So, Chi didn't do a shady job.

149
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,300
Well as far as jobs go,

150
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:18,233
I'd have to say a peep
show is pretty shady.

151
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,566
Chi?

152
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,800
But the man told Chi,

153
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,633
"Oh yeah, it's a
really good job."

154
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,366
Oh! Those kinda guys'll
always say things like that!

155
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:31,033
He said Hideki would be
happy if Chi finds good job.

156
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,066
Huh?

157
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,233
And Hideki said that he wanted

158
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,933
to buy lots of
things with money.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah, you're right. I did.

160
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,733
I guess I must've
said some stupid things

161
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,266
that made you do that.

162
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,133
Ah...

163
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,900
Huh?

164
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,800
Did Chi make mistake?

165
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:49,766
Um.

166
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,400
Is Chi bad?

167
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:53,800
Well, no. Not bad.

168
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:55,200
Chi isn't bad or anything.

169
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:58,200
I didn't mean...
You're not bad at all.

170
00:12:58,266 --> 00:12:59,933
Is that true?

171
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,933
Yeah!

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,700
Oh, Chi.

173
00:13:05,866 --> 00:13:07,900
Don't think that, Chi.
You're not bad!

174
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:14,200
Chi does not want
Hideki to hate Chi.

175
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:16,066
Because Hideki is Chi's-

176
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,566
I really appreciate
what you're saying, but...

177
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,733
Um... look, Chi, I don't
want you to think you have

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,566
to go out of your way
to work or anything.

179
00:13:22,633 --> 00:13:23,566
But why?

180
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,100
Hideki told Chi that
would make him happy.

181
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,400
Mmm...

182
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:28,966
Okay, what do you
think about this?

183
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:31,800
If you really want to get a job,
I'll go help you find one.

184
00:13:31,866 --> 00:13:33,200
But until I find you something,

185
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:37,466
you'll have to stay
at home. How 'bout that?

186
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,733
Thank you, Hideki.

187
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,666
Chi's happy now.

188
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,833
No, not you.

189
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,566
After all, I'm the one
who should be saying thanks.

190
00:13:49,633 --> 00:13:51,300
I really mean it.
Thank you, Chi.

191
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:53,466
'Cause you did it all for me.

192
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,833
Chi.

193
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,333
You need to be careful here,

194
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
due to the fact that this
particular phrase uses "tamae."

195
00:13:58,866 --> 00:13:59,766
A part-time job...

196
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,766
one that isn't shady
or even questionable,

197
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,666
But that'll still
consider hiring Chi,

198
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,766
even though she's a little short
in the common sense department.

199
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,966
Hmm...

200
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:11,200
I wonder if it's even possible

201
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,566
to find a place that perfect.

202
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Please don't be
worried about last night.

203
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,233
I didn't take
offense or anything.

204
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah, well that's good,

205
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:23,300
but I was really looking forward
to your home-cooked meal, Yumi.

206
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,366
Anyway, as it turned out,

207
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,533
it was a good thing your
Persocom was all right.

208
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,900
Yeah, that's true.

209
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:30,500
But she still doesn't
understand what she did.

210
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,166
And I think she
just might be liable

211
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,633
to do something strange again,

212
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,966
if I don't manage
to find her a new job.

213
00:14:37,033 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh I see.

214
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,166
I bet that won't very easy.

215
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:43,366
Well, actually,
it was pretty tough,

216
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,766
but I finally found one.

217
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,000
Huh?

218
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:47,933
A job for my Persocom.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,666
It's a bakery right
here in the mall.

220
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,466
I'm sure you must've
seen it at some point.

221
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,833
It's a place called Tirol.

222
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
And as luck would have it,

223
00:14:53,966 --> 00:14:55,466
they're having some kind
of festival at the moment,

224
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:58,033
which sounded like
just the thing to me.

225
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Anniversary...

226
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,233
Huh?

227
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,933
It's their 5th anniversary
festival, right?

228
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,266
It says it right here.

229
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:05,866
That's what the
flyer's all about.

230
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,666
Yeah, that's right!

231
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,266
So I talked to the owner
about it, he was very nice,

232
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,133
and he said he'd
be happy to hire Chi!

233
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,866
Man, I'm so relieved.

234
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,200
I was thinking I'd never
be able to find something.

235
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:20,766
That's so great.
You sure are lucky!

236
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,000
Okay, everybody,
time to open up.

237
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,033
My Pleasure!

238
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,733
Ready, Yumi?

239
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,933
Sure!

240
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:37,933
Come on in.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,733
Everyone's welcome to Tirol
Bakery's fifth anniversary fair.

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,400
Treat yourself
and join us inside.

243
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:47,933
Free gifts and prizes for
everyone who buys pastries.

244
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,166
Come on in.

245
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:53,266
Everyone's welcome to Tirol
Bakery's fifth anniversary fair.

246
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:57,000
We have gifts and
prizes for everyone...

247
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:57,733
Look at her! Isn't she cute?

248
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,333
Yeah, she is, isn't she?

249
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:04,333
Is that really a Persocom?

250
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, of course.
Take a look at the ears.

251
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,300
It's a dead give-away.

252
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,366
Oh wow, well,
she's still really cute!

253
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,866
So, is that a
Persocom out there?

254
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:11,966
Yep.

255
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:14,600
Wow, she's pretty cute, huh?

256
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:16,900
In the "saburai" used
in this example taken

257
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:20,466
from the Ise Stories, and the
"saburai" used in the example

258
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:22,766
taken from Taketori Stories,
we should note

259
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,633
that the following
words "te" and "ken"--

260
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,600
I wonder if she's
getting along okay,

261
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,666
and not causing
too much trouble.

262
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,233
Chi!

263
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,400
Thanks for all the hard work.

264
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,200
Chi.

265
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,166
It's almost closing
time, so finish up.

266
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,133
And thank you
very much for today.

267
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,966
Finish up?

268
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,033
Yes, Chi.

269
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,566
To "finish up" means your
job is done for the day,

270
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,000
and you can go home

271
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:50,133
Chi doesn't understand
what you say,

272
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,066
because this is first job.

273
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,533
Chi didn't make the
mistake, did she?

274
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,366
You didn't make any
mistakes at all, Chi.

275
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,233
In fact, your work
today was impeccable,

276
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,866
and I really appreciate
all the effort.

277
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,233
So Chi can get
money and go home?

278
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,766
Of course you can.

279
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,966
Here you go. This is for you.

280
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,900
Inside is your pay
for today's work.

281
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:13,666
Is this money?

282
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,766
No, that's only an envelope.

283
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,933
You'll find the money
inside when you open it up.

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,833
Can Chi buy something now...

285
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,233
with money inside?

286
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,833
Of course, that's what it's for!

287
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,366
Chis is now able to
buy things Hideki wants

288
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,100
with money inside envelope.

289
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,300
Chi has lots of things
not understood about.

290
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,833
So, must learn all about them.

291
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
Manager, Hiroyasu Ueda!

292
00:17:37,566 --> 00:17:40,066
Please teach Chi lots of things!

293
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:42,866
Hey, you know you really don't
have to use my entire name.

294
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:44,633
I think a simple
"Manager" is enough.

295
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,566
Manager!

296
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,466
That's right.

297
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,900
Manager! Chi calls
this person manager!

298
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:51,900
Chi remembered it.

299
00:17:51,966 --> 00:17:56,233
Yes, well I'd have to say Mr.
Motosuwa was right on the money.

300
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,966
Common sense would definitely
not be your strongest suit.

301
00:17:59,033 --> 00:18:00,633
Chi.

302
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,600
But there's no question
that you're a very good girl.

303
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,300
Chi is very good girl?

304
00:18:05,366 --> 00:18:06,333
That's right.

305
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
Just like what
Mr. Motosuwa said.

306
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:09,833
He said you were
a very good girl.

307
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Chi is very good girl.

308
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:14,433
That is what Hideki said.

309
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,133
Well, once again,

310
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,900
thanks for all the hard
work you put in today.

311
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:30,366
When Chi leaves,
is manager all alone?

312
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,000
Huh?

313
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:35,033
No other except
Chi is working here?

314
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,100
Well, since you brought it up,
there was someone else before.

315
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,133
A girl actually, but she...

316
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,500
Chi.

317
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:44,533
Well, nevermind that.

318
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,833
Nevermind?

319
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,033
Oh yeah, there's
just one more thing.

320
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,266
When we finish the
festival, do you think

321
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,533
you'd like to stay on and have
a regular job here at Tirol?

322
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,566
"Do you think you
might like to stay

323
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,133
and have regular job here?"

324
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:58,966
Really?

325
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,900
If you don't mind...

326
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:02,600
Please stay.

327
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:05,566
Chi will go ask
Hideki if it is all right.

328
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,600
Alright then.

329
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,866
So please see if you can come

330
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,033
every week if
he wouldn't... huh?

331
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,666
Thank you, manager!

332
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,800
Wah! Waaah! Ugh...

333
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:15,733
Manager, are you alright?

334
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,233
Yeah, I'll be fine, Chi,

335
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,100
but it's really not
good to do that.

336
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,400
What is not good?
Is job not good?

337
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,233
Not the job.

338
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,133
I meant hugging people,
that's what.

339
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,966
So it's bad to hug?

340
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,366
Well, it depends
on who, that's all.

341
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:31,733
Chi does not understand.

342
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,833
Who would be good to hug?

343
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,800
Um, who would? Well...

344
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:39,466
For instance,
someone you really like.

345
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:43,600
Someone...

346
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,533
...Chi likes...

347
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,233
If the one that is
meant for me should

348
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,033
one day happen to
fall in love with only me.

349
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
That will be the day

350
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,566
when I will have to
part with the one...

351
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,266
Hello there!

352
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,300
Huh?

353
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,333
Hey, what are you guys doing?

354
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,233
Is something wrong?

355
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,800
I believe this would
be your chaperone.

356
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,300
Hideki!

357
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,766
Chi passed pastries out!

358
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:13,133
Call manager "manager."
Invited people in.

359
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,500
Tirol is a bakery.
Good job. Work hard.

360
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:18,333
Hideki not as tall as Manager.

361
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
And Mr. Hiroyasu Ueda,
but call him "manager,"

362
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,800
said he wants Chi
to come back every week.

363
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:24,033
Hey! Hey! Hold on a sec!

364
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,000
Hideki! Hideki!

365
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,966
Okay, just talk
a little slower. Alright?

366
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,466
I see.

367
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:36,300
So he asked if you could
keep working there, huh?

368
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,333
Mm!

369
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,533
Well that's great,
good for you, Chi!

370
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,066
Mm. Hideki, can Chi work
more at job at bakery?

371
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:45,766
Well, of course, if you want to.

372
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,266
Here.

373
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,466
Uh.

374
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:03,266
So, with that...

375
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,066
Huh?

376
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:05,966
With that,

377
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,300
Hideki can buy all
the things he wants?

378
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,900
Oh, Chi.

379
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,300
No, this belongs to you, Chi.

380
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:26,133
Chi?

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,900
You worked very
hard for this money,

382
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:29,433
and it belongs to you.

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Hideki means he Hideki
doesn't need money anymore?

384
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, it's not like
I don't need it, but...

385
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,266
But?

386
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,466
You see,

387
00:21:39,533 --> 00:21:42,000
it's enough that you
wanted to do that for me

388
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,900
Thank you so much.

389
00:21:43,966 --> 00:21:47,800
Chi.

390
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:49,166
Go ahead and take it.

391
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:52,300
This is money you made yourself.
And you deserve it.

392
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:54,600
I want you to go out and
buy your favorite things.

393
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,633
What are Chi's favorite things?

394
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,766
Well that depends.

395
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,366
Whatever you want to have most.

396
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:02,033
Hideki...

397
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,233
Hm?

398
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,366
Is it okay if Chi hugs you?

399
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:10,466
W-What's the matter, asking
me that all of a sudden?

400
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:11,766
Is it okay?

401
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,866
Uh, sure.

402
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,933
Chi, I'm going to tell you
the rules of the bath house.

403
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,733
Are you ready?

404
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,933
Chi!

405
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,466
First, you pay the fee for
the bath with correct change!

406
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,133
Chi!

407
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,000
Second, you are not allowed

408
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,233
to put the towel
around your waist.

409
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,066
Chi!

410
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,200
Third, no matter
how hot the bath is,

411
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,566
you must not add cold water!

412
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:15,466
Chi!

413
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:16,833
Forth, put a towel
on top of your head

414
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,700
when you are in the bath tub!

415
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:18,933
Chi!

416
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,266
At finally, when you drink a
glass of milk after the bath,

417
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,733
your hand should
be on your waist!

418
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Me-me-me-me-me-

419
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,466
Chi!

420
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:28,466
The next episode of Chobits:
"Chi buys."

421
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,366
By the way, you can
only drink fruit milk

422
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,200
when you had something
good on that day.
