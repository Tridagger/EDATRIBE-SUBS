1
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,100
Hideki's special someone...

2
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:05,700
The one who is just for Hideki.

3
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,866
Chi?

4
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,300
But, if it isn't you, Chi...

5
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:17,900
If the same thing
happens this time,

6
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:20,466
we must do it.

7
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,533
We must do it.

8
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:40,533
You are...

9
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,766
Sorry to make you wait.

10
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,066
So, let's begin.

11
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,466
What does it mean? Begin what?

12
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,200
An analysis.

13
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,933
I'm going to analyze everything.

14
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,200
Where are you, Chi?

15
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,833
Telephone call
from Mr. Kokubunji!

16
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
From Minoru? Connect me, Sumomo.

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,633
Motosuwa, I just received
another interesting e-mail.

18
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,166
It's got a return
address that's identical

19
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,133
to the previous one that
had the image had on it.

20
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Sumomo has it now,

21
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,666
so go ahead and open
it as soon as you can.

22
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:29,366
It's from the same person?

23
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,533
Yes, but it's an entirely
different kind of image

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,666
from the last one.

25
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,766
I don't have the slightest
idea what to make of it.

26
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,766
Okay, but I have
to look for Chi.

27
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,666
I know, and I'm still trying
to find her on this end, too.

28
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,500
Please, just open it up.

29
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,100
It's possible there's a
clue in it that might help.

30
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,700
I guess it's worth a try.

31
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:49,533
Extracting from
the compressed file!

32
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,166
So, it's true.

33
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,933
The guy who sent the other image
was the one who abducted Chi.

34
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,366
Does it show Chi

35
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,000
in some horrible
predicament or something?

36
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:05,433
What is this?

37
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:15,866
All right.

38
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,333
You're now connected to
every Persocom in the house.

39
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,033
The cords look like
ribbons coming down.

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,300
It's really cute.

41
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,233
Ribbons?

42
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,666
Yeah. And they look
great on you, too.

43
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:31,466
I've never stopped
thinking about you.

44
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,700
I knew you had to be an
extraordinary Persocom

45
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:36,500
for "M" to post about
you on the message boards.

46
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,233
It's amazing, I didn't think

47
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,400
they'd let you walk
alone like that.

48
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,333
I thought I'd never
get to meet you.

49
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,633
But there you were:

50
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,000
a Persocom just like
the one "M" described,

51
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:48,566
right at the bookstore.

52
00:04:48,633 --> 00:04:50,166
I couldn't believe it.

53
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:53,733
It must be that your
owner doesn't have

54
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,700
any idea how valuable
you really are,

55
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:57,866
that's my guess.

56
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,233
The connection
terminals are normal,

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,966
as far as I can see.

58
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:05,666
All your special qualities
must be on the inside.

59
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,466
Chi is special?

60
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:10,433
Well, I would be
happy if you were.

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,366
So what is this thing?

62
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:14,700
It's not like the last photo;

63
00:05:14,766 --> 00:05:16,333
it doesn't look
anything like Chi.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,266
What am I missing?

65
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,833
Why would they send
something like this?

66
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,633
Sumomo, do you have any
idea what we're looking at?

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,633
This is...!

68
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,866
This is what?

69
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:29,966
This is known as
an attached image!

70
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:33,066
Thanks, even I know that!

71
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,733
Hey, don't expect so much!

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Sumomo is a mobile unit;

73
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,433
she can't answer abstract
questions or things like that.

74
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,266
Shinbo!

75
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,800
A very good evening to you!

76
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,166
Oh, hi Sumomo!

77
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,200
Been getting along
okay with Motosuwa?

78
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,600
Aye!

79
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,433
So what brings you
back all of a sudden?

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,700
Takako got pretty worried

81
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,800
when I started to tell
her about our phone call.

82
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:56,033
Motosuwa always gets so
serious about everything.

83
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,300
He must be terribly
worried about her.

84
00:05:58,366 --> 00:05:59,533
Yeah.

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,100
I'm sure he could use your help.

86
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,333
This is one of those times

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,700
when two rational heads are
better than one emotional one.

88
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,166
Miss Shimizu said that?

89
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,500
So what's the scoop?

90
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:10,933
You manage to find that
Persocom of yours yet?

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,866
No.

92
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,266
Well I'm sure you
must be worried

93
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,800
out of your mind by now.

94
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:19,633
I know that a Persocom's
memories can be erased.

95
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,600
Even so, I'll still remember.

96
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,900
Even if the other one's
not a living creature,

97
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:27,866
and even if she
doesn't remember,

98
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,900
I don't think it will
all be for nothing...

99
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,933
if I can remember.

100
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,800
I guess I am worried about Chi.

101
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm very worried.

102
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,966
That's why.

103
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,633
I want to find her
just as soon as I can.

104
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,033
All right.
And I'm here to help ya!

105
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,233
Thank you.

106
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:51,933
All right!

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,966
It's time to show me
everything you got.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,933
Interesting.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,266
So you're saying this
image has something

110
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,533
to do with your
Persocom disappearing?

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,166
I don't know, or at least,

112
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't make heads or
tails out of it, anyway.

113
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,933
Hmm.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,533
Might be a map, whatta ya think?

115
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,733
Huh?!

116
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,633
Yeah, I'm thinkin' it's a
map from a navigation system.

117
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,600
You know, like for
cars or cell phones.

118
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,000
But why would anyone want to
send us something like that?

119
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:34,300
Beats me.

120
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,133
Do you know where this place is?

121
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,566
We can always have
a Persocom look it up.

122
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:40,066
Can Sumomo do that?

123
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,333
Well, yeah, in a pinch,

124
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,533
but it's definitely
gonna take some time.

125
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,233
I know, let's ask Kokubunji.

126
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,966
It doesn't make sense.

127
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:52,266
Who in the world
would want to send me

128
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,300
a strange image like this one?

129
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:59,266
Same thing with this image
that was sent to me earlier.

130
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,366
But then, even if
I were to find out

131
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,066
who sent these images,

132
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:08,800
I couldn't do anything about it.

133
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:20,033
Because that was the
promise I made to you.

134
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,200
So now there's
really no other way,

135
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,233
except of course, to draw.

136
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,333
What Chi lost...

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,500
What Chi lost before
she became Chi...

138
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:36,566
What I'd like her
to find again someday.

139
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,400
To help her a little.

140
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,366
So she can finally find
"The One Just for Me."

141
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,533
Oh, I get it. It's a map.

142
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,566
Yeah, but we don't know where.

143
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,166
I'll look it up on this end.

144
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,500
Wait just a minute.

145
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,900
Yuzuki, use the LAN
with the other Persocoms

146
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,066
and match up the image with
the coordinates on a map.

147
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,933
We need to know where this is.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,266
Sure.

149
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,066
I'm afraid I'm at a
loss on this one too.

150
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,533
These images could have
been sent by anyone.

151
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
But I do think we're
on to something here,

152
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:20,233
and I think there's
a good chance

153
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,033
it'll lead us to Miss Chi.

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,133
So do you think
she's there, or...?

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,633
It would nice if she were.

156
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,000
Lord Minoru, we've
identified 12,568 locations

157
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:35,200
throughout Japan that
correspond to the map image.

158
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:38,833
12,568 locations?!

159
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,166
Well, ya gotta admit it is
rather abstract for a map.

160
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,100
How about Tokyo?

161
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,433
23 locations.

162
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,433
That's still way too many.

163
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,533
That's not too many;
we can check all those out!

164
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,733
Just a minute.

165
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,433
Yuzuki, if I'm not mistaken,

166
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
you still have the access log

167
00:09:52,766 --> 00:09:55,100
from the custom-made Persocom
site, isn't that right?

168
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:55,933
Yes.

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,633
Good.

170
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,866
Then I want you to track down

171
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,133
the access points
using those IPs.

172
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,166
What I want to know is

173
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,066
if any of those
access points correspond

174
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,300
with any of the 23 locations,
so see what you can find.

175
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,533
There is one match.

176
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,300
What's the user ID of the person
who uses that IP address?

177
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:14,800
Dragonfly.

178
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,300
So it's him?!

179
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,100
W-Who is it?

180
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,233
This guy--

181
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,833
He might, ya know...

182
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,200
Hey, what is all this?

183
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:26,166
Tell me who this "Dragonfly" is?

184
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:27,800
Mr. Motosuwa.

185
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:31,033
I think we just discovered
the location of Miss Chi.

186
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,233
Huh?

187
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,633
Amazing.

188
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,700
Something...

189
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,900
I can hear a voice in my head!

190
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,766
This voice...

191
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,666
It isn't my master's, and
it isn't Miss Chi's either.

192
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,566
Yet somehow
I recognize this voice.

193
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,033
Is it around here?

194
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,866
Yes.

195
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:53,233
The map coincides
with the address

196
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,200
of the IP right
where you're standing.

197
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,266
Wow, it didn't even
take us ten minutes

198
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,366
to walk here from our place.

199
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,466
So you mean I've been
that close to Chi all along?

200
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,433
Dragonfly loves
the custom models;

201
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,800
I think he's got over
twenty of them at least.

202
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,100
Over twenty?!

203
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,400
So that means,
we need to look for

204
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,166
a house that's big enough
to hold over 20 Persocoms.

205
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,566
But all the houses
around here are huge!

206
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:14,833
He went and hired a
private security company

207
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,666
to look after his
Persocoms, too,

208
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,200
if I remember correctly.

209
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:20,366
Hey, that's right;
he posted about that!

210
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:21,700
That's it: we gotta
look for a house

211
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:23,700
with a security
company logo on it!

212
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:25,300
Uh, right!

213
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:33,800
It's already more
than an hour now.

214
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,266
Every single Persocom
in the entire house,

215
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,766
and I still can't
hack the protection.

216
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,166
But, not for much longer.

217
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,533
The program we're running is one

218
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,633
I created especially for you.

219
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,300
No matter how
much you resist it,

220
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,066
it'll find a way to
eat right through you.

221
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,833
It's hopeless;
you'll have to accept it.

222
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:58,800
This isn't it!

223
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,700
But how do both of you
know so much about this guy?

224
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:05,433
Who is this Dragonfly
character, anyway?

225
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,666
Let's just say he's a
pretty conspicuous guy.

226
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,366
It's sorta hard
not to notice him.

227
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,633
Conspicuous?

228
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,366
Yeah, pretty snotty,
likes to provoke people.

229
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,433
Always arguing with
"M" all the time, too.

230
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,933
"M"?

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,533
My user name.

232
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
The name I use as an
alias whenever I'm posting

233
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,400
on a website; it's
basically a penname.

234
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:25,733
This isn't it, either! Darnnit!

235
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,533
Chi, wait for me!

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,533
I was right, you are
very special after all.

237
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,166
You really might be one
of the Chobits series.

238
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,400
Chi!

239
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,900
No!

240
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,500
That's it!

241
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:20,800
So she's in there?!

242
00:14:20,866 --> 00:14:22,100
There's another one over here.

243
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,500
Aw, come on!

244
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:25,200
Which is it?!

245
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,866
Shinbo, take Sumomo
for a moment

246
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,933
and go stand next
to the other house.

247
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,366
Sumomo!

248
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,833
Aye!

249
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,733
You're off the map,
so that can't be it.

250
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,266
This one!

251
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,800
I know you are
not the One for Me.

252
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,700
So don't try to come inside.

253
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,533
What's that?!

254
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:55,133
Chi!

255
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,866
Motosuwa! We can
get in over there!

256
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,933
Okay!

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Motosuwa! Shinbo!

258
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,433
That's strange, Sumomo
doesn't respond at all.

259
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,333
Is there something wrong
with the connection?

260
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
Yuzuki, can you try
to call them again?

261
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:11,200
Yuzuki?!

262
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,933
I hear a voice.

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,900
A voice?

264
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,233
A voice.

265
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,600
A voice of someone
who knows me very well.

266
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,600
The voice of the one
who knows me best.

267
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:26,833
Yuzuki!

268
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,133
Chi, I'm here! Are you okay?!

269
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,900
Hideki.

270
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,233
Chi.

271
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:51,700
Chi wants only one person.

272
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:56,633
Just the one person-
the One who is Just for Me.

273
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,833
And only the One Just for
Me can ever touch Chi.

274
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,666
Only the One Just for
Me can ever come inside...

275
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:11,900
Motosuwa!

276
00:16:11,966 --> 00:16:13,700
I don't know why, but
Sumomo's acting strange!

277
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:15,433
How's Chi?! Is she okay?!

278
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,100
Is it you, Chi?

279
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,333
Are you doing all of this?

280
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:24,133
Hideki, what is the
most precious thing

281
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,933
in the world to you?

282
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,533
The most precious thing?

283
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,233
The most precious thing...

284
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,966
For It... and for People.

285
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,966
If that can be figured out,

286
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:39,300
Chi might never have
to lose It again...

287
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,333
...the most precious thing.

288
00:16:48,066 --> 00:16:49,300
What's going on?!

289
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:52,433
Chi!

290
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:56,900
Aye?

291
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,166
Sumomo!
Hey, are you alright now?

292
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,333
My consciousness.

293
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,433
Yuzuki?!

294
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,366
Are you all right now Yuzuki?!

295
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:09,000
Lord Minoru.

296
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:16,733
Chi.

297
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:20,233
Hideki.

298
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,066
Hideki! Hideki! Hideki!

299
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,766
Chi, is it you?

300
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,833
Chi is Chi.

301
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,700
Hideki said Chi,
so Chi is Chi's name.

302
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:32,966
Hideki.

303
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:37,466
Chi, happy.

304
00:17:37,533 --> 00:17:39,900
Chi is happy Hideki came.

305
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,466
Chi.

306
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,366
Chi! Chi!

307
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:52,900
What's wrong?

308
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,266
I don't know what happened;

309
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,200
she just lost consciousness.

310
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:03,166
You must be the
guy called Dragonfly!

311
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:03,900
Uh?

312
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,200
N-No!

313
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:07,766
Hey, what did you do to Chi?!

314
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,100
I didn't do anything;
I just wanted to analyze her.

315
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,833
Shouldn't you at
least ask first?!

316
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,866
Um well she tagged
along with me.

317
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:15,800
Tagged along?!

318
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,100
Yeah, she just kinda
followed me home.

319
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,733
That's what it was.
You know how she is.

320
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,733
That's all.

321
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,733
Master, you said

322
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,833
before that you
had kidnapped her.

323
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,333
K-Kotoko!

324
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
The only thing I can
ever speak is the truth.

325
00:18:27,866 --> 00:18:31,166
Even if it works to your
disadvantage, Master.

326
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,200
And after all, you programmed
me to be like this.

327
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,300
Do you still have
any recordings of

328
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,700
when he said he kidnapped her

329
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:39,633
and brought her here?

330
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,600
Yes, I do.

331
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,900
Good!

332
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:44,233
Here, I want you to
come with us for a while!

333
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,666
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?!

334
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:46,800
Just try and stop me.

335
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:48,333
The proof of what
you did is in her,

336
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,100
and I'm gonna makes
sure it stays there.

337
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,566
This is so you don't
erase it when we leave.

338
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,966
That's right!

339
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,400
And just so you
don't start tryin'

340
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:56,766
to claim that we stole her,

341
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,600
tell Sumomo you're lending
her to us for a little while.

342
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,900
Go on; say it!

343
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,366
Well that was a
close one, all right.

344
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,933
Uh.

345
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,900
What?

346
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:12,266
Nothing.

347
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,500
Just that you were so
incredibly cute there,

348
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:16,966
Dita, that you almost
fell right off the ledge.

349
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:20,233
What kind of nonsense is that?

350
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,866
I'm only speaking the truth.

351
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:26,066
So anyway, have you found her?

352
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,566
Nope, not yet.

353
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,766
Geez, where could she be?

354
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm sorry, Dita.

355
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,233
I want to see
how things turn out

356
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
for just a little
while longer...

357
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Chi.

358
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:58,533
She hasn't woken up since.

359
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,733
I got her back home
as fast as I could.

360
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:06,100
Chi, she seemed so different.

361
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,233
And was that...

362
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,666
Was that actually
Chi doing that?

363
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,400
And what about that time before?

364
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:24,066
Was Chi responsible
for that too?

365
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,633
Then maybe she is...

366
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,366
Maybe Chi really is a chobits.

367
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:35,700
Hm?

368
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:37,533
Are you changing the password?

369
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
Enter the password again.

370
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:41,566
Chi?

371
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,666
Hiragana, katakana,
English alphabet, numbers -

372
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,366
please state
one letter at a time.

373
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:48,233
That's not what I was doing!

374
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,566
It's wasn't?!

375
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,033
That's dangerous;
you shouldn't use

376
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,266
the password
unless it's necessary.

377
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,333
You never know

378
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,633
when someone could be
listening, so be careful!

379
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,666
Um, okay!

380
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,900
There wasn't any
response, was there?

381
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,466
Chi?

382
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:05,966
I'm talking about
the word "chobits."

383
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,066
When my master checked
your specifications,

384
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:12,600
your personality changed.

385
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,133
I had thought that
perhaps... but no.

386
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,066
When you finally get down to it,

387
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,800
chobits might be just
an urban legend after all.

388
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,366
Chi?

389
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,566
It's time for the
wakey-wakey exercises again!

390
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,866
Do we have to do this today?!

391
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:32,366
Chi!

392
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,633
My goodness what the heck
is up with these people?

393
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,433
Hideki, where are you going?

394
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,100
Well, first of all, I think
we need to let Mr. Ueda know

395
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,800
that we found you, and that
everything's gonna be fine.

396
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:48,866
While we're out, we
should pay for this, too.

397
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:52,533
Chi. You took this
book along with you

398
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,166
when you were
kidnapped, didn't you?

399
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,400
Chi.

400
00:21:56,933 --> 00:22:00,433
Somehow, this book does
seem to be about Chi and me.

401
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
But who would want
to do that, and why?

402
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,033
Hideki?

403
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,033
Oh, sorry, it's nothing.
Let's go, Chi.

404
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,066
I'm glad that Chi
was able to come back.

405
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,766
Right, darling?

406
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,433
Hideki, what are memories?

407
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,233
Uh, well, let's see...

408
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:07,233
Happy things, fun things,
all jumbled together;

409
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,700
important things that
live inside your heart.

410
00:24:09,766 --> 00:24:13,933
They are things you can't
easily re-enter, unlike data.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,833
Do Chi and Hideki have memories?

412
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,366
Yes, we do.

413
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,466
Next episode of Chobits:
"Chi Answers."

414
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:23,100
Memories of Chi and Hideki...

415
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,900
Things that you can't
easily re-enter, hmm.
