1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,041
-Oh. Hey, Itsuki!
-[gasps]

2
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,750
Oh, good, it's just you, Miyako.

3
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,166
On your way somewhere?

4
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:28,666
Karaoke.

5
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,875
-By yourself?
-Yeah.

6
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,958
Well, in that case,
do you mind if I tag along?

7
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,041
[MIYAKO]
So, aren't you gonna sing?

8
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,708
No, I'm way too busy
to be fooling around.

9
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,458
I don't really understand
why we're here then.

10
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:52,000
Duh. Because it's safe and he'll
find me at my apartment.

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:54,541
-Who will?
-You know, my editor.

12
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,625
I take it your deadline
is fast approaching, then?

13
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,125
Well, one of them is.

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,125
In actuality,
there are two deadlines.

15
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:03,208
Okay, now you've lost me.

16
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,250
[ITSUKI] There's the deadline
where you have some wiggle room

17
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,750
in case some unforeseen
circumstances arise:

18
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,333
The tentative deadline.

19
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,083
But then,
there's the dangerous one

20
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:14,041
that, if missed, may prevent you
from releasing your book:

21
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,625
The true deadline.

22
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,291
[MIYAKO]
I feel like I know the answer,

23
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:19,625
but which of those
are you about to miss?

24
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,958
The true deadline.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,125
Itsuki.

26
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:28,666
-[MIYAKO gasps]
-No way!

27
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,833
How'd you find me?

28
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,625
In preparation for this,

29
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,125
I messed with
your phone's settings

30
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,541
so I'd be able to locate you
any time I need to.

31
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,250
I'm pretty sure
that's illegal!

32
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:40,000
I'd do anything for the sake
of releasing a book.

33
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:42,833
Just like a good editor should.

34
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,041
Now get your things.
You're writing at the office

35
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:46,583
and you're not leaving
until you're done.

36
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,208
Let go of me!
Picking me up like a kid.

37
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,208
I'm a proud man,
and I will not have this!

38
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:52,666
[TOKI]
Oh, you're so proud

39
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,583
of missing
your deadlines constantly?

40
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,083
Come on, dumbass. Let's go.

41
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,708
[ITSUKI]
Just hear me out, man.

42
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,958
[grunting]

43
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,791
-Sorry for making a scene.
-Ow, ow, ow!

44
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:03,041
Your name is Shirakawa,
I get that right?

45
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:06,041
The next time this ass tries
to run away from his work,

46
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,583
do me a favor
and let me know.

47
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,458
[MIYAKO]
Uhh... will do.

48
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,708
I don't get
the writing business.

49
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,166
Like, for real this time.

50
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,750
Now, I'm sure you're wondering
why we called you in today.

51
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,333
Are you familiar with this title
by any chance?

52
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,000
[GIRL]
"Mahou Academy."

53
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes. I've heard
of this one before.

54
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,583
[ringing]

55
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:38,000
[MAN] Hello, this is GF Bunko's
editorial department.

56
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,333
Oh, hello!
It's nice to hear from you.

57
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,916
Yes. Yes,
thank you again for that.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,041
I appreciate it.

59
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,541
[HARUTO]
Well, if there's one thing

60
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,416
people should be looking
forward to the most,

61
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,833
it's the intense battle scenes
that you can only see

62
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,625
in a visual medium
like an anime.

63
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,708
-[ITSUKI] Let me go!
-[TOKI] You know I won't!

64
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,166
-Give it up!
-[laughing]

65
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,750
My, they're a bit noisy
next door, aren't they?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,375
[groaning]

67
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,291
You're not going home
until you finish writing this.

68
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:11,375
[sighs]

69
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,333
This is pointless. I'll never
be able to finish in time!

70
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,791
I might as well run away.

71
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,375
[elevator bell dings]

72
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,708
[ITSUKI]
Uh...

73
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,500
What are you doing
in that box, dude?

74
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,666
Oh, it's just you, Setsuna.

75
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,625
You running away
from the same guy I am?

76
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,583
Nope. I just had
a regular meeting today

77
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,000
and was about to head home.

78
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,500
Aren't you lucky?

79
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:07,708
Oh! I just got an idea!

80
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,625
Why don't you and me get outta
here and go booty-watching?

81
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,500
Huh?

82
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:22,083
[ITSUKI] Well, here I am.
In a mixed-bath hot spring inn.

83
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,375
My editor's gonna kill me
if he finds out.

84
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,291
But he can't. I turned off
the GPS on my phone,

85
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,083
so my virtual shackles
are gone.

86
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,750
Are you ready to rock?

87
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,791
We have a batch
of booty soup waiting!

88
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,250
So we're doing this?
I can't tell if you're joking.

89
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,791
[SETSUNA]
Of course we're doing it!

90
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,416
[sighs]

91
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,333
Why do you want to see these
poor girls' asses so badly?

92
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,875
-Reference and motivation!
-What do you mean?

93
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,083
Well, you know that I'm drawing
a lot of tail in the series

94
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,416
I'm currently
working on, right?

95
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,333
Yeah, I guess so.
But what about it?

96
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,166
As of late, all my buns
have been comin' out the same.

97
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,916
It's like I've hit some sort
of artistic butt rut.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,333
So naturally, I want to stare

99
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,291
at some new asses
for inspiration!

100
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
Uh?

101
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:05,833
[ITSUKI] I guess even he hits
a creative wall sometimes.

102
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,666
[SETSUNA humming]

103
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:19,750
Why must you betray me
like this?

104
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,166
Huh? What's that?

105
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,208
Nothing.

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,583
[SETSUNA]
I never noticed before,

107
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,875
but you've got
a pretty cute butt.

108
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,875
I would hope
you've never noticed!

109
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,375
[chuckles]
Okay, let's get going!

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,916
I'm right behind you.

111
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
Huh!

112
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,500
Uhhh!

113
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:04,875
Would you look at that?

114
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,500
We've got some strapping
young men joining us.

115
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,083
[cackles]

116
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,875
You're absolutely right.
Isn't that something?

117
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,083
We rarely get them here.
[cackles]

118
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:18,208
Hello! You sure picked
the best spot, huh?

119
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,291
Hey! Setsuna!

120
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,416
Where did you two
darling boys come from?

121
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,666
Just Tokyo. And you ladies?

122
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,041
How sweet.
He called us "ladies!"

123
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:34,333
It's been about three years
since the last time

124
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,666
someone called me a lady!

125
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,583
Sure you don't mean thirty,
octogenarian?

126
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,500
Sorry you came all the way here

127
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,041
only to find us shriveled,
wrinkled old hags around.

128
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,333
You don't have to be sorry.

129
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:49,083
All girls are beautiful.
No matter the age!

130
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,333
Oh my, you sure know
the quickest way

131
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:52,875
to an old woman's heart,
don't you?

132
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:54,666
Oh, he better slow down.

133
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,166
Any more sweet talk and I'm
gonna take him home with me.

134
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,666
-My, my... [laughs]
-Hey. You there!

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,791
Why don't you come join
your friend over here?

136
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,833
Nothing to be afraid of dear.
We don't bite.

137
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,541
Hard anyway.

138
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,500
[cackles]

139
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,500
No, I'm fine out here!

140
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,583
Don't mind me!

141
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,166
Don't be shy. Hop in.

142
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,083
[OLD WOMEN laughing]

143
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,125
-We won't hurt you.
-Hold on.

144
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,666
[cackling continues]

145
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,041
Uh, S-Setsuna!

146
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,166
I'll catch you later, man!

147
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,958
I'm going to the men's bath!

148
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,708
[sighs]

149
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:40,333
I bet going to a hot spring
with Itsuki would be great.

150
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:43,333
Yeah. Just the two of us
without any clothes on.

151
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,500
[giggles]

152
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,000
[ITSUKI sighs]

153
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,708
That was legitimately
horrifying.

154
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,166
[sighs]

155
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,125
-[rattling]
-Hmm?

156
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,375
You?

157
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,833
Wait, but how?
I turned off my GPS!

158
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,666
I thought you might do that.

159
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,125
So I took the liberty
of putting

160
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,750
a tracking device
on your clothes.

161
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,125
Where'd you even get that?

162
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,666
I told you before...

163
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,916
if it's to get this book out,

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,875
I will do...
whatever it takes.

165
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:22,833
[ITSUKI whimpering]

166
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:26,125
[screaming]

[grunts]

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,625
What gives?

169
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,291
This will be your workplace
for the foreseeable future.

170
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,416
You've gotta be kidding me.

171
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,958
What--
What fresh hell is this?

172
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,083
This is a special room
where we trap--

173
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,750
where we put
authors and artists

174
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,583
so they can concentrate
on their work.

175
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,500
You can't be serious!

176
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,541
I refuse to work
in this dungeon!

177
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,833
Why can't you just put me up

178
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,541
in a hotel room
like you do with Kanikou?

179
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,041
Only authors who have had
their work made into anime

180
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,208
or top the sales charts
are awarded such luxuries.

181
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,750
You've got three days.

182
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,875
That's when we hit
the real final deadline.

183
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,375
-Got it?
-Uhh...

184
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,875
What happens if I don't make it?

185
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,333
I'll kill you.

186
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,541
You'll... You'll what?

187
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,250
[TOKI]
You heard me. See ya.

188
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,166
I'll let you out
once you've finished.

189
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,416
Hold on a minute!

190
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,250
How am I supposed
to go to the bathroom?

191
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,708
[ITSUKI]
Don't tell me.

192
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,125
Feel free to use
that box at your leisure.

193
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,458
Just think of it
as another way

194
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,916
to maximize
your remaining days for work.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,875
Can't have you wasting time
walking down the hall.

196
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,375
This is insane!
Let me out of here!

197
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,708
I mean, please let me out!
I'll be good. I promise!

198
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:57,291
[sobbing]
Please!

199
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,791
This can't be real.

200
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,833
Did he actually lock me
in this prison cell?

201
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,916
The only choice
I have is to write.

202
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,750
Uh...

203
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,000
[groans]

204
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,458
[groans]

205
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,041
[groans]

206
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,666
[cackling]

207
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,958
[evil laughter]

208
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,125
Uh!

209
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,583
What the hell
are these monsters?

210
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,083
[roaring]

211
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,041
[SIEG]
My hands are shaking.

212
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,000
Am I actually experiencing fear?

213
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,916
[roars]

214
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:47,916
[screaming]

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,291
[ITSUKI grunts]

216
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,291
[breathing heavily]

217
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,708
[typing]

218
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:15,291
[ITSUKI]
I have to hurry up and finish,

219
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,750
or I'm gonna die.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,125
[panting]

221
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,791
[SIEG] I don't want to die.
Hilde. Hilde!

222
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:30,500
[snickers]

223
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,666
You look pathetic, vermin.

224
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,583
It's Chrom!

225
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,666
I'm not letting you
escape me again.

226
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,666
This is where you die, Sieg!

227
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,958
[roaring]

228
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,416
[shuddering, screaming]

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,541
[TOKI] I'm not letting you
escape me again, Itsuki!

230
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,416
[screaming]

231
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,583
Just a dream.

232
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,833
A dream?
I wasted all that time.

233
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,708
-[HARUTO] Hey!
-Huh?

234
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,666
-Itsuki!
-Haruto?

235
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,375
You okay in there?

236
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,083
[ITSUKI]
I'd be lying if I said I was.

237
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,000
You sound so defeated, man.

238
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,291
You know, you might
get away with giving up.

239
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,208
The editors aren't
completely heartless.

240
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,333
If you honestly can't do it,

241
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,833
I'm sure
they'll delay the release.

242
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,416
That reminds me, your new volume
comes out in March too, right?

243
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,583
Yeah. But mine's already
well past the revision stage.

244
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,500
[grunts]

245
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,375
So, what are you gonna do?
Wanna give up?

246
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,583
Not yet. I'll keep
grinding away for a while.

247
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,333
All right. Good luck.

248
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,791
Thanks.

249
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,541
I'm gonna finish this
as fast as possible

250
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,291
so I can escape this hellhole.

251
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,000
[chuckles]

252
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,916
By the way, they don't let you
use cell phones in there, right?

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,041
Want me to deliver any messages
to Chihiro or Nayu for you?

254
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,625
[ITSUKI]
Hmm?

255
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,041
Just tell them not to worry.

256
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,958
Roger. Well, you can do it.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,375
Okay. I'm not letting them
get any further ahead of me.

258
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,708
[typing]

259
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,708
[ITSUKI] Somehow, I made it
to the climax in one piece.

260
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,208
But I can't write a scene
that I'm satisfied with.

261
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,208
Damn it!
I'm so close to finishing this!

262
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,291
-[HARUTO] Itsuki.
-Uh?

263
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,125
I didn't think
you'd come back again.

264
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,291
Well, I had
to deliver your gifts.

265
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:50,791
First, a lunch
that Chihiro made for you.

266
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,833
I made some food.

267
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,083
Can you take it
to my big brother for me?

268
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:59,083
Sure thing.
I bet it'll lift his spirits.

269
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,791
I hope so.
I know it's not much,

270
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,333
but I want to help
any way that I can.

271
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,000
Though I'm sure my brother
will be fine no matter what.

272
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,875
Chihiro.

273
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,250
[HARUTO]
And second, some more

274
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,875
Valentine's chocolates
from your readers.

275
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,083
-Better late than never.
-[ITSUKI] Ohh!

276
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:17,583
Thank you so much
for bringing me these.

277
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:20,625
Also, tell Chihiro
I said thanks.

278
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,166
Will do. Hey,

279
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,583
let's all get together
for drinks at your place soon.

280
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,500
[ITSUKI]
Yeah.

281
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,833
Whoa!

282
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:34,916
Huh?

283
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:37,625
Uh!

284
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,291
[MIYAKO] Do your best
on your manuscript.

285
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,041
[NAYUTA] When you get back,
let's go to a hot spring.

286
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,000
From your loving wife.

287
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,083
[chuckles]

288
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,375
Whatever, kid.

289
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,083
[moans]

290
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, man, this is so good!

291
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,541
[eating noisily]

292
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,708
Oh, this chocolate
is delicious too.

293
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,625
All right.

294
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,041
This battle decides my fate!

295
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,000
[CHROM laughing]

296
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,958
It looks like this will be
the end of your story.

297
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,916
Now doesn't it, Sieg?

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,750
[SIEG gasping]

299
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:29,958
Ah!

300
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,375
[panting]

301
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,000
[NOBUSHIGE]
Are you giving up, Sieg?

302
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,708
[YUUNA] If my brother thinks
you're strong, then so do I!

303
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,625
[HILDE]
You can't lose, big brother!

304
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,041
I want you to come back to me!

305
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,166
[SIEG]
Hilde.

306
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,333
[ITSUKI] When this is over,
I want to eat

307
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:47,208
Chihiro's delicious food again!

308
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,916
[SIEG] When this is over,
I want to eat

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,750
Hilde's disgusting food again!

310
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,458
[ITSUKI]
I want to drink and play games

311
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,416
with Haruto and Miyako again!

312
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
And go on trips with Setsuna!

313
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,583
[SIEG] I want to spar
with Nobushige and Yuuna again!

314
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,791
[ITSUKI] I want Ashley
to call me "big brother" again!

315
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,208
[SIEG] I want Hilde to call me
"big brother" again!

316
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,666
[ITSUKI]
I want to see Kanikou again!

317
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,041
[SIEG]
I want to see Hilde again!

318
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:15,208
No matter what, I'm going
to make it back to Hilde.

319
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,791
I refuse to be beaten by you!

320
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,666
[ITSUKI] I'm going home,
getting drunk, and going to bed!

321
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,416
I refuse to be beaten
by this deadline!

322
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,083
That's impossible!

323
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,583
How do you have
the strength to stand?

324
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,833
How can you still
bring yourself to fight?

325
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,916
[screaming]

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,666
[screaming]

327
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,250
[ITSUKI/SIEG]
'Cause this is my will.

328
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,000
The strength of us all!

329
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:43,000
True power!

330
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,291
[typing]

331
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,416
[ITSUKI]
Uhh...

332
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,583
It's done.

333
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,041
I finally finished it.

334
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,083
And there's no doubt about it.

335
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,500
This is my strongest,

336
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,833
most well-written piece
of literature to date!

337
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,750
[laughing]

338
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,833
Hell yeah!
I'm the best!

339
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,583
I'm so brilliant,
I scare myself sometimes!

340
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,541
[continues laughing]

341
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
-[chair clatters]
-[ITSUKI grunts]

342
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,791
Just you wait, "Mahou" fans.

343
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,833
I'm giving you
the greatest masterpiece yet

344
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:01,791
as thanks for... your gifts.

345
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,708
[ITSUKI] Check it out.
They've got 'em all on display.

346
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,958
I don't know about you,
but I'm always nervous

347
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:22,458
on a new release date.

348
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,250
It's been four whole years
since I debuted.

349
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,291
But this feeling
just never goes away.

350
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, got that right.

351
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,208
Yes, buy it. Buy it!
You know you want to.

352
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:39,291
[inhales sharply]
Uhh...

353
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,458
Huh?

354
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:42,750
[groans]

355
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,666
-Huh?
-[HARUTO] Hmm?

356
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,041
-Ha!
-[grunts]

357
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,708
-Is that one any good?
-Yeah, I like it.

358
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,375
Heh! Well, clearly, that guy
has damn good taste.

359
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,625
Good for you.

360
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,125
Ha!

361
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,833
[grunts]

362
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,291
Uhh...

363
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
[ice cubes clink]

364
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,083
[drawn-out groan]

365
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,375
Come on, man.
Don't let it get to you.

366
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,875
My book has
the soon-to-be-an-anime bump.

367
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,458
Plus, it comes
with exclusive swag

368
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,541
depending on where you buy it.

369
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,166
We shouldn't be comparing
our sales

370
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,333
when I have
an unfair advantage.

371
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,458
Yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

372
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,083
This is nothing new.

373
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:48,000
But it's still frustrating.

374
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,250
A lot.

375
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,708
I can understand that.

376
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,916
Plus, this new volume is the
best work I've ever produced.

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,166
I had to suffer
to make it happen.

378
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,166
But I feel more accomplished
than ever before.

379
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,166
My efforts have never yielded
such positive results.

380
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,000
-I'm glad.
-Know what?

381
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,041
I'll even say that this is
the universe's best book.

382
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,250
Your "Spirit Knight
of the Distant Sea" thirteen?

383
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,750
It's crap next
to "Mahou Academy" five.

384
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,375
Best in the whole universe, eh?

385
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,458
You know, it's funny,
I actually find my series

386
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,166
to be better than yours, too.

387
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,125
Which means I'm the best
in the universe.

388
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,375
[BOTH chuckle]

389
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,583
Well, I'll win soon.

390
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,125
[HARUTO] You took the words
right out of my mouth.

391
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,416
Huh?

392
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,916
Nothing. So!

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,666
Since I'm the one
with the anime series,

394
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,583
food's on me today.

395
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,791
Are you serious?

396
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,208
Then I'm ordering me some cake!

397
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,666
[buzzing]

398
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,875
Uhh!

399
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,250
What are you worried about?

400
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,541
Your book came out
on time, didn't it?

401
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:51,083
Sorry, I guess
it's a force of habit.

402
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,291
Yeah?

403
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,500
[TOKI on phone]
Hey, Itsuki, can we talk?

404
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,208
There's something
I need to tell you.

405
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,416
Uh, sure, what's going on?

406
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
[TOKI] Trust me, this is
nothing to be scared of.

407
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,916
Congratulations.

408
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,500
They've decided "Mahou Academy"
will be made into a manga.

409
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:08,833
Uhh...
