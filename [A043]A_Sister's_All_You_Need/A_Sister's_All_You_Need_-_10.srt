hoping to do research.

354
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,666
I hope I didn't get in the way.

355
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,958
Nah, not at all.

356
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,208
Actually, I got a new idea
thanks to you.

357
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,666
Really?

358
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,416
Yeah, a character that sees
everything as food.

359
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,125
Sound familiar?

360
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,625
Hey, I don’t do that!

361
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,625
I just cook with fish
a lot so it’s on my mind!

362
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,708
And I liked those jellyfish
cause they were cute!

363
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,166
But you’d eat them, right?

364
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,416
I mean, yeah, but...

365
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,791
It’s nice to see you get so
excited about the little things.

366
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,791
Well, can you blame me for it?

367
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,916
You rarely take me anywhere,
so I had to make the most of it.

368
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,166
[ITSUKI]
Oh yeah?

369
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,583
What’s up?

370
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:38,458
Whaddya say we go somewhere
again sometime soon?

371
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,458
-Really?
-Sure.

372
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,208
[laughs softly]

373
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,541
That’d be great!

374
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,000
Then it’s a promise.

375
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,208
[ITSUKI]
Yeah. It’s a promise.

376
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,000
It’s getting late,
so I’m gonna head home.

377
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,125
I’ll come by tomorrow
to cook for you.

378
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,541
[ITSUKI]
Cool.

379
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,083
[TRAIN ANNOUNCER]
We have an announcement to make.

380
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,416
Due to an accident
involving an injury,

381
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,041
the inbound train is currently
suspended from operation.

382
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,625
We will make
another announcement

383
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,208
when the line
is back in service.

384
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,083
We apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.

385
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:14,583
Oh, great.

386
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,541
Sounds like it’ll take a while.

387
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,750
Well, I’d rather grab a taxi
than wait around here.

388
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,500
We’re headed in the same
direction anyway,

389
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,291
so you can ride with me
if you want.

390
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:28,208
So which fish that we saw
was your favorite?

391
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:29,750
The spotted garden eel.

392
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,000
It moved all funny.

393
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:33,666
Yeah. I thought that one
was adorable.

394
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,791
With that kind of name,
and the way it wiggled,

395
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,291
I’m pretty sure Kanikou
would have loved it.

396
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,916
[giggling nervously]
Yeah, she would.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,375
Believe it or not, when we went
to the zoo the other day,

398
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,875
she kept taking pictures
of the animals’ dongs.

399
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,375
She’s such a little pervert.

400
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,041
Yeah, she sure is.

401
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,833
Though I have
to wonder about girls

402
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:50,875
who are that vulgar.

403
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,041
It catches me off guard.

404
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,583
Yeah. I see that.

405
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,875
Gotta say though.

406
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,166
I think it’s cool
that there’s a girl

407
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,833
I can have dirty
conversations with.

408
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,083
[CHIHIRO]
Hmm.

409
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,458
Why don’t you stay
the night tonight?

410
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,625
No one’s touched your room.

411
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,208
It’s just how you left it.

412
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,500
Nah, I’m goin’ home.

413
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,166
Oh, okay.

414
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:18,458
Well, um,
thanks for taking me home.

415
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,416
[ITSUKI groans]

416
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,583
Oh, Dad.

417
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,916
Chihiro, time for you to go.

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,500
Uh, but...

419
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,708
[ITSUKI'S DAD]
Itsuki.

420
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,333
Thanks for the gift.

421
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,375
Really.

422
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,333
[ITSUKI]
Don’t mention it.

423
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,500
The two of you haven’t
spoken in so long.

424
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,291
Hey Dad, don’t you want to talk?

425
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,041
[CHIHIRO]
Guess not.

426
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,250
Well, I’ll see you tomorrow,
right big bro?

427
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,000
[ITSUKI]
Yeah.

428
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,041
[CHIHIRO]
Hey, Itsuki!

429
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,416
Listen.

430
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,041
I really want you and Dad
to patch things up.

431
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,583
We’re family.

432
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,083
[ITSUKI]
We can go now.

433
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,166
[ITSUKI]
I know Chihiro, but...

434
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,833
[sighs]

435
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,166
That was a bad anime
to the very end.

436
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:03,541
[groans]

437
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,375
Why do people even want
anime adaptations?

438
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,500
Huh?

439
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:13,916
[HARUTO'S SISTER]
What are you doing?

440
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,541
Havin’ myself a drink.

441
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,208
What’s your excuse
for being up this late?

442
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,791
I don’t have to explain
myself to you.

443
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,250
Okay.

444
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,375
So, uh...

445
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,041
The anime adaption
that you did of your novel,

446
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,583
it just finished airing, right?

447
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,083
You watch?

448
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,458
Not on purpose, I just happened
to turn on the TV.

449
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,875
Oh. Okay.

450
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,791
It was pretty terrible, huh?

451
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,625
Yep. Total trash.

452
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,250
[chuckles] Okay.

453
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,708
[HARUTO'S SISTER]
Worse than trash.

454
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,500
Everyone involved
in making it should die.

455
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,791
Hey now, you don’t have
to get that angry.

456
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,458
Huh? What makes you
think I’m angry?

457
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,375
I refuse to accept
that was your story,

458
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,750
why should I even care?

459
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,166
It was nothing like the book
from episode one.

460
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,375
The animation was so bad,
they weren’t even moving!

461
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,750
The acting was stiff,

462
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,333
the designs looked nothing
like the originals

463
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,041
and the dialogue made no sense
which ruined the story.

464
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,041
Hey I don’t need
your stupid head pats!

465
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,875
Oh, I’m sorry.

466
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,000
I promise.

467
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,250
That won't happen again.

468
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,250
I'm gonna do better next time.

469
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:25,625
Well, that goes
without saying!

470
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,458
If you let them make garbage
like that again,

471
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:28,875
I’ll never forgive you.

472
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:31,375
So work harder on the next one,
okay?

473
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,625
[chuckles softly]

474
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:37,208
[HARUTO]
I guess I was wrong.

475
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,291
It is nice having a little
sister every now and then.
