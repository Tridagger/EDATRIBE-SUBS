1
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,291
[GIRL]
Wakey-wakey.

2
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:14,541
Rise and shine!

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,666
That's my big bro.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,875
Good morning!

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,958
Hey, Alice. Morning.

6
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:23,916
[BOY]
This is my little sister Alice.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,250
She may not look it,

8
00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,833
but she'll be turning
fourteen this year.

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,208
Well, this won't do.
You're still so sweepy!

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,458
Guess I'll just have to do
something to wake you up.

11
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,208
Normally I'd want to keep going,
but today's special.

12
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,666
'Cause I made breakfast
and set the table all by myself!

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,958
So, hurry your butt downstairs
before it gets cold!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,083
I'll be right there.

15
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,375
[ALICE giggling]

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,875
[BOY] I washed my face
in the bathwater

17
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,875
that my sister just used

18
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,375
and wiped it dry with her bra.

19
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,125
-Then headed for the kitchen.
-Uh...

20
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,500
There, I found Yoshiko,
who should have died yesterday.

21
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,833
I was very surprised.

22
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,333
Well, what are you waiting for?

23
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,916
I made it just for you
so dig in!

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,875
Thanks. I appreciate it.

25
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,000
Laid before me was an omelet
made from Alice's eggs

26
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:14,916
and a cup of Alice's milk.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,666
So creamy and rich.

28
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,708
The taste of my little sister
spread throughout my mouth.

29
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:22,583
Her newly hatched eggs
and freshly squeezed milk

30
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,916
tasted delicious!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,291
You silly-head.

32
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,291
You've got some ketchup

33
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,500
on the corner of your mouth.

34
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:29,958
What am I gonna do with you?

35
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:32,500
[BOY] Alice reached through
a portal to a parallel world,

36
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,291
pulled out
some just-worn panties,

37
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,041
and wiped my mouth with them.

38
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:38,458
My little sister's hot,
fresh-off-the-crotch panties

39
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,583
tasted so good!

40
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,333
The alluring aroma
and tender taste

41
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:43,875
of her succulent juices
swirled around in my head!

42
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,708
This was enlightenment!

43
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,958
The hell is this?

44
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,291
Easy there!
Where'd that come from, man?

45
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,791
Oh, don't you give me that.
You moron!

46
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,375
This world is a mess.
I'm at a loss for words!

47
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,125
At a loss for words, huh?

48
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,583
I take it you've been moved
by my masterpiece?

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,875
You are unbelievably stupid.

50
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:09,208
[TOKI] All right, just in case
I'm misunderstanding somehow,

51
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,000
this is supposed to be
your manuscript

52
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,458
for the second chapter
of "The Scarlet Jager," right?

53
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,041
That's correct, sir.

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,958
That's funny.

55
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,791
According to
the chapter synopsis,

56
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,208
in the opening
of chapter two,

57
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,083
the protagonist is shocked
when the heroine

58
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:25,041
who died protecting him
from a demon's attack

59
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,458
at the end of chapter one

60
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,708
is having breakfast at his house
the next morning,

61
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,250
like nothing ever happened.

62
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:34,333
And? What's your point?
That's what I wrote about.

63
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,041
Are we talking about
the same thing?

64
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,500
The protagonist clearly says
he was surprised.

65
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,333
And why was he surprised?

66
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:41,750
'Cause what's-her-face
was there.

67
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:42,916
It's Yoshiko!

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How can you forget the name

69
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,916
of the main heroine?

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,541
But I guess that plotline
is in here,

71
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,500
even if it feels
totally out of place.

72
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:50,958
[ITSUKI]
Good grief.

73
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,083
What am I going to do
with an editor like you?

74
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:56,041
Oh, you are not about
to blame this on me.

75
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,333
[exasperated sigh]

76
00:02:57,416 --> 00:02:58,375
Anyway, that's not even

77
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,541
the biggest problem here.

78
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,625
What is?

79
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,750
Who the hell is this new

80
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,708
Alice character

81
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:03,875
that's in every scene?

82
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,041
I've never once been told

83
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,000
about this girl!

84
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,041
She's the dude's little sis.

85
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,958
If you'd paid attention
to his character bio

86
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,375
that I so painstakingly wrote,
you'd know that.

87
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,083
[TOKI]
It was a single sentence!

88
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,000
I assumed she'd just be
a background character

89
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,208
but you made her a freak!

90
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,000
If by freak
you mean freakishly cute,

91
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,416
then you've totally nailed it!

92
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,666
[TOKI]
No, you dumbass!

93
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,166
Not only is she naked
all the time,

94
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,041
which is already
a big enough offense,

95
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,625
but she's got ridiculous powers
that only exist to encourage

96
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,291
her big brother's
deranged fetish!

97
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,791
I mean, the guy wiped his face
with his sister's bra

98
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,500
and then ate
her dirty underwear!

99
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:35,416
Come on, man!

100
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,125
-He's just...
-Mm-hmm.

101
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,416
"Disgusting" isn't enough,
but there's no better word!

102
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,916
Let me just confirm

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,541
that you didn't
accidentally type "panties"

104
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,666
instead of some kind of food.

105
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,958
[ITSUKI ] I'm insulted.

106
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,041
I'm a professional.

107
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,000
I'd never make such

108
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,250
a stupid mistake like that.

109
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,916
So, "Alice's milk"
wasn't a mistake?

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,250
Of course not.
It's simply milk from her boobs.

111
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,208
Delicious, rich,
creamy boob milk

112
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:56,541
How about Alice's eggs?

113
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,041
Delicious eggs that Alice laid.

114
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,291
I told you, I wouldn't make
a mistake like that.

115
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:03,250
[inhales sharply]
Denied.

116
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,041
-Huh?
-Denied!

117
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,333
We could never publish this!

118
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,791
Settle down.
I admit that I may have gone

119
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,166
just a teensy bit too far

120
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,083
with the whole milk
and eggs thing.

121
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,333
But the story's
about psychic powers.

122
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,083
Shouldn't I be able
to include some things

123
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,458
that are a little unorthodox?

124
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:21,583
A little... unorthodox?

125
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,125
Yeah, it happens all the time.

126
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,416
Like when the hero's parents

127
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
turn out to be
some legendary adventurer.

128
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,500
Or they're the heir
of some ancient martial art,

129
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,666
and only they have
the skills--

130
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,208
What is wrong with you?

131
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:33,500
How does a world where people
lay eggs and eat panties

132
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,833
compare to a battle story
with cliche plot points?

133
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,291
Uh...

134
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,833
Okay, but washing your face
with the bathwater

135
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:41,750
your sister just used is normal.

136
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,666
So, can we keep that?
Everyone does it.

137
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,541
Like hell everyone does it!

138
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,500
You friggin'
sister-complex freak!

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,125
I'm serious.

140
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:21,541
I'm rejecting that manuscript.

141
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,791
[groans]

142
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,666
I don't mind you working
on a new project,

143
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,083
but you better
still be progressing

144
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,833
with volume five
of "Mahou Academy."

145
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,208
The deadline's at the end
of the month.

146
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,708
Yeah. I got it covered.

147
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
Why do I feel like
you're lying to me?

148
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know, but I'm not!

149
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:35,958
I'll get it done.

150
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,708
[sighs]

151
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:41,166
[sighs]

152
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,750
Honestly, his obsession
with little sisters

153
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,125
is always a problem.

154
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:47,666
Hello, Toki.

155
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,791
How are you?

156
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,875
Oh.

157
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,875
[TOKI]
Hey, Chihiro. I'm good.

158
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,666
Here for a meeting
with my brother?

159
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,500
Yeah, we just
finished up, actually.

160
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,833
That looks heavy.

161
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,291
-You pick up stuff for dinner?
-Yeah.

162
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,708
Bro's got guests coming over,
so I bought extra.

163
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,958
[chuckles]
You seem like

164
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,833
a pretty reliable
younger brother, kid.

165
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,416
Well, I guess.

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,875
Oh.

167
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you for always keeping
my brother on track.

168
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,500
I really appreciate it.

169
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:13,666
Hey, no problem.

170
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, I'll be on my way, then.

171
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,375
[sighs]

172
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:25,166
If only Chihiro were
his younger sister,

173
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,666
Itsuki probably
wouldn't have ended up

174
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,625
with his little fixation.

175
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,000
A sister's all he needs.

176
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,083
Then again, he probably
wouldn't have become

177
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,083
an author at all
if that were the case.

178
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,541
Talk about complicated.

179
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:46,958
-[doorbell rings]
-Hmm?

180
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,791
Hey.

181
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:50,875
Hey.

182
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,000
I ran into Toki on my way here.

183
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,125
[ITSUKI]
Huh?

184
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,333
Did your meeting
with him go well?

185
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,833
Yeah, totally.

186
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,666
Hmm.

187
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,416
So, what are you makin' tonight?

188
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,708
Either stir-fried shrimp
or paella.

189
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,458
Take a guess at
what was on sale today.

190
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,458
Yeah, shrimp.

191
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,416
[doorbell rings]

192
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,416
Hmm?

193
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,583
Yo.

194
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,333
Hot guy comin' through.

195
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,000
-Hey.
-Come on.

196
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,250
I was trying to be funny.
Play along.

197
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,208
Whoa, smells great!

198
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,875
How are things, Fuwa?

199
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,250
-Good?
-Hey, Chihiro.

200
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,250
Yup.

201
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,208
By the way, I brought a gift.

202
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,208
Mind if I find a place
for it in the fridge?

203
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh, not at all!

204
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,708
You do know this is
my apartment, right?

205
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,000
I know, I know.
What's yours is mine.

206
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:45,083
[HARUTO]
So, how's your new series going?

207
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,750
Itsuki Hashima's first book
where the main heroine

208
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,083
isn't the little sister.

209
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,583
-Just canceled today.
-Really?

210
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,500
I thought the proposal
was pretty promising.

211
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,500
[ITSUKI chuckles]

212
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,000
My heroines being little sisters

213
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,750
is the lifeblood of my work.

214
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,791
-[doorbell rings]
-Hmm?

215
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,416
Must be Kanikou and Miyako.

216
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,791
What a lovely evening this is!

217
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,500
Let's get down
and dirty together.

218
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:09,875
[gasps]
Nayu!

219
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,041
We just got here,
and you're already on that?

220
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,708
Sounded like
a normal greeting to me.

221
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,833
Silly Myaa.

222
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,875
Yeah, that was
the furthest thing

223
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,083
from a greeting.

224
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,416
Whatever, close
the door behind you.

225
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,166
-Kani!
-Miyako!

226
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,666
Evening. What's up?

227
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,833
Not much.
Good evening to you, too.

228
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,500
By the way, if the mood
ever strikes you,

229
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,083
-feel free to call me "big sis."
-[door closes]

230
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,291
No, thank you.

231
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,541
You might as well get
a head start,

232
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,958
because when Itsuki
and I get married,

233
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,250
you're going to be
my brother-in-law,

234
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,666
and then you'll
pretty much have to.

235
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,791
-No, I won't!
-Shut up!

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,208
[NAYUTA]
That sucks!

237
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,125
Your new project's
already been canceled?

238
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,541
Well, these kinds
of things happen.

239
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:43,875
But I really liked
where the story was going.

240
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,208
[gasps] Hold on,
I just realized something!

241
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,833
This means that aside
from your editor,

242
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,750
I'm the only one
in the whole world who read it!

243
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:50,958
Yeah, no.

244
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,500
Everyone in this room
read it, too.

245
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,791
Yup.

246
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,791
Yeah, I guess
we all have read it.

247
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,541
I can't believe your story
got around so much.

248
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,833
That manuscript's a whore.

249
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,666
Don't personify my story.

250
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,041
Hey, Chihiro?

251
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:08,208
How much longer
till dinner's done?

252
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:10,791
[CHIHIRO]
Uh... around thirty minutes.

253
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,250
Half an hour?

254
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,833
That's a whole lot of time
we have still to kill.

255
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,666
-You wanna make out?
-Just stop.

256
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,958
How about playing a game then?

257
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,166
Does that sound good?

258
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,916
Yeah. Let's do it.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,875
[grunts]
Prince Manwhore here.

260
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,375
He can never take a hint.

261
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:26,000
Hello pot?
It's the kettle calling again.

262
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,250
Yo, Nayu.

263
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:28,375
Can you find it in your heart

264
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:29,500
to stop calling me that?

265
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,541
Great, thanks.

266
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,500
[ITSUKI]
So, what should we play?

267
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,666
[HARUTO]
Hmm? Probably something easy

268
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,875
that we don't need
to spend time setting up.

269
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,333
Oh. Ever heard
of "turtle soup"?

270
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,583
Dude, what?
Weird name.

271
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,708
Now that's Prince Manwhore
for you.

272
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,833
Are you talking about
your little turtle?

273
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,000
Ignore her.

274
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,416
Can you explain it to us?

275
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,708
I certainly can.

276
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,541
Turtle Soup, also known as
a "lateral thinking puzzle"

277
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,791
is a spoken game.

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,958
First, the master tells the
story of a mysterious incident.

279
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,875
The other players then ask
yes-or-no questions

280
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,416
about said mysterious incident
and try to solve the mystery

281
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,083
using the information
they've uncovered.

282
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh. That's more fun
than the name implies.

283
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,500
[HARUTO] When writers
get together for drinks,

284
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,291
it's pretty common for us
to think up questions

285
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,833
on the spot
to play this game.

286
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,333
It's a good way to flex
your creativity muscles.

287
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,625
But, if you don't come up
with an interesting scenario

288
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,458
or one that sucks,
your writer peers

289
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:22,958
will berate you
and say stuff like:

290
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,333
"You're not any better
since you won

291
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,625
your newcomer award!"

292
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,208
That part doesn't sound fun.

293
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,458
All right.

294
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,083
Now why don't I give an example?

295
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,291
Ready?

296
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,541
'Cause you're about
to be presented

297
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,166
with a mystery
that will blow your mind!

298
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,625
Ah, you can blow
my mind any time!

299
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,750
Like now!

300
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,458
Get your shit together,
will you?

301
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,750
[clears throat]

302
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,916
Okay. Everyone listen up.

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,875
A man gets married.

304
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,333
However, his wife is
a perfect uggo.

305
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,791
She was ugly both
inside and out.

306
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:53,833
Not a single good quality
to her name.

307
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,750
However, the man lives his life
without complaint.

308
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,875
He has no gripes whatsoever.
Why is that?

309
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,166
-[overlapping chatter]
-[HARUTO] I'm pretty confident

310
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,166
she's a little sister.

311
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,208
Right?

312
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,416
The hell?

313
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,791
How did all three of you
get it right

314
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,291
without asking one question?

315
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,333
Well, your scenario
kinda sucked to begin with.

316
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:13,958
But I did like the phrasing
"his wife was a perfect uggo,"

317
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,500
because it was sort of funny.

318
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,291
So, I won't go so far
as to insult you personally.

319
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,833
He's just used to writing about
trashy scenarios in his books.

320
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,833
That's not a good excuse.

321
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,875
All right, I've got one,
so I'll go next.

322
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:30,208
A novelist completely breaks
a deadline.

323
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,166
However, not only does
he not get in trouble,

324
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,916
but his editor
thanks him for it.

325
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,208
Why is that?

326
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,625
Why would they thank him
for missing a deadline?

327
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,208
So weird.

328
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,083
Hey, uh, Prince Manwhore,

329
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,916
is this just a fantasy
for your little turtle?

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,416
No.

331
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,541
[NAYUTA] Does this story
take place in modern Japan?

332
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,333
-It does.
-[ITSUKI] You liar!

333
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,041
That is so unrealistic!

334
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,375
I refuse to believe this is
in modern day Japan

335
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,958
with the publishing world
the way it is.

336
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,333
We don't get
a deadline extension

337
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,875
if we step on a land mine!

338
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,708
Come on! True authors
know that better than anyone!

339
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,500
Well, I've never broken
a deadline before, so...

340
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,875
Huh? You're a disgrace
to the profession!

341
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,708
You can be lord of deflowering,
but you won't break a deadline?

342
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,000
That's some value system.

343
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,458
Listen, I'm not a manwhore,
so drop it!

344
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,041
You grow as a person every time
you miss a deadline.

345
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:20,250
Letting someone down
really makes you reevaluate.

346
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,875
Yeah? Then why do you still
think it's okay to miss them?

347
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:25,166
[NAYUTA] You'll never break out
of that shell of yours

348
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,625
if you can't learn
to try new things.

349
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:31,458
Wait. Break out
of my... shell?

350
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,541
-[ITSUKI] Mm-hmm.
-[NAYUTA] Mm-hmm.

351
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:35,125
What the hell!

352
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,208
Why are you two encouraging me
to make my publisher mad?

353
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:38,833
[grunts]
Can you just get back

354
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,375
to solving the riddle please?

355
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,541
[ITSUKI] Fine.
Here's a question.

356
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,250
Was the novelist
a little sister?

357
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,791
-[HARUTO] No.
-[ITSUKI] Really?

358
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,000
She's not even a little sister

359
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,541
and they let her slide
on her deadline?

360
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,416
[MIYAKO] He already said
the novelist was a "he"

361
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
when he set
the scene earlier.

362
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,458
[ITSUKI]
Oh, that's right.

363
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,125
Then does the novelist
have a little sister?

364
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,166
[HARUTO] Unknown.
He may have one, or may not.

365
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,541
[ITSUKI] All right,
considering it's an unknown,

366
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,000
that's probably not
an important factor.

367
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,625
[MIYAKO] Um, is the novelist
very popular?

368
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,083
[HARUTO]
Unknown.

369
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,958
[MIYAKO] Okay, then is he
the opposite of popular?

370
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,041
[HARUTO]
Unknown.

371
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,958
[MIYAKO]
Those are all unknowns?

372
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,791
Then... do parts
of the novelist's profile,

373
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,000
such as sales, income,
or family life,

374
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:21,416
have anything to do with it?

375
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,250
-[HARUTO] No.
-[MIYAKO] No?

376
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:26,750
Hmm. So, his background
is irrelevant.

377
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,791
Okay. Should we ask
about the editorial staff?

378
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,458
[HARUTO]
Oh, you're on the right track.

379
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,833
Oh! I get it!
How's this?

380
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,583
Has the editorial staff
found themselves

381
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,250
in a dangerous situation?

382
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,916
-[HARUTO] Yes.
-Okay then.

383
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,416
Was the editorial staff somehow
saved from this situation

384
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,208
by the novelist
missing this deadline?

385
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,916
-[HARUTO] Yes.
-Yeah!

386
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,833
But I can't think
of any dangerous situation

387
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,791
that could be remedied
by missing a deadline.

388
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,083
Huh.

389
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,291
Missing a deadline

390
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,958
or was it breaking a deadline?

391
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,750
I don't know. Uh...

392
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,958
Haruto, can you tell us
the story again?

393
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,708
Exactly like you did before?

394
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:01,750
Yeah, sure.

395
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,375
A novelist completely breaks
a deadline.

396
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,791
However, not only does he
not get in trouble,

397
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,000
but his editor
thanks him for it.

398
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,875
Why is that?

399
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,583
Uh-huh, that's what I thought.

400
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,625
So, was this deadline
for a publication?

401
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,250
[chuckles]
No.

402
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,000
Wait. What does that even mean?

403
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,625
[ITSUKI]
Have you solved it too, Kanikou?

404
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,375
-Yeah!
-What?

405
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,083
[ITSUKI]
All right, so did the novelist

406
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,291
physically break
that "deadline?"

407
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,458
[HARUTO]
Yes.

408
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,791
[NAYUTA]
And was the editorial office

409
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,541
completely closed
until the novelist

410
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:32,875
broke that "deadline"?

411
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,333
[HARUTO]
Yes.

412
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,666
[NAYUTA] When the novelist
broke that "deadline,"

413
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,375
was the entire editorial staff

414
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,625
in a situation
where they couldn't move?

415
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,875
Uh-huh.

416
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,500
You've basically figured it out.

417
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,041
Damn right I figured it out.

418
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,000
But let's go over it
just to be sure.

419
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,916
The editorial office
had its door and windows

420
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,791
completely closed off.

421
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,500
So, all of the staff
had succumbed

422
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,750
to CO2 poisoning
and passed out.

423
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,083
That's when the novelist,
who had come to the office

424
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,333
to explain why he was going
to miss his deadline,

425
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,875
noticed something was wrong.

426
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,166
-He broke through a window...
-[glass shatters]

427
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,208
...and saved
the editorial staff's lives,

428
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,291
who then thanked him
for his heroism.

429
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:11,041
As any self-respecting author
working here would know,

430
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,583
the Japanese word for "deadline"
can also mean "closed."

431
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,541
So, in this case,
"breaking the deadline"

432
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,750
had a double meaning,
since the author also "breaks"

433
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,291
the "closed" room open.

434
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,750
That's correct.
Good job, man.

435
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,000
Wow. And that was
a tough one!

436
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,250
[laughs]

437
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,958
A simple play on words
is nothing

438
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,583
to someone of my caliber.

439
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:30,000
-You're so amazing!
-Uhh...

440
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,458
If you've had
enough playing with words,

441
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:32,666
you can play with me!

442
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,791
I don't bite,
unless you're into that.

443
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:35,166
[ITSUKI]
No, thank you!

444
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,458
-[NAYUTA] Aww.
-[MIYAKO] Geez, Nayu!

445
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,000
You're like everyone's
drunk pervy uncle!

446
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,750
Ready to start?

447
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,708
[ALL]
Cheers!

448
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:48,875
[gulping]

449
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,583
Ah! So good!

450
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,208
Oh wow, you aren't kidding.

451
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,750
Mostly sweet with
the right amount of bitterness.

452
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,125
Just be careful.

453
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,291
It may go down easy,
but it's fairly strong.

454
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,875
Delicious.

455
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:02,375
You made all of this food
by yourself, Chihiro?

456
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,208
Oh, yeah.
That I did.

457
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,000
Ha! You know, Kanikou,

458
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,541
cooking is a really
valuable skill to have.

459
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,541
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

460
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,875
If it's so valuable, why don't
you know a thing about it?

461
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:15,333
I need motivation!

462
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,750
If I had a little sister
like Kobato from "Haganai"

463
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,250
or Komachi from "Oregairu,"

464
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,416
then I'd be making them
three square meals a day!

465
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,041
[NAYUTA]
I see your obsession influences

466
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,458
all aspects of your life.

467
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:26,208
Then what if you had
one of the meaner ones

468
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:27,583
like Kirino from "Oreimo"?

469
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,791
Would you cook for her too?

470
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,958
Oh, Kanikou,
you understand so little.

471
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,958
I'd rather her yell at me
and say something like,

472
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,291
"You can't even cook?

473
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:35,791
What a worthless piece
of garbage you are!"

474
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,250
Man, you're sick.

475
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,666
Then a little sister
can nurse be back to health!

476
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,750
[sighs]

477
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,125
I am stuffed.

478
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,458
I'm not.

479
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,166
But I bet we could fix that
if you'd let me have

480
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,875
that snake in your pants
for dessert.

481
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:52,500
-Uh... [coughing]
-[NAYUTA laughing]

482
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,875
Way too forward, Nayu.

483
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,250
You'll scare him off.

484
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,791
-[phone buzzes]
-Hmm?

485
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,000
[HARUTO]
I got a message from my editor.

486
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,083
Okay.

487
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:02,416
What?

488
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,583
Seriously?

489
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,750
Huh?

490
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,666
[ITSUKI]
They want a new manuscript?

491
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,333
No, all my stuff was accepted.

492
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,250
An anime-related problem
just came up.

493
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,291
And that means

494
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,666
I have to go see my editor ASAP.

495
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,625
Aww. Then you have to leave now?

496
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,041
Must be tough, huh?

497
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:21,708
Being good enough
to get an anime?

498
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:23,041
[chuckles]
Sorta.

499
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,291
Correct me if I'm wrong,

500
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:26,000
but that's gonna start
in April, right?

501
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,208
Sure will.

502
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:28,791
Just under three months away.

503
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,541
Honestly, I'm pretty excited.

504
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,541
Well, give it your all, man.

505
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,541
Back at ya.

506
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,500
[door closes]

507
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,625
[sighs]

508
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,166
I should probably
head home, too.

509
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,041
Oh. It's almost time
for the last bus!

510
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,583
[NAYUTA] All right,
guess I'll see you later.

511
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,291
Be careful getting home.

512
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,666
What are you going to do, Nayu?

513
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,416
I'm holed up in a nearby hotel,

514
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,125
so I'm going to stay
a little longer.

515
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,625
Get some private time.

516
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,875
You're not exactly holed up

517
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,750
if you're here
hanging out with us.

518
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,916
[MIYAKO]
Goodnight.

519
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,375
Thanks for dinner, Chihiro.

520
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,458
You're welcome.

521
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:04,583
Goodnight!

522
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:07,416
[giggles]

523
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,791
This is great.

524
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:11,791
We're finally alone,
like you always wanted!

525
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,458
You should really
get going, too.

526
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,291
Come on. Just think!

527
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,333
We could have quite
the naughty all-nighter.

528
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,875
-[sighs]

529
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,333
Huh? Hey.

530
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,666
What do you think
you're doing with that, minor?

531
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,041
Don't be such a downer.
A little bit won't hurt!

532
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:28,041
Not happening.
Stick to apple juice, kid.

533
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,166
[NAYUTA] I'm an adult,
thank you very much.

534
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,916
Not adult enough.
Give me that!

535
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,833
I promise I won't have
more than a sip

536
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,125
if you let it go now.

537
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,041
[BOTH grunt]

538
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,166
[NAYUTA gasps]

539
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,375
Well, that's one way
to get me wet.

540
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,208
Just go clean yourself up.

541
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:07,083
"Even if I don't have
a place in school,

542
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,166
the whole world lies
ahead of me"?

543
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,416
[inhales deeply]

544
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,208
[exhales]
Aah!

545
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,916
[NAYUTA] Oh, Itsuki.
I love you.

546
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,541
And yet you're only interested
in little sisters.

547
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,583
You're probably the most
perverted person I've ever met.

548
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,291
Get a good look in
while you can!

549
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:33,458
Until tomorrow.

550
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,791
Go do some work, you dummy.

551
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm in love.

552
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,333
With your work, Hashima.

553
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,583
-Why the pause?
-Why the pause?

554
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,708
-[gagging]
-Huh?

555
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,416
[NAYUTA retching]

556
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,875
[ITSUKI]
Ah, come on!

557
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,416
I still can't believe
she puked on me day one.

558
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,750
I'm sorry about what happened
the other night.

559
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,416
[laughs]
It's okay.

560
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,916
I'm not the kind of guy

561
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,166
who stresses about
the little things.

562
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,625
I like you.

563
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,750
I have ever since I started
reading your books.

564
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,666
I fell in love
with your words at once.

565
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,541
So, will you please
go out with me?

566
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,875
Uh... Uh...

567
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,375
Uh, well...

568
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,083
let me get back
to you on that one.

569
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,875
[sobbing] What should do?
What do I tell her?

570
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,583
I mean, I don't know
the first thing about this chick

571
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:46,500
aside from the color
of her puke!

572
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:47,791
A girlfriend can't just be hot,

573
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,000
she's gotta have
a good personality, too!

574
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,166
Oh.

575
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,000
So, this is her debut work.

576
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,291
[sighs]

577
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,666
Hmm.

578
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:22,666
[chuckles]

579
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,208
Huh?

580
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:30,416
Uh...

581
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,708
[sniffles]

582
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,416
This is on another level.

583
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:37,833
Well, then.

584
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,250
Guess I'll get back to work.
