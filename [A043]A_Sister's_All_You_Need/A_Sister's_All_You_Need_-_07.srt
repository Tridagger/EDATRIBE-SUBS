1
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:14,458
[typing]

2
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:33,666
[sighs]

3
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,166
The reviews and comments

4
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,875
for episode two are horrible.

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,583
And I doubt
it's gonna get any better.

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm completely done for.

7
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,625
Why did I even work
so hard on it?

8
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,250
And you have
to supervise it all.

9
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,750
As soon as we're wrapped,
I'm gonna need

10
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,416
some serious tabletop RPG time.

11
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,000
I got a job for you, Haruto.

12
00:00:59,083 --> 00:00:59,875
[HARUTO]
Huh?

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,458
I wanna play a TRPG,

14
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,875
so I need you
to be the gamemaster.

15
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,666
[HARUTO]
That came out of nowhere.

16
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been thinking about
trying one for a while now.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:10,458
And you seem like you have
the time on your hands.

18
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,625
[Haruto] Uh, I still have
quite a bit of work

19
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:13,750
on my plate, man.

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:16,041
Well, guess what?
I don't care.

21
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,791
[sighs]
All right.

22
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,041
Could be fun.

23
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,583
Not like I have a choice.

24
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:22,541
Cool.

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,458
We need more people,
so I'll text Kanikou,

26
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:27,208
Chihiro, and Miyako.

27
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,916
Sure.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,916
Sounds good.

29
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,583
Um, so TRPG stands for
Tabletop Role-Playing Game?

30
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,208
I can't say I've ever heard
of that before.

31
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,791
I've heard of the term,
but that's about it.

32
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,125
I've read a retelling
of a campaign before

33
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,166
but never actually
played anything myself.

34
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,166
Well, a TRPG is a game
where you advance

35
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,500
by interacting with characters
within a world

36
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,833
and roll a dice to determine

37
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,833
how your decisions
and actions pan out.

38
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,041
Each player creates
their own character

39
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,208
and participates in the story
presented to them.

40
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,416
Most of the events will be
determined by the GM,

41
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,833
or gamemaster.

42
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,833
But depending on what
the players choose to do,

43
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,000
the story could take a turn
that even the GM didn't expect!

44
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,500
Are we allowed to make
a character

45
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,833
that's completely different
from us in real life?

46
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,833
[HARUTO]
Of course.

47
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,166
Playing as someone different

48
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,458
is one of the biggest appeals

49
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,166
of any RPG,
but there's nothing wrong

50
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,083
with making your character
exactly like yourself.

51
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,250
Exactly like myself?

52
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,291
[HARUTO] The world for this game
is your typical one

53
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,666
of swords and magic.

54
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,541
You're all adventurers
who have just arrived

55
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,250
in a new kingdom.

56
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,166
With that out of the way,
let's create some characters.

57
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,708
I've taken the liberty
to make samples

58
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,333
of partially
predetermined abilities.

59
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,791
To make things easier,
we'll use them as templates.

60
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,416
[CHIHIRO]
Hmm.

61
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,958
[MIYAKO]
Hmm.

62
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,291
Hey, Fuwa?

63
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,208
I'm having trouble
understanding my sheet.

64
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,083
What does the "2D" and "3D"
next to our stats mean?

65
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,083
The "D" is for "dice."

66
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,125
You'll make various decisions
throughout the game

67
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,333
by rolling your dice.

68
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,916
The higher
the corresponding stat is,

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,041
the more of them
you'll get to use.

70
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,208
[MIYAKO] So then "2D"
means you roll two dice,

71
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,291
and "3D" means you roll three?

72
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,250
[HARUTO]
Exactly.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,333
Silly question.

74
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,458
But can we pick
whatever sex we want?

75
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,125
Sure can.

76
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,291
So does that mean you're gonna
make a female character too?

77
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,291
Wait, you're not going
with a guy either?

78
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,666
Her name is Tsukiko,

79
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,833
and she's a seventeen-year-old
female knight!

80
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,208
Well, if you're doing it,
I might as well do it too.

81
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,166
And while we're at it,
why don't I make my character

82
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,625
your character's little sister?

83
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:03,666
Her little sister?

84
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,708
So you'd be
my little sister then?

85
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,291
I guess there's no reason
for me to say no.

86
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,166
Good! 'Cause I'm making
my character

87
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,791
your little sister, too!

88
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,666
She'll be the youngest
of the bunch!

89
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,416
And her hobby is doing
naughty things with Tsukiko!

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,125
[ITSUKI] That's not a hobby,
that's a problem!

91
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,750
Is that against the rules?

92
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,166
[HARUTO]
Uh, not exactly, but...

93
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,208
Yeah, whatever,
do what you want.

94
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,750
Huh?

95
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,791
If you three are going
to be sisters on an adventure,

96
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,625
then I guess I might
as well be one, too.

97
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:33,166
I can make my age twenty,
like I am in real life,

98
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,916
and that'll make me
the oldest of the bunch.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,458
I like the idea of you
as an older sis.

100
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,625
[laughs]

101
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:39,875
Hold on a sec.

102
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,625
I'm your little sister?

103
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,083
[MIYAKO]
You would be, yeah.

104
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,958
I'm the little sister?

105
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,166
You're okay with that, right?

106
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,583
Considering your
freaky obsession?

107
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,583
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,875
I love little sisters and all,

109
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,041
but that doesn't mean
I actually want

110
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,000
to be one myself!

111
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,500
That's completely different!

112
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,625
Then do you want me
to make my character younger?

113
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,333
[grunts softly]

114
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,916
I guess this could work.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,375
Well, what do you know?

116
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,291
Five seconds of thought
and you're back on board.

117
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:07,625
You better take
good care of me, big sis.

118
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,416
You're playing
the part a tad cockier

119
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,416
than necessary.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,666
And let me gear up some music
for the opening.

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,833
-[phone beeps]
-There.

122
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,416
-[fanfare playing]
-Gagagia Kingdom:

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,708
a small domain that rests
on the edge of the continent.

124
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,666
Within its boundaries lie
many ruins and caves.

125
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,291
Countless adventurers
travel here

126
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,750
seeking treasure and materials
from the native monsters.

127
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,833
And now,
four adventuring sisters

128
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,500
have arrived in the kingdom.

129
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,000
Will fate be kind to them?

130
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,208
There's only one way
to find out.

131
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,875
End scene.

132
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,375
Now, please introduce
the characters

133
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:41,833
you've created to us all.

134
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,041
Okay, how about I start
since I'm the oldest?

135
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,291
My name is Miyako,
just spelled differently.

136
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,791
And I'm an expert
on attack magic.

137
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,125
I also have this
one particular special attack

138
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,708
where I can shoot coins
at a super high velocity.

139
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,625
I'm Tsukiko, the second sister.

140
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,500
I'm a female knight
with long black hair

141
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:00,166
who fights with her sword
and shield.

142
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,000
My special ability
is I can reproduce any weapon,

143
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,625
as long as I see it once.

144
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,541
[CHIHIRO]
I'm the third sister, Sen.

145
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,583
I'm a thief class
who uses bows and arrows

146
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:10,000
as well as knives to fight.

147
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,333
And I have the ability
to open treasure boxes.

148
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:15,791
I can nullify any magical attack
that touches my right hand.

149
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,083
Everyone is using skills
that I'm pretty sure

150
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,291
I've seen somewhere before,
is that okay?

151
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:22,875
It's not like our campaign
is gonna be made into a book

152
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,500
or an anime, so it's fine.

153
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,333
Well, in that case.

154
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:27,625
Last but not least,

155
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm the youngest sister,
Death Mask.

156
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,166
When I come in contact
with another's bodily fluids,

157
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,000
I can increase
their abilities tenfold.

158
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,708
[giggles]

159
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,375
Something tells me your skill
is gonna cause the most trouble.

160
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,708
All right,
let's start the story.

161
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,333
You've all arrived
at the castle town

162
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,958
in Gagagia Kingdom.

163
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,875
It's early afternoon,
and the main street

164
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,916
is bustling with people.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,125
Okay, team, what does
everyone want to do?

166
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,541
I say we go to the inn
and relax by exploring

167
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,416
each other's private parts,
eh, Tsukiko?

168
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,708
Ten seconds in?

169
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,250
[HARUTO]
Unfortunately, you've used up

170
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,666
all of your travel money
on your way here.

171
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,416
With what you have now,
you won't be able

172
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,708
to sleep at any inn.

173
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:08,875
[CHIHIRO]
Makes sense.

174
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,291
That just means
we'll have to find

175
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,666
a way to make money, right?

176
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,916
[MIYAKO] How do we
make money in this world?

177
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,083
[HARUTO]
If you go to the pub,

178
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,916
you can find some job listings.

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,416
Or you could go to some ruins

180
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,166
and find treasure.
Or defeat monsters.

181
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,041
Then exchange whatever
they drop for money.

182
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,208
You heard the man.
Let's head for the ruins.

183
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,625
Who knows what
we'll find in there?

184
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,541
Wouldn't working be a safer bet?

185
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:30,041
You're so busy discussing
what to do next

186
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,875
that you hardly noticed
the four men

187
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,041
that appeared before you.

188
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,916
They seem to be adventurers.

189
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,166
[chuckles]

190
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,333
Sounds like you ladies
are low on funds.

191
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,500
But we'd be happy to treat
all of you to some drinks

192
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:41,875
and a room, what do you say?

193
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,916
Whoa, what? Seriously?

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,416
[THUG cackles]
Of course.

195
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,458
How lucky are we
to run into such generous guys?

196
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,083
We accept your offer!

197
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,916
Hey! Let's think
about this, big bro--

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,541
I mean, big sister!

199
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,083
They obviously have
other intentions.

200
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,291
I shouldn't have
to tell you this,

201
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,708
but don't go with them.

202
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,208
Really? Are you sure?

203
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,125
Oh, come on, we just wanna show
you a good time, I promise.

204
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,791
How dare you trick me

205
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,875
with the intention
of doing lewd things to us!

206
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,791
[chuckles] What?
Are you going to try

207
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,458
and fight us, little girl?

208
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,250
[MIYAKO]
We don't have much other choice!

209
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,875
The four of us will have
to stomp you into the ground!

210
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:18,708
This might actually
be good for us.

211
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,791
If we beat them,
we can steal their money.

212
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,166
Color me surprised
that you're talking

213
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,083
about robbing
these dudes so casually.

214
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,208
Sen is more hardcore
than I expected.

215
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,375
Either way, you girls
have decided

216
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,875
to fight
these shady characters.

217
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:32,500
I'll make some
battle preparations.

218
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,500
Give me a sec.

219
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,083
This is Tsukiko.

220
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,791
-This is Sen.
-[CHIHIRO] Huh.

221
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,500
[HARUTO]
This is Miyako.

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,750
And this is Death Mask.

223
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,583
Why am I the old geezer?

224
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,625
All of their faces
are very stoic.

225
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,291
This is a western TRPG,

226
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,250
so we're gonna have to work
with what we've got.

227
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,500
These four are your enemies.

228
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,791
We'll take turns.

229
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,291
Order is determined by agility,

230
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,041
so highest goes first.

231
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,583
All right.
Let your battle begin!

232
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,458
[grunting]

233
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,333
[THUG laughs]

234
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,583
What's the matter?

235
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,708
Aren't you going to fight back?

236
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,166
I'll rip your clothes to shreds!

237
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,916
Ha-ha. Wide open.

238
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,750
[screams]

239
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,583
I've had just about enough
of you guys!

240
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,125
Ice Needle!

241
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,625
You won't beat us that easily.

242
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,041
Didn't work.

243
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,791
-[THUGS laugh]
-[ITSUKI] Damn, they're strong.

244
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,041
If we don't change things,
we're gonna lose.

245
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,500
Myaa, you know
what we have to do!

246
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:42,625
Are you ready?

247
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,958
Sorry, what?

248
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,458
I'll use my ability.

249
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:48,375
We'll power you right on up!

250
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,791
Then, you should be able
to defeat them

251
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,583
with one blast from your magic!

252
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,333
You can't fool me!
I know your ability

253
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,083
requires us
to do pervy fan service.

254
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,791
-No, thanks!
-[NAYUTA] Don't worry.

255
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,708
We just have to share
a little kiss.

256
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,000
[MIYAKO] Really? Well,
I guess that's okay then.

257
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,583
For the team.

258
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,958
-Then here comes the loving!
-[MIYAKO gasps]

259
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,500
[NAYUTA] Slipping past
my big sister's soft lips,

260
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,166
my tongue met hers.

261
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,791
The two twisted together
in a vulgar dance.

262
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,666
And unable
to help herself anymore,

263
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,291
Miyako lets out
an unstifled moan.

264
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,416
-[ITSUKI grunts softly]
-[MIYAKO moans]

265
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,708
I'm sensitive there.

266
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,291
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't fabricate

267
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:21,750
my character's reaction!

268
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,458
[NAYUTA chuckles]

269
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,000
[NAYUTA] You're so cute,
I could just eat you up.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,166
As I devour Miyako's tongue,

271
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,666
I gently untie
the strings of her robe.

272
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,750
"No, you mustn't."

273
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,958
I ignore my sister's
weak cries of resistance

274
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,583
and proceed to take off
her robe and underwear.

275
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:46,500
I strip naked myself,
and our bodies press together.

276
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,083
As she quivers,
partially in embarrassment,

277
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,125
but mostly from excitement,

278
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,166
I kiss her deeply.

279
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,583
She writhes in a fit
of her own pleasure.

280
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,750
You can feel it swelling up.
Can't you, big sis?

281
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,000
I aggressively attack

282
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,125
my big sister's
various weak spots.

283
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,500
To which she responds
with a chorus of sweet moans

284
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,000
each and every time.

285
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,083
Uh, what the hell
are we looking at here?

286
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:15,250
[MIYAKO/NAYUTA moaning]

287
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,625
-[SOLDIER] Hold it right there!
-[ITSUKI] Uh...

288
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,916
[HARUTO] Uh, a number
of soldiers head your way,

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,833
sporting armor and spears.

290
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,166
[THUG] Oh, no!
Let's get out of here!

291
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,541
[HARUTO] Fearing the soldiers,
the four opposing adventurers

292
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,458
decide to flee.

293
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,208
[ITSUKI sighs]
Looks like we're saved.

294
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,583
[HARUTO]
In your moment of relief,

295
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,208
the soldiers surround you.

296
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,750
[ITSUKI]
What?

297
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,750
[SOLDIER] You're under arrest
for public indecency!

298
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,125
You've got it wrong!

299
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,000
Me and my big sister here
were just performing

300
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,500
filthy, depraved acts
on each other

301
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:47,250
in the middle
of a public street!

302
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,875
Yes. Public indecency.

303
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,083
Oh, that's right.

304
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,833
I didn't agree to any of this!

305
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,041
[cell doors slam]

306
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,208
[MIYAKO cries]

307
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,666
I never thought
the day would come

308
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,875
where I'd be arrested

309
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,208
for public indecency
of all things.

310
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,875
What happened?
Where did I go wrong?

311
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,583
Well, we're certainly not
helping the situation by moping.

312
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,625
Let's put our heads together
and come up with a plan.

313
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:07,041
I've had enough of your plans!

314
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,458
-[WOMAN] Um, pardon me.
-[BOTH] Uh?

315
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,500
[ITSUKI] Huh?
Who the hell are you?

316
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm Silvia.

317
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:16,750
The princess of Gagagia Kingdom.

318
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,791
And I have come here to ask
a favor of you adventurers.

319
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,583
If you will do this for me,

320
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,166
I can promise you
an immediate release in return.

321
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:28,583
I don't see any other way out
at the moment.

322
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,083
Let's listen to her.

323
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,583
So in summary,

324
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,416
we just have to deliver
a letter to the sage

325
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,666
living in the forest?

326
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,916
We're like a delivery service.

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,583
Sounds simple enough to me.

328
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,958
I don't know.

329
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:41,833
Haruto's novels usually try
to surprise you

330
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,541
by taking mundane events
and turning the tables.

331
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,750
There's probably
something more to this.

332
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,416
Like, the princess is a villain
who's setting us up.

333
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,166
And the sage we're being sent to
is an evil wizard who'll use us

334
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,333
as sacrifices
to revive some nastier deity.

335
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,500
All right, that's enough!
Stop trying to predict

336
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,000
what's gonna happen in my story!

337
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,250
[snarling]

338
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,750
Looks like we've got company!

339
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,375
Are goblins high level enemies
in this world?

340
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,583
Good question.

341
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Perhaps someone could
use their wisdom

342
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,208
to figure that out.

343
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,333
Okay, then I'll do it,

344
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,916
since mine is the highest.

345
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,916
[HARUTO]
Success.

346
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,416
Goblins are one of

347
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,041
the weakest monsters
in the kingdom.

348
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,041
You should have no problem
defeating them.

349
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,833
Also, they're weak against fire.

350
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,041
Everyone ready?

351
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,666
Let's rip 'em a new one!

352
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,000
Yah!

353
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,666
Here comes a fireball!

354
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,375
[GOBLIN groans]

355
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,750
[chuckles]

356
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,750
[HARUTO] Since you
have defeated the goblins,

357
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,375
your journey continues.

358
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,000
Further in the forest,
you spot a beautiful, vast lake.

359
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:48,375
[NAYUTA]
Now that we've found this lake,

360
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,333
it'd be a waste
if we didn't go for a swim!

361
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:51,583
[ITSUKI]
Huh?

362
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,250
If we relax here for a bit,

363
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,750
are we gonna get
some health back?

364
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,041
[HARUTO]
Yup.

365
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,958
Then we should definitely
stay for a while.

366
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,083
I hope this isn't a trap
set up for us.

367
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,500
Oh, it'll be fine!

368
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
Besides, what could be
so dangerous

369
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,333
about such a pretty lake?

370
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,416
I've seen a lot
of shark thrillers

371
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,083
and monster movies
in my time.

372
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,875
And the first ones
to die are usually

373
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,750
the unsuspecting girls
in bikinis.

374
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,125
[screams]

375
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,291
[CHIHIRO] Yeah, I've noticed
a similar trend

376
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,541
in the campaign retellings
that I've read.

377
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,333
Something bad always
seems to happen

378
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,000
when the girls are showering.

379
00:15:24,083 --> 00:15:25,125
-[roars]
-[screams]

380
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,708
Oh, those ones?

381
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,375
Those games are based
on the Cthulu mythos.

382
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,875
You're in for a lot gore,
horror, and scenes like that

383
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,083
when you step into
that kind of world.

384
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,000
This game is
a peaceful fantasy though,

385
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,333
so nothing that dangerous
will happen.

386
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,750
[ITSUKI]
I don't believe you.

387
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,250
[HARUTO] Then why don't you
use your intuition

388
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,791
and roll the dice?

389
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,583
I think you can sense
if there's any danger or not.

390
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,041
Hmm?

391
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,708
[dice rattle]

392
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,041
[HARUTO]
Yup.

393
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,208
Now that you've had
a look around,

394
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,541
there's nothing to worry about!

395
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,708
[NAYUTA]
That settles that!

396
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,208
It's time to hop in the water!

397
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,625
Everyone ready to strip naked?

398
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,416
Oh, how am I not surprised?

399
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,666
Wait a second,
do I have to strip, too?

400
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,791
There is no need
to be embarrassed, Sen.

401
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,666
We're all family here,
remember?

402
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,208
[CHIHIRO]
I guess you're right.

403
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,500
You better not be thinking
anything weird.

404
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,166
[splashing]

405
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,833
Uhh...
[blows bubbles]

406
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,125
-That's when it happened!
-[gasps]

407
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,541
[roaring]

408
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,250
[screaming]

409
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,541
I told you this was a trap!

410
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,291
[HARUTO]
The creature that arises

411
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,958
from the water is the Roper.

412
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,916
It has a single eye
and multiple tentacles

413
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,250
protruding from
its cylindrical body.

414
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,166
I'm not gonna lose
to some stupid tentacles!

415
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,000
No.

416
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,875
No, don't do that.

417
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,875
Your slimy appendages
don't belong in there.

418
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,583
I don't have any of my knives.
What are we gonna do?

419
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:55,375
That's why I prefer magic!

420
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,958
Energy bolt!

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,541
Not a chance, monster!

422
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,791
I can't beat it alone
if it regenerates!

423
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:16,291
[chuckles softly]

424
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,000
Then it looks like
it's time for me to use

425
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,250
the ace up my sleeve!

426
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,166
Huh?

427
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,541
Unlimited...

428
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,166
Blade Wo-- just kidding.

429
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,416
I'll use my "Phantom Smith"
to produce a sword!

430
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,458
[grunts]

431
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,291
Thanks a lot, sis.
You saved me!

432
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:42,583
But why didn't you cut
yourself loose first?

433
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:43,708
[chuckles softly]

434
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,208
As your older sister,
I prioritize you.

435
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,833
Your safety comes first.

436
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,458
Big sister!

437
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,666
Yeah, uh, hello?

438
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,500
I'm your little sister too,
you know.

439
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,458
Why would I save you
from something you enjoy?

440
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,791
Well, if he won't save you,
then I will, Death Mask!

441
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,041
That's it.

442
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,541
Suddenly I'm in the mood
for some calamari.

443
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:16,333
[HARUTO]
Turns out you were wrong

444
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,750
about this place being safe.

445
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,291
But the lecherous Roper
has been defeated,

446
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,000
and you can relax
for real this time.

447
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:21,958
Good job!

448
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,166
You just had to insert

449
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,541
your weird tentacle fetish
somewhere,

450
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:25,500
didn't you?

451
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,708
[ITSUKI] So I guess
this is where the sage lives?

452
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,458
[NAYUTA] Yeah. It's literally
emitting evil smoke.

453
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,541
[MIYAKO] There are probably
traps everywhere.

454
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:36,250
But if we want to deliver
the letter,

455
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,208
we're gonna have to go
in at some point.

456
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,791
What's written
in that thing anyway?

457
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:40,958
Have we tried to read it yet?

458
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,625
No, because Silvia told us

459
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:43,875
we absolutely
can't look inside--

460
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,166
Just tear it open!

461
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,208
I'm down.

462
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,291
[grunts softly]

463
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,750
Fine.

464
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,791
This is what's written
on the paper.

465
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,625
"I'm delivering four young girls
to you as sacrifices.

466
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,500
Please accept them."

467
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,875
This is exactly
what I said would happen!

468
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:00,541
Well, then what are we
gonna do?

469
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:01,791
There's no sense in going in,

470
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,916
knowing we're just
gonna be sacrifices.

471
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,208
I agree with you.

472
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,083
So why don't we just burn
the mansion

473
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,416
to the ground instead?

474
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,541
Uh!

475
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:15,000
[tape fast forwarding]

476
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,125
[NAYUTA moaning]

477
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,500
-[explosions]
-[WIZARD screams]

478
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,166
[WIZARD]
Curses.

479
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,125
We were so close.

480
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,583
-It looks like I'll have...
-Shut up.

481
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,791
...to deal with you mysel--

482
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,041
[ITSUKI] Princess Silvia!
Give it up!

483
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,708
We've already put
a stop to your plans

484
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:39,250
to revive the evil deity
so you could take the throne!

485
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,583
It's over!

486
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:44,500
I thought you were just a bunch
of kids, so I let my guard down.

487
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,875
But I won't make
the same mistake twice!

488
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,791
[roaring]

489
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,083
You can't trick us
with your illusions!

490
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,041
It's a good thing I have more
than just magic at my disposal!

491
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,958
Roper's tentacles!

492
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,250
Huh?

493
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:05,125
Wait. What the hell
did you do?

494
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,625
[chuckles]

495
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,333
I can reproduce any weapon
I've laid my eyes upon.

496
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,041
And that includes
a monster's tentacles!

497
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,666
How dare you. Unhand me!

498
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,208
Please! I beg you!

499
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,541
Let me go this instant!

500
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,333
Oh, my!

501
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,291
Come on, Myaa,
while she's distracted!

502
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,166
This is our chance
to power you up!

503
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,458
That's not happening.

504
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,958
[HARUTO] And so the four sisters
successfully put

505
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:30,791
a stop to the conspiracy
that threatened the kingdom.

506
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,958
Our heroes can now get
some well-deserved rest.

507
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,000
This concludes our adventure.

508
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,958
[ALL]
Good work, everyone!

509
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,541
Nayu may have given me
a hard time,

510
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,458
but I'm glad
I tried TRPG.

511
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,750
They're so fun!

512
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,166
[CHIHIRO] Yeah. I'd like
to play one again.

513
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,500
I'm really glad
you had a good time!

514
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,791
It wasn't bad, but I didn't
get to power up

515
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,625
Itsuki's character even once.

516
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,375
I'll have
to try harder next time.

517
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,125
I would prefer it if you didn't.

518
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,875
[chuckles]
All right, well.

519
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,875
I'll start thinking
about our next campaign, then.

520
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,375
Looking forward to it.

521
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,625
And you need to start thinking

522
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,208
about learning
some self-respect.

523
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:07,708
[NAYUTA]
Oh, come on.

524
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,625
I didn't hear your character
complaining about it,

525
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:11,500
Miss One-Woman-Army.

526
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,875
-Thanks for this, Itsuki.
-Hmm?

527
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,083
What do you mean?

528
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,291
The game we played today,

529
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,250
it was all to cheer me up,
wasn't it?

530
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,583
Mmm. D-Don't get
the wrong idea, man!

531
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
I just had a sudden urge
to try a tabletop RPG!

532
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,791
-Yeah, that figures.
-[scoffs]

533
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,833
You know...

534
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:36,875
it's a lot of fun
to create something.

535
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,166
And it makes me happy when
people enjoy what I've made.

536
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,125
No matter how much
or how little.

537
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,583
I bet it's the same for them.

538
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:47,041
My anime team.

539
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,208
Sure, there some
rough times along the way.

540
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,875
And in the end,
it didn't pan out.

541
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:55,291
But the fact that we all
worked hard on this thing

542
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,291
wasn't a waste.

543
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,458
At least, I think.

544
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,541
So there's no reason
I should stop giving

545
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,250
a hundred percent now, right?

546
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,875
No, man.

547
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:12,166
Yeah.

548
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,000
-Hey, Itsuki?
-Huh?

549
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:35,125
Does Miyako have...

550
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,708
a boyfriend

551
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,750
or what?

552
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,958
Huh?
