1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,083
Oh.
It's you, Miyako.

2
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,083
Whoa, I hardly recognized you!

3
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,125
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

4
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:21,041
I just haven't slept
in a couple of days.

5
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,125
Anyway, you came
at the perfect time.

6
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,208
What?

7
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,708
[ITSUKI]
Could you do me a solid

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,833
and deliver this to my editor?

9
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,791
Thanks, you're the best.

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:33,000
-[thud]
-Itsuki?

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,166
Like hell you're fine,
you look terrible!

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,583
[snoring]

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,250
Man.

14
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,500
What am I going to do with you?

15
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,458
Do I just use this
to call him down?

16
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,875
Oh.

17
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:27,458
May I help you, miss?

18
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:30,041
Uh, yeah.
I was told to--

19
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,375
Uh, Itsuki Hashima asked me

20
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,583
to deliver something
to Mr. Toki for him.

21
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,291
Okay. Then why don't you
come in.

22
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,541
[YAMAGATA]
Delivery!

23
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,958
Hey, Ken-Ken!

24
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,000
You shut your mouth,
you little-sister obsessed

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,416
freak o' nature!

26
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,041
[snoring]

27
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,250
Is everything okay with him?

28
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,041
Happens all the time.

29
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,708
That messy one's his desk,

30
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,833
so why don't you just
leave it there for him?

31
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,208
All right.

32
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,208
[sighs]

33
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:01,750
[continues snoring]

34
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,625
He must be pushing himself
extra hard.

35
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,458
It's always like this
when proofreading day is near.

36
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,583
Really? Hmm.

37
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:15,875
Hey.
Isn't that...?

38
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,708
It's the cover for
Nayuta Kani's new volume.

39
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,708
Supposed to go
on sale this month,

40
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,958
but the manuscript
hasn't been turned in yet.

41
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:24,750
[MIYAKO]
Well, that's no good.

42
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,833
You can say that again.

43
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,291
And I haven't been able
to get a hold of her.

44
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,375
[sighs]

45
00:03:30,458 --> 00:03:32,458
[MIYAKO]
Um...

46
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,250
If you'd like,
I could check up on her.

47
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:36,291
[YAMAGATA]
What?

48
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,208
Yeah, I can go see her now.

49
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,208
Sorry.

50
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,750
But who are you?

51
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,666
Come on in, Myaa!

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,750
Now don't be shy,
take off your clothes!

53
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,416
[MIYAKO]
Uh... 'Kay?

54
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,625
Hold on, I am not here
to mess around, girl!

55
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:58,000
Aw, that's a shame.

56
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,791
Nayu, I heard you haven't
turned in your manuscript yet.

57
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,000
[squeals]

58
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,875
[MIYAKO]
I saw your editor and she said

59
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:06,375
she'd been up all night
waiting for it.

60
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,708
How much longer
do you think it'll take?

61
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:09,916
Um, I dunno.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,416
I'm almost done with the amount

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,041
I'm supposed to write.

64
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,333
But I just haven't been able

65
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,416
to keep myself
in the zone lately.

66
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,750
[MIYAKO]
In the zone?

67
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,500
We should totally have some fun!

68
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,166
I just know that I'll feel
more motivated

69
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,125
to get my work done
if you play with me.

70
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,166
No way.

71
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,291
Aww.

72
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:26,916
Hey. Don't be like that.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,375
We can hang out and do
whatever you want

74
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:30,000
when your work's done.

75
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,666
I guess you leave me no choice.

76
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,541
But I have one condition.

77
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,125
Let me use your lap as a pillow!

78
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,291
It'll recharge my batteries!

79
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,208
You're like my power cable.

80
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't even know
what that means.

81
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,666
But if you really think
it'll help

82
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,500
then I can deal with it.

83
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,875
C'mon.

84
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,875
[laughs]

85
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,625
Wait, you write it
on your phone?

86
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:54,958
Yeah, sometimes.

87
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,208
I just use whatever I feel
like at the time.

88
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,416
I'll use my laptop,
a stand-alone word processor,

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,958
or even paper and pencil.

90
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,458
Well that's convenient.

91
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:06,708
If you have to be naked,

92
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,250
I guess you're stuck
in this room

93
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,416
no matter what you use.

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,916
Yeah.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,166
But laying on your lap
is a good way to mix it up!

96
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,083
[MIYAKO]
You got me there.

97
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,500
Okay, enough messin' around.

98
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:18,125
Time to get to work!

99
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:19,791
[phone whirring]

100
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
Wow. You're fast.

101
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,625
Manuscript done and submitted!

102
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,291
Good job.
I'm proud of you, Nayu.

103
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,250
[laughs]

104
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,000
Thanks to you, Myaa.

105
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,708
You should be my editor
from now on.

106
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,916
You're great with motivation.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,583
Why are things not going well
with your real editor?

108
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,083
No, things are fine with her.

109
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,000
Then you should probably
keep her in the loop

110
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,500
on your work.

111
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,958
It's not like talking to her

112
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,000
makes me finish
my manuscripts any faster.

113
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,041
Hey, you don't know
that for sure.

114
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,333
Maybe if you actually discussed
your story with her,

115
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:55,500
she'd give you
some good ideas.

116
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,583
Hmm.

117
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,625
[giggles]

118
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,083
Nah, that wouldn't happen.

119
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,458
[sighs]

120
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,541
Okay.

121
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:08,458
Ah. What about the fifth line
on page twenty-one?

122
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,083
[YAMAGATA]
Seriously, you're a lifesaver.

123
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,666
Thank you so much.

124
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,375
Oh, I didn't do
anything special.

125
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,125
But we can release
the book thanks to you.

126
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,666
-[sighs]
-Wait, what's wrong?

127
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,208
Now I have to go apologize
to the printers,

128
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,958
the proofreaders,
and the marketing department.

129
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:27,125
Not the person who couldn't
make the deadline, but me.

130
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,708
I always get stuck
with this stuff.

131
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:30,708
[exasperated sigh]

132
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,750
I'm well aware that it's my job.

133
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,250
It's what I do.

134
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,250
I just hate getting
the runaround from a little girl

135
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,416
who just happens to be
our most valuable author.

136
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,875
So, um...
I'm guessing that you two

137
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:43,333
aren't exactly getting along
at the moment?

138
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,166
-We get along.
-[TOKI talking on phone]

139
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,666
But the two of us aren't
creating something together

140
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,250
like those guys are.
Understand?

141
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,375
Well, then maybe
you should talk more

142
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,000
about the content
of her stories.

143
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,583
-[YAMAGATA] No.
-[TOKI yelling]

144
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,166
[YAMAGATA] There's virtually
nothing anyone

145
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,333
could contribute
to better her works.

146
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,041
Even though I'm her editor,

147
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,208
I'm basically
just fixing her typos.

148
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,000
It's infuriating, honestly.

149
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,416
If it's so frustrating,

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
why don't you
just quit being her editor?

151
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,041
It's never crossed my mind
and it never will.

152
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,833
Are you sure?

153
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,166
Never?

154
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,500
Yes, I'm sure,
and I'll tell you why.

155
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:22,083
If I quit I wouldn't be the
first one to read her novels.

156
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,041
Then you must love her work.

157
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,916
That's nice to hear.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,833
[TOKI]
Wait. Yeah. Okay. Fine.

159
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:30,250
I hate to admit it,
but you're right.

160
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,416
[TOKI]
Okay. Aaah!

161
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,250
Ah!
Damn it, shut up for a sec!

162
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,166
We're getting nowhere
over the phone like this!

163
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,958
I'm coming to your place
right now!

164
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,375
Stupid kid.

165
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,458
[TOKI growls]

166
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,250
If I had to do what he does,
I'd be angry too.

167
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,666
[HARUTO]
All right.

168
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,000
In celebration
of our dear friends

169
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,541
Itsuki and Nayu
releasing new volumes,

170
00:07:56,625 --> 00:07:58,250
we toast!

171
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,000
[ALL]
Congratulations!

172
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,583
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you, Myaa!

173
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:04,500
So thank you very much!

174
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,000
Did Miyako help you out?

175
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,583
Um?

176
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,541
Yeah. She got na--

177
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,875
I just hung out
and kept her company.

178
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,416
Okay.

179
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,875
You know, now that I think
about it,

180
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,041
Kaiko thanked you
for helping her too.

181
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,500
What did you do?

182
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,750
It was nothing!

183
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,666
Seriously, don't worry about it.

184
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,000
Now let's drop it
and if you bring it up again,

185
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,166
I'll break your collarbone.

186
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,916
Why so specific?

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,250
Now I'm even more curious
what she did.

188
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,958
[ITSUKI sighs]

189
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,916
It's nice to be able
to take my time eating

190
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,791
now that
I'm done working.

191
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,708
Yeah, I try not to eat too much
before a deadline, too.

192
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,416
Don't wanna get tired
and fall asleep.

193
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,583
[NAYUTA]
Same here.

194
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:47,583
What do you mean?

195
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,833
You never worry about deadlines.

196
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,875
Well, sure I always
finish my work on time,

197
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,416
but I get tired
when I eat too much.

198
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,875
So I can imagine what it's like

199
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,958
to do that the night
before a deadline.

200
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,958
In other words,
you've never done that.

201
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,791
[chuckles]

202
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,208
[sighs]

203
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,583
Okay. Now that
we're all relaxed,

204
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,083
what do you say
we play a game?

205
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,166
Yeah. Good idea.

206
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,083
What did you have in mind?

207
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,583
Huh...

208
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,125
How about Once Upon a Time?

209
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,666
[whistle blows]

210
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,166
[HARUTO]
Once Upon a Time is a game

211
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,000
in which all players
are storytellers,

212
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,583
creating a story, together.

213
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:29,541
Each player has an ending card
that has,

214
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,000
you guessed it, the ending
to their story on it.

215
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,791
They also have
a number of story cards

216
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,625
that are used
to build their plot.

217
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,666
The first player to use up
all of their story cards

218
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,833
and complete the story
with their ending card

219
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,416
is declared the winner.

220
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,791
Now pay attention,
'cause this part's important.

221
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,291
If any idea from one of
your story cards comes up

222
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,875
while another storyteller
is speaking,

223
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,291
you can present your card

224
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,833
and steal the position
of storyteller from them.

225
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,083
Oh, I get it.

226
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,750
So you want it to be your turn,

227
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,000
because that means you can take
the story in a direction

228
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:59,083
that uses your cards
and ends with your conclusion.

229
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,166
[HARUTO] There's also an
interrupt card that can be used

230
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,375
when a similar type
of story card is presented

231
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:06,250
letting a player immediately
steal the turn for themselves.

232
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,666
So be prepared for that.

233
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,500
[ALL]
All right. Okay.

234
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,041
You ready?

235
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,291
Let's decide who goes first
with rock-paper-scissors.

236
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:15,833
Cool.

237
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,833
Looks like I'll be treating you
to a new story

238
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,291
free of charge.

239
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,375
Once upon a time,
there was an older brother

240
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,375
and his ever-faithful
younger sister.

241
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,333
[HARUTO]
Of course you got that one.

242
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,750
Are we sure we shuffled?

243
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,333
This is divine intervention

244
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,125
telling me to make
a sister story.

245
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,416
I don't even need to say this,
since it's implied,

246
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,041
but the little sister
is young and beautiful.

247
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,500
Yes!

248
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,708
That makes me the storyteller!

249
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:43,000
I didn't expect the first player
to be interrupted so quickly.

250
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,541
[ITSUKI groans]

251
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,125
[HARUTO]
When the storyteller changes,

252
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:47,875
the player who was interrupted
has to take

253
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,208
a new story card from the pile.

254
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,416
[ITSUKI groans]

255
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,791
The little sister
was very beautiful.

256
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,750
But unfortunately,
someone put a curse on her

257
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,666
and she was turned into
a not-so-beautiful wolf.

258
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,958
Huh?

259
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,000
Why you gotta ruin
the sister like that?

260
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,750
The one who turned
the little sister into a wolf

261
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,791
was a very cute
and completely naked witch.

262
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,458
Her name is Kaniko.

263
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,583
[laughs]

264
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,458
The witch showed herself
and spoke.

265
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,166
She said, "I've always
loved you from afar!

266
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,708
"If you marry me, I'll return
your little sister to normal.

267
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,708
You wouldn't abandon her,
would you?"

268
00:11:19,916 --> 00:11:21,041
Come on!

269
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,708
Then the older brother thought,

270
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,166
"She cares so much about me

271
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,708
"and she's so adorable, too!

272
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,000
She's the perfect woman."

273
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,041
And so, the two
fell madly in love.

274
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,291
Go back home to your
little sister, man!

275
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,708
Hold on.

276
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,958
I think I can use this
interrupt card, right?

277
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,166
[laughs]

278
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,750
And that makes me
the storyteller now.

279
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,208
Let's see.

280
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,458
As promised, the witch
returned the little sister

281
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,000
to her natural form.

282
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,250
As an unforeseen side effect,
the big brother realized

283
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,083
he liked her better
than the witch.

284
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,958
[NAYUTA]
This guy's a cheating jerk.

285
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,541
[ITSUKI]
Yes! Atta boy, Chihiro!

286
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,125
[CHIHIRO]
Then the big brother said,

287
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,875
"Kaniko, let's get a divorce.

288
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:02,291
I love my little sister
far too much to be with you."

289
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,416
Kaniko and the older brother
got in a huge argument,

290
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,875
but eventually, she understood
how deep their bond

291
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,583
as siblings was,
and let them be.

292
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:13,625
And so, the two
were able to return

293
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:16,125
to their once peaceful lives.

294
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,791
And then they, uh...

295
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,750
[HARUTO] If you can't think
of a way to continue the story,

296
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,166
you can pass.

297
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,458
[CHIHIRO]
Okay. Yeah, then I pass.

298
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,750
[HARUTO]
The storyteller position

299
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,625
is now given to the player
on your left.

300
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,541
[NAYUTA]
Yes, that's me!

301
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,625
Though the witch
had withdrawn once, deep down,

302
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,208
she knew she just couldn't
accept these circumstances.

303
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,791
[whimpers]

304
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,041
The longer the witch witnessed

305
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,166
them living happily together

306
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,875
the greater her hatred grew.

307
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:42,250
Until one day she
put a curse on them both!

308
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,333
Grow, swell, rise!

309
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,875
Your monster
will stretch sky high!

310
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,333
The witch's magic made
the big brother's dick

311
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,958
over a meter long,

312
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,333
and both of them
completely nekkid forever!

313
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,541
Oh no!

314
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:56,791
Talk about a terrifying curse.

315
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,625
That definitely qualifies Kaniko
for the position of evil witch.

316
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,708
And I've got just the card.

317
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,750
You misunderstand, this is
but a tragedy born of love.

318
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,166
Making this guy's dick a meter
long is not an act of love!

319
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,375
Now then.

320
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:11,833
The witch hid herself,
and to find her,

321
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,250
the siblings searched the land,

322
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,208
or in other words,
went on a journey.

323
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:17,333
So they're on a journey naked.

324
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,375
I guess so.

325
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,958
Then it happened.

326
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,875
Out of nowhere,
one of the witch's creatures

327
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,833
appeared before them
to block their path!

328
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,875
The two ran with
all their might.

329
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,333
While naked.

330
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,041
[HARUTO]
As they both retreated,

331
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,166
they hastily stumbled
upon a cave.

332
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,625
While naked.

333
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:34,958
The two headed in,

334
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,791
safely out of reach
of the giant creature.

335
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,041
With nowhere to go,

336
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,791
they traveled deeper
into the darkness.

337
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,416
While naked.

338
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Yes, while they were naked!

339
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,000
Where was I?

340
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,750
In the dark depths of the cave,

341
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,250
they found a shining holy sword.

342
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,250
[NAYUTA]
My turn!

343
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,041
The big brother thought
he might be able

344
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,416
to fight off the creature
with this golden sword.

345
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,291
However, he couldn't
swing it properly

346
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,333
due to his new, gargantuan
giggle stick getting in the way.

347
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,791
It was at that moment that the
creature found them in the cave

348
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,291
and reached in,

349
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,041
hoping to catch them
before they were too deep.

350
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,041
This was now
a life-or-death situation.

351
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,208
But the big brother
didn't give up.

352
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,625
"Of course!" he spouted,

353
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,208
"Even if I can't use
this holy sabre,

354
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,666
I can still fight with
this mighty sword of my own!"

355
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,750
[clang]

356
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,500
Dude.
You're kidding, right?

357
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,416
[NAYUTA]
Schwing!

358
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,541
The big brother took hold
of his erect pocket rocket

359
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,791
and wielded it like a sword!

360
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,208
What the hell?

361
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,833
[NAYUTA] Bestowed
with the power of magic,

362
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,666
the big brother's dick
could act as a sword,

363
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,291
grow over three meters long,

364
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:33,041
and could even function
like a whip

365
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,625
if the situation called for it.

366
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,208
"Thank you, Witch Kaniko!"
he shouted

367
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,208
as he flew past
the big-ass trees.

368
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,166
He aimed his mighty weapon
for the creature's weak point!

369
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,875
Isn't it the witch's fault
they're being attacked

370
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,125
in the first place?

371
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,583
I think...

372
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:49,333
I can interrupt
with this card now, right?

373
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,916
[NAYUTA]
Oh, it's finally Myaa's turn

374
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,541
to be the storyteller.

375
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,000
This is a really embarrassing
place to pick up.

376
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,375
Maybe I should have waited.

377
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,833
[NAYUTA]
Don't be shy,

378
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,333
just tell us what happens
in the battle

379
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,458
between the big brother
and the giant!

380
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:03,916
Okay, well...

381
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,125
the big brother, he, uh,
wielded his mighty...

382
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,208
you know, and...

383
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,708
He what?

384
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,958
I couldn't really hear.

385
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:16,125
Well, I said
he wielded his mighty...

386
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,875
sword dick.

387
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,458
That's it, say it again
but louder this time!

388
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,833
Big brother wielded
his mighty...

389
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,291
He wielded his mighty sword dick

390
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,125
and he used it
to attack the creature!

391
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,000
Are you happy now?

392
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,791
Very much so, thank you, Myaa.

393
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:33,041
Okay.

394
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,333
The creature was defeated
by the attack

395
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,083
and fell to the ground.

396
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:38,583
The two siblings then continued
their journey to find the witch,

397
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,916
unimpeded.

398
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,166
While naked!

399
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,375
[CHIHIRO]
And so the journey

400
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,333
of the naked siblings continued.

401
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,000
The big brother fought against
many of the witch's minions,

402
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,166
as well as bandits
and adventurers.

403
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,000
Along the way,
he gained notoriety

404
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,916
as a, um, dick swordsman.

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,791
He defeated ruthless titans
and evil dragons,

406
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,416
and even won a duel
against the ultimate

407
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,625
dick swordsman, Musashi.

408
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,750
He wielded two dick swords,
so beating him was a big deal.

409
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,041
The king of the kingdom handed
over his throne to the brother,

410
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,541
and the siblings lived
happily together.

411
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,791
The witch that had cursed them

412
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,958
finally admitted defeat

413
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,458
and apologized for her actions.

414
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,166
The big brother
forgave the witch,

415
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,166
and the two,
plus the younger sister,

416
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,458
formed the first polyamorous
ruling family.

417
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:19,708
The three lived happily,

418
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,375
and nakedly,
for the rest of their days

419
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:24,166
in the kingdom that would come
to be known as Nudist Land.

420
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,875
And that's the story of how
this once-normal kingdom

421
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,458
came to have such a strange,
peculiar name.

422
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,541
[ALL sigh]

423
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,458
It's finally over.

424
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:38,750
Yeah.

425
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,250
Somewhere along the way,
I stopped caring

426
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,791
whether I was gonna win.

427
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
We made a pretty awful story.

428
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,250
Yeah, but all the foreshadowing
worked out

429
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:48,333
and it did get kind of
exciting here and there.

430
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:51,166
Especially the part with his
Omni-Erectional Movement Gear.

431
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,333
I guess I do feel a little
accomplished for making a story.

432
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:57,041
And can you imagine turning this
into an anime?

433
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,541
Dude, they'd never
be able to air that.

434
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,083
Oh yeah, obviously.

435
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:04,333
And we all know who to thank
for creating dick sword.

436
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,708
Oh.

437
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,375
[laughs]

438
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:09,458
Oh. Is it that late already?

439
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,541
Sorry, everyone,
I gotta go home.

440
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,083
[MIYAKO]
Oh, yeah.

441
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,833
I'm going to miss the last train
if I don't go, too.

442
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,625
I'm gonna hang
and drink some more.

443
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,208
You be safe. 'Kay?

444
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,875
I don't have the energy
to go back to my hotel.

445
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,750
So I'm gonna sleep right here.

446
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,708
[crashes]

447
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,708
She's wiped from
playing around so much.

448
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:29,875
That kid.

449
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,416
[HARUTO]
Hey, Itsuki?

450
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,875
[ITSUKI]
Yeah?

451
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:40,625
Why don't you just go out
with Nayu already?

452
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,833
Where did that come from?

453
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,583
She's quite the catch,
that girl.

454
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,541
She's cute, funny,
got a good figure,

455
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,958
and on top of that,

456
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,083
she's a perv.

457
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:52,958
You know I already
turned her down,

458
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,208
like forever ago, right?

459
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,166
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

460
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,166
You could say I have my reasons.

461
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,916
Such as?

462
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,458
Nothing I feel comfortable
telling you.

463
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,166
Then why even bring it up?

464
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,625
And why do I have to go out
with Kanikou for your reasons?

465
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,583
That's a really weird thing
to say.

466
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:10,833
What do you mean?

467
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,291
You like Nayu, right?

468
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,708
No, not really.

469
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,666
Where the hell'd
you get that idea?

470
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,958
Hmm.

471
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,666
Stop being so stubborn.

472
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,583
You like her, right?

473
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,708
Then go out.

474
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,958
What the hell's up
with you, man?

475
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,125
You're being pushy.

476
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:32,291
Guess I am.

477
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,833
[whimpers softly]

478
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,208
All right, fine, I admit it.

479
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:51,625
I like Kanikou,
just like you said.

480
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,791
Okay, then.

481
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,166
I'm crazy about the girl.

482
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,833
I'd even marry her.

483
00:18:57,916 --> 00:18:59,000
But not yet.

484
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,000
I just can't.

485
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,625
What do you mean by that?

486
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,083
Hypothetically,

487
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,125
and this is
strictly hypothetical.

488
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,708
Let's say Kanikou
and I got married.

489
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:09,666
What happens then?

490
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,291
Your honeymoon.

491
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,916
Shut up, man.

492
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,041
If Kanikou got married,

493
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,833
the publishers would
lose their minds.

494
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:18,625
No question.

495
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:22,083
It might even end up
in the paper or on the news.

496
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,958
[HARUTO]
Well, she is a popular

497
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,458
18-year-old author.

498
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,208
[ITSUKI]
And you can bet the headlines

499
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,833
would be terrible.

500
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,750
"Super Popular Female Novelist
Nayuta Kani Gets Married!"

501
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,833
"She married a man
two years older than her

502
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:36,291
in the same profession."

503
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,125
Yeah, you're right,
I hadn't thought about that.

504
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,916
Which means...

505
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,916
no one would think of me
as Itsuki Hashima.

506
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,458
I'd end up a supporting
character in her life.

507
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:52,083
I would just be some writer
who was married to Nayuta Kani.

508
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,208
I don't think
I could handle that.

509
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,291
I want to be the protagonist.

510
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:05,833
That's why.

511
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:08,291
Right now, I'm quite
literally a nobody.

512
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,541
But if I can become a writer
who's equal to Kanikou,

513
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,875
then you can bet your ass
I'd tell her I like her myself.

514
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:18,208
I kinda feel bad.

515
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,916
But I need her to wait
until then.

516
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,291
That makes sense.

517
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,166
Well, what can you do?

518
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,166
[chuckles]

519
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sure it's nice

520
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,333
but there are more
important things

521
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,041
than messing around
with a cute girl.

522
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,333
Aren't there?

523
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,333
But I'm curious.

524
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,208
What exactly do you mean
by being equal to her?

525
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,083
You wanna beat her in sales?

526
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:45,000
or get some literary award
that she doesn't have yet?

527
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,500
I dunno.

528
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,583
But for now,
I'm gonna at least

529
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,375
try to become
someone more significant

530
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,708
if we ever decide
to get married.

531
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,875
Getting an anime would be a good
first step towards that,

532
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,166
you know?

533
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,083
An anime's just the first step?

534
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,333
Yeah, maybe to you.

535
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,250
You aim high, man.

536
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,541
But still.
You're right.

537
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,875
Considering your
eventual goal here,

538
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,000
an anime's just a checkpoint.

539
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,541
[ITSUKI sighs]
Exactly.

540
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,208
[HARUTO]
Man, this is good.

541
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,375
[ITSUKI]
Yeah, dude,

542
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,208
good call on
the beer and sausages.

543
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,708
[HARUTO]
Speaking of which,

544
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,916
I want to go to Germany,
or Belgium someday.

545
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:54,333
This girl is
insanely talented.

546
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,666
[phone buzzes]

547
00:22:58,708 --> 00:22:59,666
Yeah?

548
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,833
[TOKI]
Itsuki.

549
00:23:00,916 --> 00:23:02,500
I have something
I have to tell you.

550
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,875
What?

551
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,833
Was there an emergency reprint
or something?

552
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,333
[TOKI]
Oh, you knew about that?

553
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,583
Wait.
Really?

554
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,208
[TOKI]
Yeah, for Kani's new volume,

555
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,833
not "Mahou Academy."

556
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,375
Oh.

557
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,666
The amount of copies you guys
printed for her new book

558
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,000
is already higher

559
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,083
than all of
"Mahou Academy"'s combined.

560
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:21,666
[TOKI] And she's so popular,
even that wasn't enough.

561
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,791
Did you just call me so you
could brag about her sales?

562
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,333
[TOKI]
No, sorry.

563
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:30,500
I should probably
congratulate you.

564
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,916
"Mahou Academy" has been
greenlit for an anime.

565
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,958
[ITSUKI shudders]
