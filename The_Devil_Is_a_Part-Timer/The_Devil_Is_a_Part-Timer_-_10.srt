1
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,333
Yesterday sure
was rough, huh?

2
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:24,166
But we can't stop
busting our humps now,

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,041
otherwise Sentucky Fried
Chicken might steal

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,916
all our customers again.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,416
[KISAKI] I have to go
tell Corporate about

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,166
our eighty percent sales drop.

8
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,708
No way we wanna freeze our
butts off in Greenland, right?

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,291
[MAOU shivers]

10
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,166
[KISAKI] Hey, Maa.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,375
[MAOU yelps]

12
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,708
I want you to help out
another restaurant.

13
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,291
No!

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,250
Please don't do this to me, I
made our sales goal plus some,

15
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,125
just like you said!

16
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,125
What?

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:47,375
It's a fun place.

18
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,875
Besides, you're
not in trouble.

19
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,916
My friend manages the Hushimaen
store and wants to borrow

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,375
one of my best workers.

21
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,208
Oh, that makes sense.

22
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,208
Don't thank me just yet,
that joint's gonna be

23
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,708
out of control busy.

24
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,833
The park is opening a bunch of
new rides and attractions, so,

25
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,166
we'll cover all your expenses
and give you a small bonus

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,375
for your trouble.

27
00:01:04,458 --> 00:01:05,833
So yeah-- Think you're
up for the job?

28
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,125
Of course, ma'am.

29
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,666
[CHIHO] Oh oh!
Can I go with?

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,708
That's all right.

31
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,333
They can manage
without you.

32
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:12,250
[CHIHO] Aw.

33
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,833
But I wanna.

34
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,833
[KISAKI] I'm counting on you,
Maa, you're my top crewmember...

35
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:17,250
[CHIHO] Hushimaen, huh?

36
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,500
[MAOU] You got it!

37
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,041
[ASHIYA] Oh?

38
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,208
Tomorrow you say?

39
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,625
[MAOU] Yep.

40
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,458
[slurp]

41
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,708
You're eating
too much too fast,

42
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,833
and you're not
fully recovered.

43
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:02,666
Ease up, or you'll
make yourself worse.

44
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,958
[ASHIYA] Sire...
[swallows]

45
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,375
The noodles will expire any
day now, we have to consume

46
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,166
as many of them
as we possibly can.

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,458
But thank you very
much for your concern.

48
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:13,625
[URUSHIHARA] She's right.

49
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,333
The amusement park
near that other MgRonald's

50
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,458
is reopening tomorrow, and
they're rolling out a bunch

51
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,875
of cool attractions, so it
looks like they're expecting

52
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,250
a big crowd.

53
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,666
Quit surfing on the interwebs
and start helping us...

54
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,125
--...slurp down some noodles!
--[URUSHIHARA] Whoa.

55
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,666
They got a wicked new
reptile exhibit there!

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Dude!

57
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,541
Over three hundred
different species.

58
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:31,250
Sounds like you'll
be busy, Sire.

59
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,333
Yeah.

60
00:03:32,416 --> 00:03:33,666
[URUSHIHARA] Whoa!

61
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,125
The new Haunted House
is supposed to be scarier

62
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,708
than Labyrinth of Shocks!

63
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,291
And everyone says that's the
scariest one they've ever seen.

64
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:41,958
[URUSHIHARA] So if a whole
bunch of people are going to

65
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,458
a crazy-scary Haunted House,
that means there's probably

66
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,666
gonna be a butt load
of concentrated fear

67
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,083
ripe for the taking.

68
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,958
[URUSHIHARA] You
could get some magic.

69
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,916
[ASHIYA] Then I
shall assist you.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,250
I will be there to watch
over you with true zeal.

71
00:03:58,333 --> 00:03:59,541
Don't worry, Sire.

72
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,500
With me by your side,
nothing can go wrong.

73
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,250
[URUSHIHARA] Wait.

74
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,625
You're going, too?

75
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,208
[ASHIYA] Yes.

76
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,458
It's my duty.

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,583
You stay at home and
try not to burn the place

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,083
to the ground.

79
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:11,958
[ASHIYA] Now what?

80
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,083
[URUSHIHARA]
Want pizza.

81
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,083
Gimme money.

82
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,375
[ASHIYA]
Absolutely not.

83
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,958
Such extravagance is not
allowed in this house.

84
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,583
You will eat these noodles,
and that is the end of it.

85
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,750
You will then
wash the dishes.

86
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,583
[URUSHIHARA] Dude, no.

87
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:23,958
How old are those noodles?

88
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,083
They have got to be turning
a little south by now.

89
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:30,041
Taste perfectly
fine to me.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,041
Do not waste them;

91
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,458
there are starving
children somewhere.

92
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,583
Yeah whatever, Mom.

93
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:37,583
[ASHIYA] Fine!

94
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:39,041
I'll have to
finish them myself!

95
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,166
[MAOU] Will you two stop
fighting and hurry up and eat?

96
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,666
We gotta get this done!

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,708
[symphonic ringtone]

98
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,291
[EMI] Hello?

99
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,541
Hey, Chiho; what's up?

100
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,875
Oh.

101
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,208
Yeah.

102
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,291
An amusement park, huh?

103
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,583
Sure, why not?

104
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,083
I've got the day free tomorrow.

105
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:57,916
Awesome.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,541
It should be a lot of fun.

107
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,083
And thank you so much.

108
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,583
I'm glad you're
coming along, Miss Yusa.

109
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,583
Going by myself might
have been kinda weird.

110
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,375
Cool!

111
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,125
I'll meet you there, then!

112
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,666
I wish I coulda gone with
Mister Maou, but oh well.

113
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,458
[CHIHO giggles]

114
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:20,666
[symphonic ringtone]

115
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,083
Hello?

116
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,875
[SUZUNO] The Devil is traveling
to Hushimaen tomorrow;

117
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm certain he plans
to collect magic.

118
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,083
What?

119
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,875
I thought he was helping
at another MgRonald's?

120
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,416
I see word has already
reached you then, Emilia.

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,250
Yeah, Chiho told me.

122
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,875
I'm going to take the train
up there tomorrow, too.

123
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,416
She wanted some company.

124
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,750
And that doesn't make any
sense, how can he collect magic

125
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,250
at an amusement park?

126
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,666
What do you think he's up to?

127
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,666
You're too trusting,
you know.

128
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,958
A healthy amount of suspicion
might do you some good.

129
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,333
It would be prudent if
I joined you at this park.

130
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,583
Yeah, whatever.

131
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,250
And I'll let Chiho know
you're tagging along,

132
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,333
so she isn't caught off guard.

133
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,250
[SUZUNO] The Hero trusts him.

134
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,625
But why?

135
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:06,333
[MAOU] Hi, my name's
Sadao Maou!

136
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:08,875
I'm from the Hatagaya store,
and I'm here to help out today.

137
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,166
Good to meet you all!

138
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,125
Kisaki's told me
quite a bit about you.

139
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,625
Says you're one
of her best.

140
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,041
I'll do everything
I can to live up to

141
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,458
your expectations, ma'am!

142
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,625
Great.

143
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,333
Today's gonna be a
super busy day people,

144
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,416
so bring your 'A games!'

145
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,666
[MAOU] Yes, Ma'am!

146
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,833
[CHIHO] Miss Yusa!

147
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,916
[EMI] We're late, I'm sorry!

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,750
Oh. No big deal.

149
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,708
How are you,
Miss Suzuno?

150
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,250
I've no complaints
to speak of.

151
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you for asking.

152
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,416
Though I am a bit concerned;
this is my first time

153
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,833
at an amusement park.

154
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,916
I do hope you will teach
me the ways of "fun."

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,750
Of course,
I'd be happy to!

156
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,166
[CHIHO] All right
girls, let's go!

157
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,333
Two Special
One-Pound burgers with

158
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,833
secret sauce ready to go!

159
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,250
[CHIHO] Whoa!

160
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,250
Miss Yusa, you look like
such a grown-up in that suit!

161
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,541
Two small burgers,
piping hot and ready!

162
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,708
So, I've
got to ask.

163
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,625
Ask what?

164
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,916
It's just--
You're sixteen.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,708
Aren't you?

166
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,125
[CHIHO]
I sure am!

167
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,375
[EMI] Life's
not fair.

168
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,125
[CHIHO] Was it
something I said?

169
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:18,833
[EMI] No!

170
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,500
You're just so
huge-- Cute.

171
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,125
I meant to say
'cute', 'cute.'

172
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,750
Wow, thanks a lot.

173
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,625
[CHIHO] I just hope
Mister Maou will think so, too.

174
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,875
[SUZUNO] I am prepared.

175
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,375
So let the
fun commence.

176
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,000
What ails you two?

177
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,583
[MAOU] Thanks,
have a wonderful day.

178
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:44,958
Next customer, please.

179
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,333
What would you like?

180
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,541
Two orders of nuggets,
extra barbeque.

181
00:07:48,625 --> 00:07:50,083
Add a side of mustard!

182
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,458
One iced latte.

183
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:52,750
One hot mocha.

184
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,750
Two small burgers,
one all the way.

185
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,541
One no pickles,
no lettuce, please!

186
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,458
Thank you, come again.

187
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
Nice job Maou.

188
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,875
All righty,
who's up next?

189
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:06,583
Hey!

190
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:07,750
Chi!

191
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,916
Hi, Mister Maou,
how's it goin'?

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,291
Um, I'd like to order three
Big Mig meals, if that's okay.

193
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,166
Of course, here at
MgRonald's we aim to please.

194
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,458
[CHIHO] Thanks.

195
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,958
[MAOU] Three
Big Mig combos!

196
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,833
I came to hang out
at the park.

197
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,125
[MAOU] Oh cool.

198
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,041
Good luck with the crowd;
you're gonna do amazing!

199
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,416
Yeah, thanks.

200
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,833
So um.

201
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,208
Do you like it?

202
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,666
Like what?

203
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,125
Ahhh...

204
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,333
Well, this store's
definitely a lot busier

205
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,250
than the one
we work at.

206
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,375
The customers
never stop coming.

207
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,208
So it's been good
practice for me.

208
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,875
Uh yes, of course.

209
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,416
[MAOU] What doesn't
kill you, amiright?

210
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,333
[CHIHO] Uh yes, of course.

211
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,125
I shoulda seen this one coming.

212
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,000
[EMI] You really are clueless.

213
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,833
[MAOU] What are
you two doing here?

214
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,083
Well, last time I checked
we hardworking office ladies

215
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,625
are free to do whatever we
want to on our days off.

216
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,833
Yeah, great.

217
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,083
I have not come here
seeking pleasure.

218
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,916
I'm here to learn
how people have fun.

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,416
Yeah, great.

220
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,541
[toilet flushes]

221
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,125
[ASHIYA groans]

222
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,833
[URUSHIHARA]
Are you gonna croak?

223
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,416
Not gonna lie,
you look like dookie.

224
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,083
No, I'm fine.

225
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,458
Nothing I
can't handle.

226
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,333
[URUSHIHARA] If I were
you, I'd take some meds.

227
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,041
It's just a
stomach ache.

228
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,833
I don't need
alchemy.

229
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,375
[ASHIYA] I'm so ashamed.

230
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,125
I intended to assist King Satan
in his collection of magic

231
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,583
and now look at me.

232
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,250
I'm such a disgrace.

233
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,041
Truly pathetic.

234
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,375
[URUSHIHARA] Take it
easy, stressin' out

235
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,125
only makes it worse.

236
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,791
Seriously, you're already
stuck at home anyway.

237
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:49,041
Either just stay in
there, or stay in bed.

238
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,041
[ASHIYA cries out]

239
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,041
[toilet flushes]

240
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,750
[URUSHIHARA] Dude.
Don't die, 'kay?

241
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,541
Wow, this place
is like crazy crowded.

242
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:59,583
I know, it's like everyone
and their mom's here

243
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,791
to check out all
the new stuff opening.

244
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,750
You mean like that
haunted house over there?

245
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:04,583
[CHIHO] Yep!

246
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,583
I hear it's pretty intense!

247
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:07,375
[EMI] So.

248
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,458
Should we go get in line?

249
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,583
[SUZUNO] Yes, let's.

250
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,500
[URUSHIHARA] You
could get some magic.

251
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,500
[SUZUNO] I have several
reasons to be interested.

252
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:21,000
[GIRL screams]

253
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,458
Let's go, girls.

254
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:45,125
Wait.

255
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,750
Awww...

256
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,833
[CHIHO shivers]

257
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,416
[CHIHO screams]

258
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,833
--[EMI] Chiho?
--[SUZUNO] Good Chiho?

259
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,250
[CHIHO screams]

260
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,583
[EMI] Wow, she
really took off.

261
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:09,833
Wimp.

262
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,916
I suppose we should
venture on without her then.

263
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,750
[EMI gasps]

264
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,958
[shivers]

265
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,666
[grumbles]

266
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,250
--[SUZUNO] Chiho, is that--?

267
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,333
--[crying]
--[SUZUNO] Chiho, is that--?

268
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,500
--[crying]
--[SUZUNO] No, not her...

269
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,125
--[crying]
--It appears to be someone else.

270
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:25,875
[SUZUNO] Hello?

271
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,583
Are you all right?

272
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,333
Child?

273
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,791
Why are you crying?

274
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,291
[GIRL] She's gone.

275
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,250
[SUZUNO] "Gone"?

276
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,250
Who's gone?

277
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,750
[GIRL] My momma.

278
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,083
[SUZUNO] Where is she?

279
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,291
[GIRL] She's gone.

280
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,541
All right.

281
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,083
Would you like
to come with us then?

282
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,666
[GIRL] She's gone.

283
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,000
My momma.

284
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,625
She's gone. She's--she's gone.

285
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,458
She's gone, my momma.

286
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,791
She's gone, gone...

287
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,875
Hey.

288
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,125
Wait.

289
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,125
[distorted voice]
It's-- It's Momma.

290
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,583
[SUZUNO and EMI scream]

291
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,958
[GIRLS sobbing]

292
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,041
[EMI] What sicko
thought that up?

293
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,000
[SUZUNO] This did not fit
with my understanding

294
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,208
of what you call 'fun.'

295
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,416
[SUZUNO] Shall we
give this a chance?

296
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,000
Uh.

297
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,208
Hey Chiho?

298
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,916
It's not too late
to turn back.

299
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,833
Uh... No.

300
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,458
I'll go in if
you guys will!

301
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,541
Kay.

302
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,583
Though I really
don't mind not going.

303
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,708
No.

304
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,291
We've come too far
to chicken out now.

305
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,041
Yeah, right.

306
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,333
Perhaps you're the one
who's a bit afraid, Emi.

307
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,250
Me? Please!

308
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,208
I just don' like
reptiles, that's all!

309
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm not a big
fan, either.

310
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,041
[CHIHO] Huh?

311
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,166
[squirms]

312
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,166
It's so gross how they
come creepin' in outta nowhere.

313
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,291
Yeah gross is right.

314
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:05,250
[EMI breathes heavily]

315
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,083
[growls]

316
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,916
I hate 'em with
a fiery passion.

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,583
Totally.

318
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:15,041
[SUZUNO] Still--it appears they
have a rather large variety.

319
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,416
I do hope they're edible.

320
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,041
Wait.

321
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,458
You said edible.

322
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,958
You like to
eat reptiles?

323
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:20,708
Yes.

324
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,541
They're delicious.

325
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,416
What?

326
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,083
When have you
done that?

327
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,375
[SUZUNO] Oh, many times.

328
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:27,333
But my first was on
a journey to the South.

329
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,708
[CHIHO] South of where?

330
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,250
[SUZUNO] A persuasive
acquaintance of mine told me

331
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,750
I would deeply regret it if I
did not sample the lizard so

332
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:34,166
I was left with no alternative.

333
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,583
[CHIHO] I woulda said 'no!'

334
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,750
[SUZUNO] I did protest at first,
but she was so adamant

335
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,250
about how tasty it was.

336
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:40,083
[CHIHO] Oh, yuk!

337
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,625
I can't even.

338
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,458
[SUZUNO] The inn prided itself
on serving every single part

339
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,541
of the lizard, from the
head all the way down

340
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,041
to the tip of the tail.

341
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,958
I have to admit, the Lizard Tail
Soup was truly wonderful.

342
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,500
[CHIHO gags]

343
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,250
[SUZUNO] The broth was salty and
rich, and the chunks of tail

344
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,666
were quite delectable.

345
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,458
Grotesque to look at,
but honestly I think

346
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,541
it's Ente Isla's finest dish.

347
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,458
So remarkable!

348
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,916
[screams]

349
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,375
Why are you telling
her about Ente Isla?

350
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,541
Have you lost your mind?

351
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:07,791
I've misstepped.

352
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,583
[MIZUSHIMA] Hey, Maou?

353
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:11,500
Ma'am?

354
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,625
When you're
finished with those,

355
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,916
can you make some
in-park deliveries?

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,125
Ma'am!

357
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:40,708
[WORKER] Whup!

358
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:41,291
[WORKER] Oh.

359
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,583
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:43,375
No.

361
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:44,791
It's completely my fault.

362
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:46,375
Please,
not at all.

363
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:49,416
What's up?

364
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,875
You're cute,
Miss Yusa.

365
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,291
Oh you!

366
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,416
[MAOU] MgRonald's delivery!

367
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,458
I have your order!

368
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,333
Great, we've been
waiting for you!

369
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,208
Would you mind bringing
that inside please?

370
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,916
[MAOU] Just give us a call if
you need anything else, okay?

371
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,166
[CHIHO] This is way cool,
I had no idea there were

372
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,083
so many different
types of reptiles.

373
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,833
Neither did I!

374
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,166
Well?

375
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,750
Do you recognize anything
you've eaten for dinner?

376
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,333
Quiet.

377
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,833
I prefer not to think of them as
food while they're still alive.

378
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,375
Look, it's
a monkey.

379
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,916
Perhaps
it's lost.

380
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,333
Why is it
wearing clothes?

381
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,458
Hey there.

382
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,333
Don't be afraid; come on out.

383
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,250
[CHIHO gasps]

384
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,416
[EMI] Yeah.

385
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,250
I don't think
I like this monkey.

386
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,291
[MAOU] Thank you
for choosing MgRonald's;

387
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:50,625
we'll see you next time!

388
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:51,458
[MONKEY TRAINER] Wait.

389
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,625
Sadao!

390
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,833
Sadao?

391
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,625
[MONKEY TRAINER]
Yeah, he's my monkey!

392
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,208
A monkey, huh?

393
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,791
Sadao!

394
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,958
Stupid monkey.

395
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,416
Come on!

396
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,083
[MONKEY TRAINER]
Hey, Sadao!

397
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,750
[MONKEY TRAINER]
Here, boy!

398
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,583
Where'd you go?

399
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,333
[MAOU] Uh.

400
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,583
Here Sadao!

401
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,458
So, what do you think
we should do with him?

402
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,916
Could we take him to the
Lost Children Center?

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,583
[MONKEY TRAINER] Sadao!

404
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,791
Sadao!

405
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,541
You know it's not safe for
you to run off on your own

406
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,791
like that, buddy!

407
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,416
[MAOU] Oh, you
found him, great!

408
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,333
Yeah!

409
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,916
[CHIHO] Mister Maou!

410
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,583
Chi!

411
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,458
What's up?

412
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:29,208
Thanks, Miss,

413
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,291
you're a lifesaver!

414
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,000
So this little guy's
name is Sadao, huh?

415
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:33,875
[MONKEY TRAINER] Yep!

416
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,625
[SUZUNO] Were you lost, Sadao?

417
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,958
[CHIHO] I tell ya what, you sure
are one lucky monkey, Sadao.

418
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,333
[MONKEY TRAINER]
My Sadao has a real weakness

419
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,291
for the ladies.

420
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,208
He's a full-blown problem child!

421
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,458
[EMI] Yeah.

422
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,250
And clearly your Sadao
is a fan of "big'uns."

423
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,083
[CHIHO]
"Big'uns"?

424
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:47,750
[EMI] Never mind.

425
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,583
That's enough!

426
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,375
Just let it go already!

427
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,333
[EMI] Bump!

428
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,416
[CHIHO] Set!

429
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,041
[SUZUNO] Spike.

430
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,000
[WOMAN yelps]

431
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,500
[WOMAN screams]

432
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,333
[EMI] What's that?

433
00:17:35,416 --> 00:17:36,791
[CROWD screams]

434
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,291
[PARK ANNOUNCER]
I have an urgent message

435
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:39,708
for all guests.

436
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:43,000
Alligators have escaped
from the reptile exhibit hall...

437
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,250
Chiho!

438
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,041
Everyone please try
to remain calm!

439
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,333
Don't get separated
from your children!

440
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,750
Oh gosh, you okay?

441
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,250
Yeah.

442
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,083
[PARK ANNOUNCER]
Everyone, please follow...

443
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,666
Suzuno?

444
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:28,666
[MAOU in Ente Islan]

445
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:37,916
[MAOU in Ente Islan]

446
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,125
[CHIHO] Emi...
[MAOU in Ente Islan]

447
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,458
Mister Maou's using
his powers, isn't he?

448
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,750
[EMI] Apparently.
[MAOU in Ente Islan]

449
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:55,875
[MAOU in Ente Islan]

450
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,041
[SUZUNO] I don't understand.

451
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:06,541
He could've taken advantage of
the chaos and absorbed its power

452
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,958
for personal gain.

453
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:10,750
But instead he's being selfless;
using what he collected

454
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,583
to help the humans.

455
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:14,541
King Satan, Ruler of Demons.

456
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,833
What is going on in your head?

457
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,708
I gotta say, Maou,
you did even better than

458
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,208
Kisaki said you would.

459
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,333
Thank you, ma'am.

460
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,083
Just doing my job.

461
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,375
Well, then.

462
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,208
I've still got clean up duty
so I'd better go.

463
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:33,958
Bye, Chi.

464
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll catch you later on.

465
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,041
[CHIHO] See you
at work tomorrow!

466
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,875
[EMI] Well, Maou
conveniently bailed.

467
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,958
Yeah kinda.

468
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,875
I was worried today
might be a disaster,

469
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:46,375
but it turned out alright.

470
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,000
It was worth it seeing
Mister Maou like that!

471
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,291
I guess so.

472
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,375
Plus, I got to spend a
gorgeous day having a blast

473
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,208
with two really
amazing people.

474
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm so lucky to have
friends like you!

475
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,666
Yeah.

476
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,500
Pretty good times,
all things considered.

477
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,458
Right?

478
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:01,375
Yes.

479
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,916
This was fun.

480
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,791
[CHIHO] Miss Suzuno?

481
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:58,791
[URUSHIHARA] So what's up?

482
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,541
Did you get any magic yesterday?

483
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,958
Hm.

484
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,041
Hard to say whether I got
some or just used some up.

485
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,791
[URUSHIHARA] Huh?

486
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,333
[ASHIYA] Urushihara
is a fool.

487
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:12,125
Nothing he says is to be relied
upon under any circumstances.

488
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,416
Oh, Sire.

489
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I am so very sorry for
interrupting your meal.

490
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,458
I'm so rude.

491
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,416
I kinda hurt just
lookin' at you.

492
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,083
[ASHIYA] I am in pain,
true, but I shall recover.

493
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,458
[URUSHIHARA] Oh,
he just ate too much!

494
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,333
Silence, rogue!

495
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,250
Do not mock me!

501
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,250
Stupid legs fell asleep!

502
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
--[MAOU] One second.
--[URUSHIHARA] Wait.

503
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,875

--[URUSHIHARA] No. Come on...!

I got a delivery

505
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,833
for Mister Hanzo Urushihara.

506
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,541
What, really?

507
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,208
[ASHIYA] "Jungle dot-co."

508
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,416
[URUSHIHARA] Uh. Well you see.
This is uh--

509
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,041
This is what?

510
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,583
Cough it up!

511
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,208
What did you do while I was
in the bathroom, you little--

512
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,125
[MAOU] Maybe you
should see a doctor?

513
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:54,916
[ASHIYA] No.

514
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,958
No need.

515
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,875
It's only a bug.

516
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:57,958
[URUSHIHARA]
You sure about that?

517
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:58,958
[ASHIYA] Quiet, you!

518
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:00,416
[ASHIYA] Wretched
little twerp.

519
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,458
You worrying
makes me feel worse!
