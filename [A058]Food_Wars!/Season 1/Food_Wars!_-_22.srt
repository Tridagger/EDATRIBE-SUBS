In other words, I'm sure you
figured out...

2
00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:11,033
one of us is gonna
go on to become the
next member of The Ten.

3
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:14,366
[URARA]
The top contestants from
each block will earn
the right to move on

4
00:00:14,466 --> 00:00:18,200
and compete in the
actual tournament event!

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,366
That means just eight finalists!

6
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:23,833
28 points!

7
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,333
31 points!

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:26,566
6 points!

9
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,933
[MEGUMI]
<i>No way...</i>

10
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>All those dishes</i>
<i>were really well done!</i>

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,900
[URARA]
Nao Sadatsuka has 84 points!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,933
So, Hisako Arato's score is...

13
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:38,700
92 points!

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
(Cheering)

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,166
This is so insane!

16
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:45,000
That's why Miss Erina has
chosen her to be her aide!

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,466
[URARA]
And now, Miyoko Hojo
takes the stage!

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,466
What will her score be?

19
00:00:51,566 --> 00:00:53,600
There we have it!

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,166
87 points!

21
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:59,300
She overtakes Nao Sadatsuka
to grab the second spot!

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,633
A boluo‐curry fried rice
rich with the aroma of spices
and pineapple

23
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,066
that linger in my mouth.

24
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:07,333
Oh god! I love just
thinking about it...

25
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:12,366
I can still taste the sweetness
of the fruit mixed with the
saltiness of the fried rice!

26
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:17,200
It's reminiscent of sweet
and sour pork, which also
uses pineapple.

27
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
To finish it off,

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,266
she hollowed‐out a pineapple and
then placed the rice inside.

29
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,900
Then, she re‐covered it
and baked it in the oven.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,333
She was even careful to salt
the areas the rice would come
in contact with

31
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,833
so as to not become
overly sweet.

32
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:35,266
By doing that, she was allowing
the fragrance to come out

33
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:37,666
and not diminish the rice's
moisture in any way.

34
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:41,500
[ORIE]
This was another step
forward in the history
of Chinese cooking.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,166
[ANDO]
She demonstrated
unparalleled talent.

36
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:46,266
And it manifested in the form of

37
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:49,500
someone with the skill to have
tamed the dragon's heat...

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,633
The Iron Dragon Girl!

39
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:55,766
<i>True to form for the daughter</i>
<i>and heir to Chinatown's</i>
<i>leading restaurant!</i>

40
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:00,766
<i>It was a striking blow</i>
<i>to everyone, enough to</i>
<i>feel great shame!</i>

41
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:05,666
Incredible! I never thought
curry could be made to
make you feel that way!

42
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,607
[AOKI]
OH! Hurry up!
Judging's about to start!

43
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:54,307
[SATO]
Oh man! Looks like things are
in high gear over here too!

44
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:55,440
Yeah!

45
00:04:04,073 --> 00:04:06,273
You can cut the tension
with a knife.

46
00:04:06,373 --> 00:04:07,540
Sure is quiet
in here.

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,607
[SATO] HUH?!
[AOKI] Zero points?!

48
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,873
What the heck?!

49
00:04:10,973 --> 00:04:12,573
How can you get
zero points?!

50
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,307
Hmph.

51
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,307
(Cheering)

52
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,073
[URARA]
86 points!

53
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:21,073
Oh wow! Talk about an
attack from behind!

54
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:24,040
Yuki Yoshino was able to
capture the third spot!

55
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,173
Right now, Hisako Arato
dominates the top spot

56
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:29,440
with 92 points.

57
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,240
Coming up in second place
is contestant Miyoko Hojo,

58
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,740
with Yuki Yoshino in third

59
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,373
and Nao Sadatsuka in fourth.

60
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:38,240
[KITA]
I tell ya what, girl!

61
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,307
Your wild game curry was
a masterpiece, far exceeding
my expectations today.

62
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,040
I'm glad. Thank you for
the compliment, sir!

63
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,873
[KITA]
You made that stock with
fried duck fat and spices.

64
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,440
The fat imparted a duck flavor
to all the ingredients.

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Normally, that would give it a
gamey smell, but...

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,573
this scent is so inviting!

67
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:59,407
It's brimming with the aroma
of the wild!

68
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,473
And the finishing touch is
unreal!

69
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:03,173
You topped it with
a duck cutlet!

70
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:06,873
You've used turmeric
and other spices to
perfectly mask the smell

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,840
and give it an
orange‐like scent.

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,440
Oh and speaking of that,

73
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,473
duck a l'orange is a classic
French dish, is it not?

74
00:05:13,573 --> 00:05:17,173
Yes! I mixed in the fruit
and it's rind to the sauce.

75
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:21,140
It really matches that special
garam masala, doesn't it?

76
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,207
Ah, yes.

77
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:26,373
Fall is indeed the season
for wild game hunting...

78
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:30,273
Still, acquiring meat
of this quality for use
in the Selection

79
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,373
would require a direct line
to a wild game hunter.

80
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:38,207
Young lady, I invite you
to the next meeting of
my culinary club!

81
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:39,773
Huh, really?!

82
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,473
That's so kind of you!

83
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,940
[KITA] (Laughs)
Think nothin' of it!

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,773
<i>Even her adorableness is</i>
<i>whetting the appetite.</i>

85
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:52,207
[FUMIO]
Yuki, the innocence of
your smile draws everyone
into your orbit.

86
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:55,740
And your food is a straight
and honest shot to the heart.

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,140
You're just like...

88
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,107
the Little Red Riding Hood of
the Wild Forest!

89
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,707
The wait is over!

90
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,140
Next up is the must‐see
competition of...

91
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,007
The Aldini brothers!

92
00:06:10,107 --> 00:06:12,673
First is the youngest
Aldini‐ Isami!

93
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,273
Looks like it's my turn.

94
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,940
Good luck...

95
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
[ISAMI]
Please, judges, eat
while it's still hot.

96
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,707
Oh, what is this?
Did he make us a curry calzone?

97
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:24,440
The Italian Calzone.

98
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,840
Pizza dough that
has been folded

99
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,640
and stuffed with a
variety of ingredients.

100
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,607
In Italy it can be
either baked or fried,
depending upon the region.

101
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:33,907
Usually you find this
sort of pizza dish

102
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,807
filled with
mozzarella cheese and
other ingredients.

103
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,373
But that's just the... OHH!

104
00:06:39,473 --> 00:06:40,907
It's filled with curry!

105
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:44,107
Making this indeed an
Italian‐style curry bread!

106
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,507
Well look at this!

107
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,473
This is by far a
different approach

108
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,740
from what we've
seen thus far.

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,007
Interesting!
Well, let's try a bite!

110
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:53,807
Ohohoho!

111
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:56,173
I‐is there tomato in this?

112
00:06:56,273 --> 00:07:00,440
The depth and juiciness
of the tomato permeates
the entire curry!

113
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,973
You are correct, ma'am.

114
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,473
The only liquid used in that
curry was from tomatoes.

115
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:09,073
No. You used only tomatoes,
with no added water to your
innovative dish?

116
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:12,907
Yes. I laid all the tomatoes
in a pot and applied heat,

117
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:15,407
which released all the
moisture I could need.

118
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:20,107
I added a special spice
blend suited for the
acidity of the juice

119
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:24,440
to bring out the umami
of the tomato, producing
a deep, rich curry.

120
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,607
The dough was baked using our
house‐made grape yeast starter.

121
00:07:28,707 --> 00:07:30,640
[ANDO]
<i>The surface is nice and crispy.</i>

122
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,973
<i>The texture becomes sweet</i>
<i>the more you chew.</i>

123
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:36,273
<i>It produces the perfect harmony</i>
<i>with the depth of the curry!</i>

124
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,873
This is splendid!

125
00:07:37,973 --> 00:07:39,973
Uniting the Japanese
idea of curry bread

126
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:42,473
to make a new kind
of Italian cuisine!

127
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,173
(Crowd oohs and aahs)

128
00:07:44,273 --> 00:07:46,840
<i>The only thing anyone ever</i>
<i>thought about Isami Aldini...</i>

129
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,807
was that he was most likely
just riding the coattails
of his older brother.

130
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:52,607
<i>But that's not true.</i>

131
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:57,207
<i>He has chosen to head</i>
<i>down uncharted territory</i>
<i>all on his own...</i>

132
00:07:57,307 --> 00:08:01,873
<i>He's an explorer</i>
<i>of flavor horizons!</i>

133
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:05,207
<i>I am going to beat my brother.</i>
<i>Once and for all!</i>

134
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,407
[URARA]
And Isami scores...

135
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:09,707
87 points!

136
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:11,707
He's in second place!

137
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:14,173
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
He's tied with Miyoko!

138
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:17,707
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Looks like Nao is kicked out of
the running for the finals.

139
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:20,340
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
What is she laughing for?

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Maybe she's in
shock or something.

141
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,507
Big Sister Miss Hisako!

142
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,173
It is a dead heat!

143
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,840
It's only fitting that
competition be fierce at
an event this big!

144
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,740
Now then, moving forward,
is Takumi Aldini!

145
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:35,107
Buon appetito.

146
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:38,107
Oh, the next dish
is pasta, is it?

147
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,073
Two Italian dishes competing
back to back.

148
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,940
[ORIE]
There's bacon, green peppers,
mushrooms...

149
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,307
This is like
Spaghetti Neapolitan,

150
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,340
but with curry sauce instead
of traditional tomato sauce,

151
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,307
and the pasta is closer to
a fettuccine cut as well.

152
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:56,807
Aside from that, nothing
really pops out as
significant. Hmm.

153
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,607
That calzone earlier was
so unique and flavorful

154
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:04,173
that this doesn't appear
very promising for‐

155
00:09:04,273 --> 00:09:07,240
<i>What in God's name is causing</i>
<i>this amazing depth of flavor?!</i>

156
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,173
<i>It's like a lightning</i>
<i>bolt to the senses!</i>

157
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:12,973
[ANDO]
<i>The stock uses beef shank</i>
<i>and chicken carcass,</i>

158
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:16,040
<i>with fennel and green cardamom</i>
<i>added as aromatics.</i>

159
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,273
<i>This splendid curry sauce</i>
<i>tantalizes the nose!</i>

160
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:23,040
<i>It binds itself perfectly to</i>
<i>these wide‐cut noodles!</i>

161
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,907
Is there soy sauce
in this dish?!

162
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,173
It's not... It's tamari!

163
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,440
[ANDO]
It's produced mainly
in the Tokai region.

164
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,873
The flavor is more concentrated
than normal soy sauce,

165
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,640
and it's known for being
uniquely sweet and mellow.

166
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,673
I'm getting something else.

167
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:40,573
The smoothness of some
cheese embedded inside!

168
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:42,073
Allow me to explain.

169
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:44,273
Please look at the noodles'
cross‐section.

170
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,740
Oh! What is this treat?

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,640
The pasta has three layers!

172
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,273
The surface layers are flavored
with turmeric,

173
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:55,440
while the middle layer is softly
filled with the exquisiteness of
parmesan cheese.

174
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,773
I see...

175
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:58,240
The mixture of tamari
and parmesan

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,040
create an unusual
richness of bold flavor!

177
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,007
I don't understand.
When you added cheese,

178
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:07,007
the heat from boiling
the noodles would have‐

179
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,207
<i>That's why he went</i>
<i>with three layers!</i>

180
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:13,407
<i>Sandwiched by outer layers,</i>
<i>the cheese inside would seep</i>
<i>into the pasta!</i>

181
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:17,440
[ANDO]
<i>The tamari reinforces the depth</i>
<i>of flavor in the curry sauce.</i>

182
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,907
<i>The richness of the</i>
<i>parmesan cheese spreads</i>
<i>perfectly on the tongue</i>

183
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,140
<i>and drives the point home.</i>

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,507
<i>The technique of steeping soft</i>
<i>cheeses in soy sauce is well</i>
<i>known,</i>

185
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:30,607
<i>but to think parmesan</i>
<i>cheese and tamari would</i>
<i>go so well together!</i>

186
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,707
It is like a whole new
genre of cooking.

187
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:37,473
Bringing forth Italian and
Japanese styles with curry
as its heroic vessel.

188
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,107
[ORIE]
Takumi Aldini...

189
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:46,007
The Man who Carves out
new Flavor Horizons!

190
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:48,740
(Cheering)

191
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,340
[GUY]
Don't get me wrong.
They're both talented,

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,573
but I think Takumi has
a little more finesse.

193
00:10:53,673 --> 00:10:57,173
I would like to request
that YOU make our main
dish tonight, Takumi.

194
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,140
Is that ok?

195
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,940
[ISAMI]
<i>I can cook too, you know!</i>

196
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,773
Isami! Why did you alter a
dish that was already completed?

197
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,807
[FATHER]
You muddled the flavors.

198
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,440
Do you want our customers
to lose faith in us?!

199
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,040
(Sobbing)

200
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,073
Brother, I'm sorry.

201
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:20,873
I ruined your cooking.
I didn't mean to. I promise.

202
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:24,040
<i>I was just trying to show</i>
<i>that I knew how to cook too.</i>

203
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,207
<i>I didn't want to</i>
<i>be a burden to him.</i>

204
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,173
The mezzaluna:

205
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:31,840
The knife named
after the half‐moon.

206
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,407
It suits us perfectly,
don't you think?

207
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,607
When two halves come together,

208
00:11:38,707 --> 00:11:41,240
it forms something complete.

209
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,573
To be Aldini means the two of
us side‐by‐side, Isami!

210
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm trying to get better
as a chef so that you
can grow with me.

211
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,173
Then one day, our
restaurant is sure to be

212
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:55,740
the best establishment
in all of Italy!

213
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,407
Buon giorno!

214
00:11:57,507 --> 00:11:59,707
And welcome to Trattoria Aldini!

215
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:01,507
Ciao, Aldini brothers!

216
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:03,207
Looking forward to
some great food!

217
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,173
Countin' on you!

218
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,473
[ISAMI]
<i>Usually he's more laid back,</i>

219
00:12:07,573 --> 00:12:11,373
<i>but when he puts on his chef's</i>
<i>jacket, it's like he's a</i>
<i>different person.</i>

220
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:14,807
<i>Once again, I couldn't</i>
<i>keep up with him.</i>

221
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:18,040
Yeah. Sure enough,
my brother is incredible.

222
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,940
[URARA]
Takumi Aldini scores 90 points!

223
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,440
Grazie!

224
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,273
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Someone else was able
to score in the 90s!

225
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:28,807
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Oh, man!
He even beat Miyoko!

226
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:30,307
(Whimper)

227
00:12:32,307 --> 00:12:34,707
B Block is reaching
the final stretch.

228
00:12:34,807 --> 00:12:36,540
Remaining chefs,
will you pl‐

229
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,240
Here you go!

230
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,440
<i>What is she doing?!</i>
<i>Don't ever interrupt</i>
<i>Urara's commentary!</i>

231
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,007
<i>Don't make me hurt you!</i>

232
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:46,340
I was kind of getting
tired of waiting.

233
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,540
(Gasps)

234
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,973
Wh‐wh‐what the heck
am I looking at?!

235
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,107
[SCHOOLGIRL]
What IS that?!

236
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,640
[SCHOOLBOY]
Is that really food?

237
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,373
I put my very soul into this.

238
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:57,173
Well, please eat up and enjoy!

239
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:00,607
The twins on this
package are supposed
to be us, yeah?

240
00:13:00,707 --> 00:13:02,607
How... nostalgic...

241
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:04,640
This photo is from
1990...something.

242
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,740
Don't tell people
how old we are!

243
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,840
[BOTH]
Yeah, we have got
to change this box.

244
00:13:14,438 --> 00:13:16,958
[URARA]
What? Um, this dish
looks so strange?

245
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,691
Can this really
be considered curry?

246
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:22,591
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Is that spiral thingy edible?

247
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:25,124
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
The sauce is a weird
green color too.

248
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:27,724
There doesn't seem to be any
roux present in that dish.

249
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,324
Um... you don't know what
you're talking about.

250
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:31,924
Make no mistake:

251
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:34,658
Everything on that
plate is curry.

252
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:40,758
(Grunts)

253
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,191
What's going on?

254
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,824
The judges have
been so talkative,

255
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:48,524
but now they're totally
frozen all of a sudden.

256
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:51,291
Um... What's it?

257
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:53,691
So what's it like?
Is it any good?

258
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,224
How do I even
try to describe
this masterpiece?

259
00:13:57,324 --> 00:14:00,858
Hot and cold, the ingredients
are infused so well...

260
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,258
These seasoned culinary figures
are at a loss for words!

261
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:07,558
Does that mean the dish is
beyond their comprehension
or understanding?

262
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:12,491
[KITA]
This curry sauce has
been made into a foam,
and is slightly warm.

263
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:15,158
Melting away elegantly
on the tongue.

264
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:19,891
Oh... This beautiful tomato
mousse is refreshingly cool and
pairs with it perfectly.

265
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:23,958
I added spices as well as
sodium alginate to harden it.

266
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,191
I made the mousse
using turmeric

267
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:29,391
and the powder of frozen and
pulverized foie gras.

268
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,424
The white in the middle
is a puree of

269
00:14:31,524 --> 00:14:33,924
potato and six kinds of cheese.

270
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:36,391
And of course,
I flash‐froze it as well,

271
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,424
So it melts the moment
it touches the tongue.

272
00:14:38,524 --> 00:14:42,424
If your mouth becomes too cold,
please have some of the spiced
pie crust.

273
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,991
It's been flavored with
coriander and other spices

274
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,924
to give the tongue
a tantalizing break.

275
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,724
Thermal sense:

276
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:53,024
It's a school of thought in
molecular gastronomy

277
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,858
where elements are used
in varying temperatures.

278
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,558
This dish incorporates
that concept.

279
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:01,624
Uh... so then...
what do you say?

280
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:02,791
Does it taste good or what?

281
00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:05,591
Of course! Perfect!
I can't...

282
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:08,624
I don't have the words to
describe its pure deliciousness!

283
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:11,424
I just can't...
I'm at a loss for words.

284
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:14,224
[SCHOOLBOY]
It's so good even the food
critic can't describe it?!

285
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:16,058
It uses spices as its base,

286
00:15:16,158 --> 00:15:19,058
but contends with alternating
textures and temperatures.

287
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,824
This dish redefines the field
of traditional cooking!

288
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:25,124
<i>Yes. She could be called...</i>

289
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,591
<i>The Global Innovator!</i>

290

291
00:15:30,691 --> 00:15:32,591
[URARA]
95 points!

292
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,491
In a surprising upset,

293
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:38,058
Alice Nakiri leaps to the
top, overthrowing Hisako!

294
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,024
Oh, I didn't get 100?

295
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:41,758
That's unexpected.

296
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,858
Still...

297
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,758
Y'see that? I beat you,
Little Miss Helper.

298
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:47,324
Don't call me,
"Little Miss Helper"?!

299
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:50,824
[SCHOOLBOY]
Awesome! All the judges
gave her 19 points!

300
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:52,691
[SCHOOLGIRL]
That's practically perfect!

301
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,624
Impossible!
Gourmands of such renown.

302
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:57,591
Haven't seen scores
like this in long time!

303
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:00,791
[URARA]
Alice Nakiri takes first place!

304
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,624
Followed by Arato
and then Takumi,

305
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:07,158
And tied for fourth place,
we have Hojo and Isami.

306
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,791
Only four contestants
from B Block will be
allowed to move on.

307
00:16:10,891 --> 00:16:12,658
There will be a runoff vote

308
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,224
for the two contestants
now in fourth.

309
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:16,558
(Crowd cheers)

310
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:18,458
But they still put out
some interesting dishes,

311
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,191
only fitting for
the final contenders.

312
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:23,658
Yes... Hard to say one
is better than the other.

313
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,858
It's been a passionately
heated battle this year.

314
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,991
Now, let's move on
to the voting.

315
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,191
[MEGUMI]
Excuse me...

316
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,124
Huh?

317
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,391
Uh...

318
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,924
Please, I haven't...

319
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,291
presented... my curry.

(Surprised and annoyed murmurs)

322
00:16:42,024 --> 00:16:45,591
<i>Grr! And after I'd built them</i>
<i>up to the grand finale!</i>

323
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:49,058
I‐I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

324
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:51,524
All right!

325
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:53,524
Now it's Megumi's turn!

326
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,891
Megumi!

327
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:58,591
Oh my gosh!

328
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:00,124
What're you guys
doing here?

329
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:02,858
We left the fishin' to all
the young'uns just for today.

330
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,991
We wanted to watch you shine
bright and make us all proud!

331
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,891
Oh, that is just too much.

332
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:11,791
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Check out her crowd. Those are
some pretty rough‐lookin' dudes.

333
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:15,991
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Who the heck IS
this girl, anyway?

334
00:17:16,091 --> 00:17:19,624
[URARA]
Okay, Miss Tadokoro, if we could
get on with the tasting.

335
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:21,591
Go get 'em, Megumi!

336
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,258
You go stick 'em in the craw!

337
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:25,558
(Agreeing)

338
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,958
Um, please! I want to help
my family's restaurant!

339
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:30,991
Please help, sir!

340
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,991
Please, help me!
Please, help me, sir!

341
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:47,091
A monkfish DOBUJIRU
curry, sir.

342
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,824
"Dobujiru"... a hotpot with
monkfish as the main ingredient.

343
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:56,958
Indeed. It's a dish passed down
by fishermen in the Ibaraki and
Fukushima prefectures.

344
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:58,658
<i>Monkfish in curry?</i>

345
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:01,024
<i>Just what is this</i>
<i>girl thinking?</i>

346
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:03,624
Oh wow!

347
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,758
So this is pure heaven.

348
00:18:05,858 --> 00:18:08,391
THIS is what monkfish
cooking is about.

349
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:12,558
[KITA]
The main trait of dobujiru
is that it takes monkfish liver

350
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,158
and slowly cooks it
down in a frying pan.

351
00:18:15,258 --> 00:18:19,458
Miso and sake are added to the
liver to create the flavor base.

352
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,591
This thoughtful young lady
added spices to make a
spectacular "liver curry miso."

353
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,358
My body's free!

354
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,191
I could get addicted
to something like this!

355
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,824
To think, these spices
would be such a match
for the richness of liver!

356
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,991
It's like a warm glow within...

357
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:38,024
After all the food we've eaten,
you can feel it even more.

358
00:18:38,124 --> 00:18:41,258
I mean, there's a
personal touch to this dish.

359
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:45,924
Ingredients include the
monkfish's flesh, its skin,
and fins and...

360
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,458
Hm? What's this?

361
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,091
Kogiku pumpkin,
Tachikawa burdock root,

362
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:52,458
and Akasuji daikon!

363
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,058
Um, it is!

364
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:56,691
All those vegetables are
grown in my hometown.

365
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,558
I tried various ways
of bringing out their flavor,

366
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:04,258
but curry is overpowering and
didn't match the sweetness and
bitterness of the vegetables,

367
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,491
so I was very worried
about what to do.

368
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,524
But in a dobujiru using
monkfish liver,

369
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:12,891
not only is the flavor
of the spices drawn out,

370
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,524
but it acts as a kind of
bridge to the naturalness
of the vegetables.

371
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:20,691
I wanted to make something
where you could taste
AND smells where I was born.

372
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,424
That's the kind of curry
I wanted to make!

373
00:19:24,524 --> 00:19:26,924
[MOTHER]
Huh? Megumi
really made this?

374
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:31,524
[HOSTESS]
Yes! If she worked here,
no one could come close to her!

375
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:37,124
[MOTHER]
Apparently, there's a
world famous cooking school
stationed in Tokyo.

376
00:19:37,224 --> 00:19:39,491
You think you
might wanna go
there, sweetie?

377
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:43,691
They say a bunch of
its graduates are
working all over the world.

378
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,158
[MEGUMI]
Yes, but...

379
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,558
Mom, I...

380
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:49,258
In the future, I was
gonna help out around the inn.

381
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:53,524
Well if in the end
you decide you still want
to work here that'll be fine.

382
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:56,124
And actually, that would
make me real happy.

383
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:59,524
But first, I'd like for
you to go out just once

384
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,158
to see what the big,
wide world has to offer.

385
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:03,724
Y'understand?

386
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:09,191
What the heck?!
You tellin' me Megumi's
cooking's only in the 10s?

387
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,958
I told ya, it's the judges five
scores all together that
make a perfect hundred!

388
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:17,858
Way to go! That's our
shining star right there!

389
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:25,124
Take this... It'll
bring you good luck
at school, darlin'.

390
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,158
[FISHERMAN]
Tokyo, huh?

391
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,791
We're gonna miss ya 'round here.

392
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:31,524
But look...
there aint many of us

393
00:20:31,624 --> 00:20:33,691
that're better than you,
ya got that, kiddo?

394
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,991
[OLD CHEF]
Do your best, Megumi!

395
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:40,924
[FISHERMAN]
Megumi might be the
greatest up‐and‐comer
this town's ever had!

396
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,358
[MOTHER on phone]
<i>Megumi, how's school goin'?</i>

397
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,024
Mother, uh... it's uh...

398
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:52,224
It's going great.

399
00:20:52,324 --> 00:20:55,558
My classes are so much fun.

400
00:20:55,658 --> 00:20:57,958
You do know that you're
really talented, right?

401
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,691
Are you going in for some
cooking practice, Megumi?

402
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,524
We'll go with you
if you want.

403
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:04,724
Oh, thank you!

404
00:21:04,824 --> 00:21:08,758
But I thought it would be best
if I study by myself tonight.

405
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:20,658
(Sobbing)

406
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:29,691
Here we are, Megumi,
your day is here.

407
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:33,891
It's time to leave your
tiny, tiny garden...

408
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:37,524
and spread your wings.

409
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,424
[URARA]
Megumi Tadokoro
scores 88 points!

410
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:43,924
4th place!
She leaps into 4th place!

411
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:44,991
(Crowd cheers)

412
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,224
(Chuckling)

413
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,858
Miyoko Hojo is out
of the running!

414
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:49,924
What an upset!

415
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,824
Megumi, you did it!

416
00:21:55,424 --> 00:22:01,724
(Chanting)
Megumi! Megumi! Megumi! Megumi!

417
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:05,791
[MIYOKO]
<i>I thought I had what</i>
<i>it takes to win.</i>

418
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,458
<i>And that princess had nothing.</i>

419
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,824
<i>But it looks like she has</i>
<i>everything she needs.</i>

420
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,791
[NATSUME]
Uh yeah. This is bad.

421
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,958
How could I give points
for a dish like this?

422
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:52,691
Um... okay...

423
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,991
but, um, what about
the student's score?

424
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:56,524
Are you hard of hearing?

425
00:23:56,624 --> 00:23:58,191
I said the dish was bad.

426
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:01,758
WAHH! Oh so,
the total score is...

427
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,391
19 points.

428
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:07,591
[SHUN]
Natsume Sendawara gave
zero points again.

429
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:10,258
She's judged more
than 10 contestants

430
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:12,391
and hasn't given a
single point.

431
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:14,658
Even though everything
looked delicious, huh?

432
00:24:14,758 --> 00:24:17,091
It's crazy... it's like
a graveyard, dude!

433
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:20,424
A‐Block's judges seem to be
pretty tough on these guys!

434
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:23,324
Please, uh, the next contestant!

435
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,558
Ryo Kurokiba,
if you would be so kind!

436
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:27,491
It's your turn.

437
00:24:34,291 --> 00:24:37,591
[ALICE]
Next time, on the twenty‐third
course of Food Wars...

438
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:39,358
Darnit, Ryo, say something!

439
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:40,891
[RYO]
Uhh...

440
00:24:40,991 --> 00:24:43,791
[ALICE]
"The Unfolding Individual
Competition"

441
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:46,358
I'll be the one
to reach the top!

442
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:47,924
Uh, isn't this
a bit much?

443
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:51,791
Nah, not at all. Nothing's
too much for our girl!
