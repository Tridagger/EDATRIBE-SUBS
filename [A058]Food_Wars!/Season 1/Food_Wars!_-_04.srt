"test" of yours.

I've tasted in my life.

oughta be enough.

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,633
give me a few minutes!

96
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:52,333
There should've only been
a scrap or two of ground pork
and beef lying around.

97
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,000
[FUMIO]
How could this be?

98
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
How did he make such
a thick Hamburg steak?

99
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,866
Hmph. I used the rest of your
canned mackerel to make...

100
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:01,100
a "Mackerel burger"!

101
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,533
Canned mackerel?!

102
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,666
[SOMA]
I added onions and breadcrumbs
to the egg,

103
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:07,433
then mixed it with
the mackerel,

104
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,200
added pepper, and lightly
salted it.

105
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,766
I fried that up, creating a
flaky mackerel‐burger steak.

106
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,700
Then, I added ponzu

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,266
to the leftover mackerel liquid

108
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,766
and thickened it up
with some potato starch

109
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,633
to make a simple,
refreshing sauce.

110
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,166
Given the timeframe;

111
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,566
I call it: Yukihira Brand
"Use What You've Got"...

112
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,833
Holy Mackerel Burger!

113
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,700
What's this?

114
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,133
Impossible.

115
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:38,300
A "Hamburg steak" made from
canned mackerel...

116
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,233
This should be horrendous
and inedible.

117
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,766
Haahmmm...

118
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,533

<i>Mmmm...</i>

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,066
<i>It's so thick that if</i>
<i>he'd told me he used just</i>
<i>meat, I'd believe it.</i>

00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>And it's fried up so</i>
<i>flaky and soft!</i>

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,566
<i>Well, what's with</i>
<i>this egg soup?</i>

125
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,466
Ah! Where is all this
flavor coming from?!

126
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,433
<i>It's the quality of the</i>
<i>fish stock that makes</i>
<i>a soup's flavor.</i>

127
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:18,566
<i>This rich taste is</i>

129
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,366
Hey boy, how on earth
did you make this?

130
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:24,800
We have no seaweed
or fish flakes

131
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,000
nothing that could have been
used to create a fish stock!

Well, about that...

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,900

something on hand.

Squid?!

136
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,900
You mean you used that
thing to make your stock?!

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,266
[SOMA]
Dried squid is pure umami.

138
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:45,200
Soak it for a while in
some boiling water,
add some salt,

139
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,966
and you'll get a richly
flavored soup stock.

140
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,433
The perfect start
for many dishes.

00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,533
<i>have left me utterly exhausted.</i>

175
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,300
(Cackle)
[MEGUMI]
<i>Soma, that jerk‐wad!</i>

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,566
<i>He treats me like some kind</i>
<i>of experimental lab rat.</i>

177
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,666
Ahh...

178
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,900
That right, Mr. Ducky?

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,066
Soma's a real pain
in the butt, huh?

180
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,033
[FUMIO]
Ahem! Very well!

181
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,500
Uuuh!
You may live in the dorm!

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,333
Huh?!

183
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:00,466
Hm!

184
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,566
You're welcome!

185
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,366
Your room is No. 303.

186
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:05,966
Here.

187
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:08,033
Oh, yes!

188
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,266
<i>Doing so much with such</i>
<i>limited ingredients...</i>

189
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:14,466
<i>Looks like we have an</i>
<i>interesting new resident.</i>

190
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,866
<i>Soma Yukihira, hm?</i>

191
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:19,033
[MEGUMI]
Ahh... Ever since I got here,

192
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:23,033
this is the only place where
I've been able to relax.

193
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,333
Ms. Fumio CAN be
a bit terrifying,

194
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,600
but at least there aren't
any strict teachers or Soma.

195
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,366
[SOMA]
Guess I'll start things
off with a hot bath!

196
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,533
Hm?

197
00:11:31,633 --> 00:11:32,800
(Gasp)

198
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,266
Hm.

199
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:35,966
Uh!

200
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:39,000
(Fearful whimper)

201
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,400
(Terrified scream)

202
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,033
Oh. I see he's already
making some friends.

203
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,900
I'll have to tell him
the bath schedule.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,366
[FUMIO]
Oh... What's
going on there?

205
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:01,233
(Owl hooting)

206
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,733
Man, that bath felt good.

207
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,600
(Exhale)

208
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,933
<i>Heh. This is my first time</i>
<i>away from the only home</i>
<i>I've ever known for 15 years.</i>

209
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:19,066
[SOMA]
'Kay! Here's your
liver and onions!

210
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,033
Can I get a meat‐and‐tofu
plate, please?

211
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,466
Say, uh... And I'd like
to have the daily special.

212
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,000
Right, you got it!

213
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,766
One meat‐and‐tofu! One daily!

214
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,066
It's so quiet...

215
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:36,066
Hello! Young transfer student!

216
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:37,433
Guh! Huh?!

217
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,800
Who are you and what are
you doing up there?!

218
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,266
Come on, there's
a welcome party.

219
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,700
[ZENJI]
I already told you...

220
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,766
I am extremely busy trying to
study for my written exam!

221
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,633
If you want to have a party,
do it in someone else's room!

222
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,033
Why do you guys always
insist on coming in here?

223
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,600
What choice do we have?

224
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,900
You have the only room
that can fit us all.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,133
Hey, do not
sit on my bed!

226
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:02,300
And not to mention
how sparkly clean it is!

227
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,233
Because I just finished
straightening it up!

228
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,366
Oh yeah, there was crap
all over the place, huh?

229
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:09,100
[ZENJI]
Because you two
destroyed the place!

230
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,533
Dude, you need to get some
more chairs up in here.

231
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:12,833
No, I don't!

232
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,100
Hmph.

233
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,166
[AOKI]
Whoops!

234
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:17,600
[ZENJI]
Ah! My books again!

235
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
[AOKI]
Sorry bro.

236
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,700
(Shy whimpers)

237
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,266
Listen here, sweetheart.

238
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:25,333
A true lady never exposes her
goodies 'til she gets married.

239
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:27,433
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

240
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:30,566
<i>But nobody is going to</i>
<i>make me his bride now!</i>

241
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,000
It's pretty crazy, Megumi...

242
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,533
I can't believe we
ended up in the same dorm.

243
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,033
Isn't it though.

244
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:38,300
Hmm! You mean to tell me
that you actually passed

245
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,866
the entrance exam on
your very first try.

246
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:42,233
Sort of.

247
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm just glad that
it worked out.

248
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,566
That's incredible...

249
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,466
Not very many people
have cleared the test

250
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:48,766
in just one shot.

251
00:13:48,866 --> 00:13:50,933
[SOMA]
Huh? How'd it
go with you?

252
00:13:51,033 --> 00:13:55,066
Um... So‐so,
I guess you might say.

253
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:57,466
Ah?
<i>I‐I can't say it.</i>

254
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:00,266
<i>I can't say it took me</i>
<i>three months to get in!</i>

255
00:14:00,366 --> 00:14:02,133
Hey. You want
some of this?

256
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,933
Oh? Ah, thank you.

257
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,300
Sure.

258
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,700
(Sniff)
Huh?

259
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,133
[SOMA]
It's so cloudy...

260
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,266
<i>And the bottle has</i>
<i>a handwritten label.</i>

261
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:18,566
Yeah it's some "special"
juice I made from rice.

262
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:19,466
Drink up.

263
00:14:19,566 --> 00:14:20,600
Uh‐huh...

264
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,233
(Festivities continue)

265
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:25,100
[SOMA]
So, it's okay to make all this
racket this late at night?

266
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,166
[RYOKO]
It's fine. The dorm is
in the middle of a forest.

267
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:29,933
[SOMA]
Yeah, but still...

268
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,133
I mean, won't the dorm
mother get mad and‐

269
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,966
Guh!
[FUMIO, LOUDSPEAKER]
<i>Hey! You kids!</i>

270
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:38,133
<i>There's stewed amberjack</i>
<i>and daikon down here.</i>
<i>Come and get it!</i>

271
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,666
Whoo! All
right, dude!

272
00:14:39,766 --> 00:14:40,833
Love you, Gramma!

273
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,466
(Both laugh)
They're going
down?!

274
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,733
I'm sure they'll be back
before Ms. Fumio

275
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,066
starts yammering
on about The Ten.

276
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,033
<i>"The Ten"?</i>

277
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,400
Get away from her!

278
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,633
Do you know who
you just touched?
Not really.

279
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:56,700
This is none other than
the top student in the
Middle‐School Division

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,633
and the youngest member
in history ever seated at the
table for the Council of Ten...

281
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,366
this is Erina Nakiri!

282
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,733
[SOMA]
<i>The Ten...</i>

283
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,066
What is "The Council
of Ten" exactly?

284
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,033
Huh? Are you
asking for real?

285
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:18,233
What? You seriously came
here not knowing anything
about the Tohtsuki Academy?

286
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,733
Zenji, will you
please fill him in?

287
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,700
Why's it always
gotta be ME?

288
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,233
Oh stop your
complaining.

289
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,466
Can you just help
the new guy out?

290
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:28,233
All right, fine.

291
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,866
The Tohtsuki Council of Ten...

292
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:36,400
It's a committee made up
of the ten highest‐ranked
students on campus.

293
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,433
At Tohtsuki, students settle
most of their issues through
self‐governance,

294
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:44,700
and all items are decided by a
mutual consensus of the Ten.

295
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,733
It is the highest
decision‐making body on campus.

296
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:51,733
In terms of school
organization, they're
right below the director.

297
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:57,066
Which means, even the
teachers have to follow
the decisions made by The Ten.

298
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,400
It is said that decades ago

299
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,766
the rooms at Kyokusei
were always full,

300
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:05,033
and that most members of
The Ten often came from here.

301
00:16:05,133 --> 00:16:09,400
There was even a time when
Kyokusei residents held every
single one of the council seats.

302
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,333
Hm?

303
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,266
And Ms. Fumio can
really get going

304
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:13,766
on and on about it, too.

305
00:16:13,866 --> 00:16:15,233
Huh?

306
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:18,566
<i>And I take it Erina Nakiri</i>
<i>is one of The Ten, huh?</i>

307
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:19,866
(Door opens)
Uh!

308
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,133
[BOTH]
Back with
deliciousness, dudes!

309
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,966
[ISSHIKI]
Hello, Young
Soma Yukihira.

310
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,566
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

311
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,700
We're glad you're with us.

312
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,033
I am Satoshi Isshiki,
a 2nd‐year.

313
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,566
Please call me
"Isshiki"

314
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,033
Will do.

315
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,200
Well. Isn't this just lovely.

316
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,066
I am simply delighted we
have acquired a new student.

317
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,200
We must share the
bloom of our youth!

318
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,800
Nothing on Earth could
make me happier!

319
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,133
Now listen to me:

320
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,600
We are adolescents
living under
the same roof,

321
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
sharing our joys
and sorrows!

322
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,733
This student life is
a blossoming spring!

323
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,733
I entered this dormitory
enamored with that concept.

324
00:16:56,833 --> 00:17:01,733
Let us embrace one another
and rejoice in our resplendent
dorm‐life existence!

325
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,733
That's real nice and all,

326
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:07,133
but can you please stop
comin' to get us by creeping
around in the attic?

327
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:09,133
Doesn't sit right
with you?

328
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,433
Hmm... I suppose I could
use this contraption.

329
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,933
[ISSHIKI]
When I do, Megumi Tadokoro
is always quick to respond.

330
00:17:16,033 --> 00:17:18,033
Uh, well, do I have to...?

331
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:22,000
[MEGUMI](Scared whimpers)
[ISSHIKI](Creepy whisper)
<i>Megumi. Are you asleep?</i>

332
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,333
<i>I'm having a little</i>
<i>fun over here.</i>

333
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:26,000
(Continued whimpering)
<i>But I'm all alone...</i>

334
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,500
<i>And I have so much</i>
<i>WONDERFUL food to share.</i>

335
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,333
<i>Scamper on over if</i>
<i>you're still awake. M'kay?</i>

336
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,866
<i>I promise I'll... make</i>
<i>it worth your while.</i>

337
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,966
If I don't, then
you'll just keep
calling me, won't you?

338
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,400
He'll eventually give up
if you just ignore him, okay?

339
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,200
You need to stand
your ground, girl.

340
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,933
But it does totally suck
