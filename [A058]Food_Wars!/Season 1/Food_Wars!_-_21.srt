<i>Really? He's sleeping?</i>

00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,944
<i>How can he be asleep</i>

00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,578
<i>There it is!</i>

5
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,078
<i>Done!</i>

00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,111
Hey, look!
Check out his pot!

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,711
That's rice!
He's boiled vegetables and
spices in with the rice!

10
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:36,444
[AKIRA]
That pot of yours...

11
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:39,778
I see you've added a paste of
apples, bananas, and carrots.

12
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:44,678
Interesting. It will give the
rice a thickness, making it
into a kind of risotto.

13
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,244
Well done, Akira!

14
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,211
You can smell all that
just standing there?

15
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,944
You've got yourself
a great sniffer.

16
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:52,578
<i>No. There's another</i>
<i>hidden element.</i>

17
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,211
<i>The aromatic spices that he's</i>
<i>using aren't all that unique...</i>

18
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:58,844
<i>so what's making</i>
<i>this aroma so complex?</i>

19
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:01,878
The truth is,
I was experimenting
till early morning.

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,911
I was trying to really
concentrate on the aroma

21
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:06,244
and kinda fell asleep
in the middle of it all.

22
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:07,678
Nothing fazes you,
does it?

23
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,244
You just keep
on watching...

24
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:13,411
for when my dish really
starts to come together.

00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,578
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Man, look at that redneck.
She's barely even
trying to cook down there.

26
00:03:02,678 --> 00:03:04,644
I swear, she pisses me off!

What was that?

29
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,511
What'd you dill weeds just
spew outta your mouths?!

30
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,144
Got something to say,
say it to me!

31
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,344
AAHHHH!

32
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:16,744
[FUMIO]
That's enough!

33
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,511
Just leave the punks be.

34
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,311
But, Miss Fumio,
they deserve it!

35
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,078
They're talking so friggin' loud
Megumi's gonna hear!

36
00:03:23,178 --> 00:03:25,678
Just cheer those two
on as much as you can, boys.

37
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:27,911
Alright, then.
We understand.

38
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:31,044
Megumi! Yuki! Good luck!

39
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,044
Yeah!

40
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,478
[AOKI and SATO]
Cook that food's butt!

41
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:34,478
This should just
about take care of

42
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:35,878
all the prep work.

43
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,878
Now I have to get to
work on the protein.

44
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,178
Ah!

45
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:41,978
Do you know what is the
greatest burden in the kitchen?

46
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:43,478
A fool not paying attention...

47
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,944
who doesn't know
their surroundings
and gets in the way!

48
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:50,111
Oh, okay! I'm very sorry!
I'll be more careful.

49
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:51,711
Oooohh...

50
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:53,811
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Miyoko finally added her spice!

51
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,711
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Now that it's got
a strong aroma,

52
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:58,911
she's adding it to the
egg and stir‐fried rice!

53
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:02,911
Look at that!
He's awesome, too!

54
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,611
[SCHOOLBOY 4]
He cut that pasta so fast!

55
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:10,478
[SCHOOLBOY 5]
Such technique! To think,
he could take a mezzaluna,

56
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:13,644
which is mainly used for dicing,
and slice noodles so perfectly!

57
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:17,311
Check out his brother
behind him. What kind
of dough is that?!

58
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,878
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Oh, I can't take my eyes
off either of them!

59
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,678
Looks like Megumi's
holdin' her own, bro!

60

Totally, dude. Let's see some
of her awesome technique!

Ah! Uhh...

62
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,711

<i>After the rumors I heard</i>

67
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:44,444

69
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,111
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Look at that!

70
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:53,411
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
She's using monkfish?!

71
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:55,511
How is she gonna
prepare THAT?!

72
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,011
(Chuckle)

73
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:59,844
[ORIE]
What does that girl
think she's doing?

74
00:04:59,944 --> 00:05:01,478
Slicing the meat
while it hangs.

75
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,144
Yes, I already know that.

76
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,878
The skin of the
monkfish is covered with
a gelatinous substance,

77
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:08,844
so it's hard to prepare on
a cutting board.

78
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:12,044
She's using the traditional
method to break it down.

79
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,678
But still...

80
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:14,911
Because it's hangin'
in mid‐air

81
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,478
without a stable surface,

82
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,911
it takes a special skill to be
able to cut it properly.

83
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:24,411
[SATO]
For her to choose such a tough
fish to prepare at a major
event like this is pretty bold!

84
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:26,544

00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:30,144

from back home.

It's how I was taught
to get my mind right.

93
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:59,144
The only drawback is you
can't do it by yourself.

I'm so sorry.

is a specialty,

up for the entertainment
of our customers, but...

provide the strength
it takes.

00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:52,342
[FUMIO]
Osaji Kita...

172
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,142
Organizer of the Kita
Gastronomy Club,

173
00:09:55,242 --> 00:09:59,808
which only the most elite of
the cultural and business worlds
are allowed to become members.

174
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:05,042
The power of money brings
all the world's delicacies
to that man's table.

175
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:06,875
[FUMIO]
Over there is Shingo Ando.

176
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,408
He's an author and essayist
that holds sway over all
culinary culture.

177
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:15,308
Lord knows how many restaurants
he's shut down with a
stroke of his pen.

178
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:18,142
This dish uses
achari murgh spices,

179
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,675
a dish representative of
northern India, as a base.

180
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:26,642
[KITA]
The splendid fragrance of the
chat masala is used to increase
the acidity profile.

181
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:30,242
[KITA]
What's more, the meat
was prepared in a
chicken tikka style

182
00:10:30,342 --> 00:10:32,642
rather than as a
chicken marsala.

183
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:36,108
Having been deboned,
it's tender enough to
eat with a spoon.

184
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,908
It's a well
thought‐out dish,

185
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,975
one that's considerate
of the diner.

186
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:43,608
[KITA]
Now THAT is a student
of Tohtsuki, my friends!

187
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,442
Why, thank you very much.

188
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,508
And now for the score, please!

189
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,042
Let's see it!

190
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:58,142
[SCHOOLBOY]
The maximum score per judge
is 20 points, not 10, right?

191
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,242
[SCHOOLGIRL]
But they praised him so much!

192
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:02,808
My dish is only good
for a measly 33 points?!

193
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:03,975
What's that supposed to be?!

194
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,108
Watch yourself!

195
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,675
Who the hell
do you think we are?!

196
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:11,275
Every day we critique
chefs with a lot more
tricks up their sleeves

197
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,308
than you could
possible imagine!

198
00:11:13,408 --> 00:11:17,675
This was prepared well,
but it's still on the
level of a mere student.

199
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:23,675
And listen here.
You should be ecstatic if you
were to reach even 50 points.

200
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:28,208
<i>I see. The Sendawara</i>
<i>sisters aren't the only</i>
<i>sharks in the tank.</i>

201
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:33,375
[TAKUMI]
<i>All five of them have spent</i>
<i>years indulging in the finest</i>
<i>of cuisines.</i>

202
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:37,642
<i>They have a completely</i>
<i>different standard when</i>
<i>it comes to taste.</i>

203
00:11:37,742 --> 00:11:38,875
[URARA]
28 points!

206
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:45,208
<i>No way... All those dishes</i>

207
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:48,842
<i>Are you kidding me? No one's</i>
<i>even reached 40 points yet.</i>

208
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,775
The string of harsh reviews
continues!

209
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:54,375
Now then, our next dish is...

210
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:55,742
UUUGGHH!

211
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,642
That reeks!

212
00:11:57,742 --> 00:12:00,442
[ORIE]
What is that stench?!

213
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,008
Ingest...

214
00:12:02,108 --> 00:12:04,875
It's the Nao
Sadatsuka's special...

215
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,575
(Terrified screams)
pitch‐black Laksa curry!

216
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:10,175
(Disgusted outcries)

217
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,908
It smells like
sewer water!

218
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,742
[URARA]
It's Hell on Earth!

219
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,908
Death has assailed us
here at this venue!

220
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:21,008
I can't imagine something
like THIS at an event meant to
celebrate the finest of cuisine!

221
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,942
[URARA]
It's killin' me!

222
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,908
Yeah. I thought
something like this
might happen.

223
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:28,142
I'm glad I came prepared
with some protection.

224
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:34,708
Laksa. A dish from Southeast
Asia that uses a noodle with a
unique, "slippery" mouthfeel.

225
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,908
The darkness of the broth
is from squid ink.

226
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:40,442
[KITA]
This commanding stench
that turns the nose...

227
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,142
Please no!

228
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,508
It's kusaya.

229
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,108
I knew it!

230
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,708
Why in the hell would you use
something like that in a CURRY,

231
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,175
you twisted heathen?!

232
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:50,075
Kusaya...

233
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,208
A dish famous on
the Izu Islands.

234
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:56,375
The same saltwater used to
steep fish for years or
even decades,

235
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,975
a fermenting liquid known
as "kusaya broth,"

236
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,942
is used as a brine for
blueback fish such as sardines

237
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,308
that are then left
to dry in the sun.

238
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,808
It really stinks!

239
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:08,408
On top of that,
it's my own special blend.

240
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:11,442
I chose to use flying fish
and mahi‐mahi.

241
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,108
It uses a kusaya broth
I brewed oh‐so carefully.

242
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,175
You get a zero,
you little devil child!

243
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:20,508
I've eaten some
strange foodstuff in
my time, but this...

244
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,875
Uh, Miss Orie,
you're trying it?!

245
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:25,042
Merely to fulfill my
responsibility

246
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:27,408
as a sponsor of this
competition.

247
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:34,142
<i>The harsh acidity mixed with</i>
<i>that foul, fishy odor...</i>

248
00:13:34,242 --> 00:13:38,342
<i>It smells like an unwashed</i>
<i>toilet!</i>

249
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:54,842
I‐it's delicious?

250
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,608
[ORIE]
But it stinks!
It really stinks!

251
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,908
But it's so delicious!

252
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:01,608
Even though it stinks!

253
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,575
Wh‐wh‐what's going on?

254
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,542
She says that it stinks,
but she keeps going back
in for more!

255
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:11,575
<i>The flavor reminds me of kapi,</i>
<i>a fermented shrimp paste.</i>

256
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:15,242
<i>By using ingredients far</i>
<i>stronger than those in kapi,</i>

257
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:18,675
<i>she creates a depth of flavor</i>
<i>comparable to laksa,</i>

258
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,675
<i>which uses fish stock</i>
<i>as its base.</i>

259
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:24,508
<i>It all makes horrible,</i>
<i>wonderful sense!</i>

260
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,875
<i>The seafood flavor spreads</i>
<i>across the tongue!</i>

261
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:28,508
<i>It's delicious!</i>

262
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:29,942
<i>The more you chew it,</i>

263
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,275
<i>the more this "stink"</i>
<i>grows into a good thing!</i>

264
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:35,142
<i>She's used spices</i>
<i>like lemongrass,</i>
<i>as well as coconut milk,</i>

265
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:37,875
<i>to give the dish some</i>
<i>added flavor!</i>

266
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,908
<i>Having kusaya as the</i>
<i>star ingredient</i>

267
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,475
<i>actually makes the curry</i>
<i>that much more enchanting!</i>

268
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:45,175
<i>Nao Sadatsuka</i>
<i>is an expert in</i>
<i>simmered dishes.</i>

269
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,442
<i>She's a wealth of</i>
<i>knowledge regarding</i>
<i>dried fish</i>

270
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,275
<i>as well as other</i>
<i>dried goods that are</i>
<i>hard to work with.</i>

271
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,708
(Cackle)

272
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,142
[ISSHIKI]
<i>Her cooking room gives off</i>
<i>a sinister air,</i>

273
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,708
<i>one that would send children</i>
<i>crying to their mothers.</i>

274
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:01,742
<i>The odor emitting from it</i>
<i>has been known to cause</i>
<i>quite a commotion.</i>

275
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:04,042
<i>And thus, the reason</i>

00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:07,675
<i>"The Boiling Witch"!</i>

277
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,942
True aesthetics are rare
in most food. One must
dig deeper to find them.

278
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:17,442
The essence of fine cuisine
is hidden in the grotesque.

279
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,275
<i>Such creativity!</i>

280
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,642
<i>This is the first page</i>
<i>in a new book on curry!</i>

Um, there we have it!
84 points!

That's the first time
someone's cleared fifty!

287
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,142

I can't believe it
was her who did it!

288

[SCHOOLBOY 3]
She's in first place for now!

289
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:52,242
Aah... I would like
Miss Erina to partake in
my delectable curry.

290
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:56,775
Well, while we're
airing out the venue,
let's go ahead and continue.

291
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:59,475
Will the next student
please come forward?

292
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:02,675
I've waited for this...

293
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:05,675
to utterly defeat
and humiliate you

294
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:10,942
in front of everyone,
Hisako Arato.

295
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:15,602
[OFFICIAL]
Alright.

296
00:16:15,702 --> 00:16:18,602
This battle is being recognized
as an official Food War!

297
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:21,002
Do either of you have any
objections to the rules?

298
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:23,102
So we're clear, Hisako.

299
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,702
If I win this battle,

300
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:28,035
you will hand over your prized
role as Miss Erina's assistant.

301
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:29,935
Of course, Nao.

302
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,735
And if I win,
from now on...

303
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:37,302
you won't get within 50 meters
of my treasured Miss Erina!

304
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:40,069
Being at her side
to bask in her glow...

305
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:44,002
while being subjected
to her verbal cruelties
is my dream!

306
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:49,302
Oh all the foul obscenities
that would pour forth from
her godlike tongue...

307
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,302
(Sinister laugh)

308
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,969
But we have already
battled for that privilege.

309
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,835
I have beaten you.
And quite decisively.

310
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:57,902
Yes...

311
00:16:58,002 --> 00:16:59,535
But since that time...

312
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,935
I've had to view her divinity
through binoculars...

313
00:17:03,035 --> 00:17:07,469
and have resorted to
sending my beautiful angel
just 30 sad letters a day.

314
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,502
<i>I should have made that</i>
<i>off‐limits as well.</i>

315
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:14,735
But if I publicly annihilate you
at this Fall Selection,

316
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:18,235
Miss Erina may well have a
change of heart.

317
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,235
She will let me
walk by her side
forever more.

318
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,635
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Look! Miss Erina's
assistant is next!

319
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,935

I bet she'll put out
an awesome dish!

320
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:28,402
[HISAKO]
Please enjoy.

321
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:32,102
[ORIE]
The roux looks watery
and lacking thickness.

322
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:34,535
This looks more akin
to a soup curry.

323
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:36,602
This meat is mutton,
is it not?

324
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:41,602
[KITA]
Though from the same
animal, it has a
stronger smell than lamb,

325
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,569
but the spices should
mask the odor.

326
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:47,135
[ORIE]
Odor!

327
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:52,069

The effects of my cooking
still linger on, don't they?

328
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,402
<i>That, my dear, is my curse!</i>

329
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:56,469
<i>My curse upon you, Hisako!</i>

330
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:59,502
Well, I guess we should
give this dish a try.

331
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,535
<i>This is...</i>

00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,169
OH!

333
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:09,069
Is everything okay over
there, Mister Ando?

334
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,535
Uh...

335
00:18:10,635 --> 00:18:11,769
What?

336
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:15,602
Wh‐what?!

337
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:16,702
This from Ando,

338
00:18:16,802 --> 00:18:18,569
the man who actually
mutters unintelligibly,

339
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:20,835
actin' like some
uprooted, withered tree.

340
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:22,169
I don't know what's going on,

341
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,635
but now you're starting
to sound like someone

342
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,602
in a kung fu movie!

343
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,169
[ANDO]
This unique aroma... It's...

344
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,935
Fuuwaaa...

345
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:33,635
Angelica! Rehmannia!
Lovage! And peony!

346
00:18:33,735 --> 00:18:35,635
This dish uses the four
main ingredients

347
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,035
of Chinese herbal medicine
as its main base!

348
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:41,269
It's the Four Pillars of
Herbalism!

349
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:43,435
When devoured all at once,

350
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,202
the Four Pillars
do great things.

351
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:49,235
They can instantly bring
people back from the grips
of death's hands!

352
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:50,635
[KITA]
Of course!

353
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,502
She must have infused them
along with the spices!

354
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:56,469
Yes. That's her
specialty after all.

355
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:01,269
Hisako Arato: the Expert
of Medicinal Cooking!

356
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,769
[ALICE]
It's a discipline
based in Eastern medicine.

357
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,535
The combination of techniques
creating nourishing food

358
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,835
infused with natural drugs and
herbs used in Chinese remedies.

359
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,269
A fusion of food, medicine,
and pharmacology...

360
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,535
My original spice
mixture contains

361
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:20,102
ginger, star anise, and a
dash of fennel thrown in.

362
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:23,102
I added that to four more
medicinal ingredients.

363
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:27,935
I boiled those spices about
an hour earlier to draw
out their medicinal properties.

364
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:32,002
And then, I added the
vegetables and mutton and
let them simmer until moist

365
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,569
and the flavors seeped in.

366
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,635
Shaoxing rice wine and coriander
elevated the aroma profile.

367
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,069
Ahh...

368
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:40,769
Come to think of it,

369
00:19:40,869 --> 00:19:42,169
curry and medicinal foods

370
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:44,169
have a lot in common with
each other, don't they?

371
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:46,769
[KITA]
Kyo‐o is turmeric.

372
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:49,235
Dai‐i‐kyo is star anise.

373
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:51,135
Sho‐i‐kyo is fennel.

374
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:55,402
All these spices are
absolutely essential in
making a great curry!

375
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:57,569
So that was her goal here.

376
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,902
A blending of curry
and medicinal cooking!

377
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:02,102
My brand of medicinal cooking:

378
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,902
brings forth a
"Four‐Pillar Mutton Curry"!

379
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:07,102
Ah! I can feel it! It's true!

380
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:10,935
The energy from this medicinal
meal is racing through my body!

381
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,635
AHHH!

382
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,835
<i>It's superb!</i>

383
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:20,402
<i>The flavor of the mutton is</i>
<i>heightened by the spices,</i>

384
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,935
<i>and the vegetables have</i>
<i>absorbed the roux,</i>

385
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,669
<i>becoming sweet and</i>
<i>velvety smooth!</i>

386
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,835
Thanks to the Four Pillars,

387
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:31,669
the body feels warmed the
second you take a bite!

388
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:35,935
Definitely. Medicinal food
is said to aid the kidneys
and lend strength...

389
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,435
as well as rid the
body of toxins.

390
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,502
[KITA]
It's the perfect balance of
flavor and aroma!

391
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,602
This is incredibly well done!

392
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,135
It not somethin' you'd expect
a student to prepare!

393
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:48,902
This is divine singularity.

394
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:52,602
Eating this curry makes
the last dish look like
a simple indulgence.

395
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:53,835
AHHH!

396
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:55,635
I‐it can't be...

397
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:59,902
I thought my dark curry
and my wickedness had made
slaves of the judges!

398
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:02,035
Here you go, Ms. Nao.

399
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,269
Once you eat some,
you will soon understand

400
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:08,402
the stark difference in
level between you and me!

401
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,869
<i>Hesitation... Chaos...</i>

402
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:19,635
<i>THAT is the essence</i>
<i>of my cooking, and yet...</i>

403
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:22,335
<i>It's all being washed away.</i>

404
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:24,835
<i>I'm being cleansed!</i>

405
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:28,935
<i>Stop it!</i>

406
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,769
My family has had a long
relationship with Chinese
medicine.

407
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,835
I've incorporated all
that into my cooking,

408
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,402
so that I could help Miss Erina,

409
00:21:51,502 --> 00:21:54,769
who has been forced into
hardship from such a young age.

410
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,935
That is the source of my
medicinal cooking.

411
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,002
In the palaces of
ancient China,

412
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:03,269
emperors were assigned a
medical diet called
"gastric health,"

413
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,702
which was the introduction
of medicinal food.

414
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:08,835
To me, Miss Erina is the only
empress I will serve.

415
00:22:08,935 --> 00:22:13,735
Nao Sadatsuka, your
cooking shows you only
think of yourself to impress.

416
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:17,535
You have no right to
serve the divine Miss Erina!

417
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,135
Stay far away.

418
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:20,302
And get up.

419
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:23,135
So then, Hisako Arato's
score is...

420
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,002
92 points!

421
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:26,769
(Cheering)

422
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:28,469
This is so insane!

423
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,869
That's why Miss Erina has
chosen her to be her aide!

424
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:32,302
That's over 90 points!

425
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:35,302
[SCHOOLBOY 4] She easily
beat Sadatsuka's score!

426
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:39,935
(Laughing)

427
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:43,335
My Big Sister, Miss Hisako!

428
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,235
[URARA]
Now this is a match to watch!

429
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:18,369
Big Brother...

430
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:20,169
I really want
to beat you.

431
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,769
You think you can handle
something like that?

432
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:23,969
Hmph!

433
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:27,069
I'll give you a shot,
Little Brother.

434
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,569
[URARA]
The Aldini Brothers!

435
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:37,302
[AKIRA]
Next time, on the twenty‐second
course of Food Wars...

436
00:24:37,402 --> 00:24:40,169
It will be me who
rises to the top.

437
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,169
"That Which Transcends
the Norm"

438
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,802
Smells good, doesn't it?

439
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:49,069
[HISAKO]
Princess Erina,
I shall protect you!

440
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,435
My sweet Hisako.
