1
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:05,033
(Man whimpering)
[IKUMI]
So...

2
00:00:05,133 --> 00:00:07,666
are you gonna do
it with me?

3
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:09,800
I know you want to.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,766
Come on.
(Gulp)

5
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,233
Just do it with me...

6
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:16,700
[IKUMI]
A Food War.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,566
Dah!

8
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:19,533
Mmm...

9
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,400
(Opening Song)

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,300
(Snoring)

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
[ISSHIKI]
<i>Good morning, Young Soma.</i>

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
<i>I could use</i>
<i>a bit of help.</i>

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,133
<i>Could you get dressed</i>
<i>and come on over?</i>

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,466
Dude.

15
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,566
I stayed up way
too late last night.

16
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,733
I'm super tired.

17
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,266
Ask someone else
to help out.

18
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,166
Oh come on, don't say that!

19
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,400
You have got to
stop doing that!

20
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,766
(Yuki laughs)

21
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,633
I see he woke you up, too.

22
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:15,933
[SOMA]
Yes, he did.

23
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:17,533
So, what are we supposed
to help him with?

24
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:20,366
We're collecting vegetables
from our field.

25
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:21,366
That's awesome.

26
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,333
We even grow our
own stuff here?

27
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:24,866
(Laughs)

28
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:28,200
Well, delicious food starts
with only the best ingredients.

29
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,566
That's our dorm's motto.

30
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,700
[SOMA]
Woah.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
[YUKI]
That's how Shun gets wood for
making his smoked dishes.

32
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,966
[YUKI]
Ryoko's specialty is making
meals with malted rice,

33
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:46,966
so she has her own
workshop just for that.

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,400
(Caw)

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,466
As for me,

36
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,300
I want to breed a
"Kyokusei Chicken"

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,466
equal to the French
Poulet de Bresse.

38
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,866
And I let them run
free range of course.

39
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,133
That's cool.

40
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,966
[YUKI]
And then...

41
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,400
Isshiki's main area
of operation...

42
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,466
...is here!

43
00:03:07,566 --> 00:03:10,200
This plot grows dozens of
different vegetables.

44
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,533
[SOMA]
Woahoho...

45
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,233
...oooooh...

46
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,133
Hm?!

47
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:17,766
Hup!

48
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:18,733
Good morning!

49
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,333
Hello Soma. Hello Yuki.

50
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,700
[BOTH] Guuh...
[ISSHIKI]
A bit of hard work
in the morning

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,666
helps soothe the spirits.

52
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:27,166
Let us all sweat together.

53
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,700
What'd he just say?!

54
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,133
Knowing different strains of
ingredients and how they grow

55
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,066
is part of learning
how to cook.

56
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,366
This is known as Kyokusei Field.

57
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,733
But truthfully, it might as
well be called "Isshiki Field".

58
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,466
So...
[MEGUMI]
Ah, Soma!

59
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:42,466
Huh?

60
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,133
[SOMA]
Oh! Megumi came out too.

61
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,966
Look! These are the vegetables
Isshiki grew in the garden.

62
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:49,733
Don't they look amazing?

63
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:50,866
You know what Megumi...

64
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:52,433
That outfit
oddly suits you.

65
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,300
Yep. Megumi is Kyokusei's
breath of fresh air.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,466
Hm?

67
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,633
Here, take a bite of this.

68
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:03,500
[SOMA]
Oh, thanks.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,800
WOW!

70
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,366
It's so plump and sweet!

71
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:15,000
I'd love to stock up on
these for our restaurant!

72
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,633
This is a quality
product here.

73
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,300
Yes, well I may have spent
too much time on them.

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,933
Because, unfortunately,
I haven't really been
going to class.

75
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,400
<i>I think he's got his</i>
<i>priorities messed up...</i>

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
Morning, everyone!

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,133
[YUKI] It's perfect!
[MEGUMI] (Laugh) Wow!

78
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,733
[RYOKO]
Isn't it though?

79
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,500
[SOMA]
Whoa! This is incredible!

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,033
[MEGUMI]
Soma, you haven't
stopped eating.

81
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,100
[SOMA]
Yeah, so what?

82
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,333
Hey, guys! It's time
for breakfast!

83
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:52,333
[YUKI] Work sure
gets you hungry.
[SOMA] My back hurts!

84
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,633
Oh. You made all this
for us, Megumi?

85
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:58,400
Yep. I'm sure
everybody's hungry.
Help yourselves.

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,466
[RYOKO] Wow!
[ISSHIKI]
Looks delectable.

87
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,566
I see it's your special
three‐variety onigiri.

88
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,866
This is FANTASTIC!

89
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:06,800
Onigiri after working
in the garden!

90
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,066
It's time to
stuff my face!

91
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Wow! It's delicious!

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,533
You used a salt
and green onion sauce.

93
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,933
The sauce was added to the
flash‐boiled chicken tenders

94
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:20,733
and it coats the onigiri's
exterior, too!

95
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,666
The saltiness of it
really stirs the appetite!

96
00:05:23,766 --> 00:05:27,233
Doing physical work always
makes me want something savory.

97
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,900
And this is seaweed, huh?

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,033
It is a staple of onigiri.

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You boiled seaweed in sweet
soy sauce and added cheese!

100
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,566
That's right! A little cheese
actually goes very nicely

101
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,866
with the rich sweetness
of the seaweed.

102
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,566
Okay then, what is
this last one?!

103
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:49,633
[SOMA]
Oh man! This garlic flavor is
so great I can't even stand it!

104
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,300
As you can see, it's just
some garlic‐marinated pork.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,366
Huh?!

106
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:57,966
[MEGUMI]
When I saw you use honey
in our class the other day...

107
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,200
It inspired me.

108
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,800
So I tried changing
it up in my own way.

109
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,766
I boiled some pork belly,

110
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:08,733
then steeped it in a
mixture of garlic, miso,
sake, and honey.

111
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:10,300
It goes great with rice,

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,500
so I chopped it finely
and put it in an onigiri.

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,233
Whoa...

114
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,333
Oh!

115
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,133
[MEGUMI]
There's barley
and green tea, too,

116
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,400
so don't be shy.

117
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,666
(Everyone gasps)

118
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,000
Now this is the true appeal
of Megumi's cooking.

119
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,700
It soothes the heart
of whoever eats it.

120
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,466
The chicken isn't dried out,
and the pork belly is
perfectly tender.

121
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,733
They're all made with such
thought and consideration.

122
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,433
Glad you like it...

123
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,500
Why can't you ever manage to
cook like this in our class?

124
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,533
AHH!

125
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,833
I freak out.

126
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,133
I, uh... I've always
had stage fright.

127
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,766
When I get really nervous,

128
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:55,066
my mind goes blank
and I just mess up
everything in the kitchen.

129
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,733
Yeah, well that's
too bad.

130
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,100
[ISSHIKI]
You need to relax more
in the kitchen, Megumi.

131
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,466
[YUKI]
Totally.

132
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:04,400
The more calm you are,
the better it turns out.

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,266
Just does.

134
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,200
[MEGUMI]
Hehe. I don't know...

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,333
[SOMA]
Huh? A "research society"?

136
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,866
[YUKI]
Yup! There are lots
of them at Tohtsuki,

137
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,600
researching every
theme related to cooking.

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,966
It's fun.

139
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,400
Each group gets
together after class

140
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,366
and works on
developing new menus.

141
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:25,866
Or participates in
cooking contests that
are outside of school.

142
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,500
They're a lot like
club activities,

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,400
much like a regular
school would have.

144
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm a member of
the Regional Cuisine
Research Society.

145
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
Huh...?

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,100
[SOMA]
You weren't kidding.

147
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,266
Japanese, Western,
Russian, Chinese,

148
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:44,333
haute cuisine, vegetarian,
vegan, dairy free...

149
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:47,233
Huh! They even have fermented
and preserved foods.

150
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,366
Boxed lunches at
train stations?!

151
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:53,200
"Rice Bowl
Research Society"?

152
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,033
That could be good
for the restaurant...

153
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,833
Let's go check it out.
Huh?

154
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,700
[SOMA]
Come on, Megumi!

155
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,404
Oh, dear...

156
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:08,771
Huh...

157
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:12,104
Sorry, but you guys
should just beat it.

158
00:08:12,204 --> 00:08:14,071
Bowl‐club's on
its last days.

159
00:08:14,171 --> 00:08:16,004
We are doomed
to get shut down.

160
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,238
[BOTH]
Huh?!

161
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:22,738
[KANICHI]
Soma and Megumi, was it?

162
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,838
I am Kanichi.

163
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,438
I run things around here.

164
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,504
Um, are you
doing okay, buddy?

165
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:30,804
You seem like you're kinda
down in the dumps.

166
00:08:30,904 --> 00:08:32,604
(Sobbing)

167
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:33,904
Feel free to laugh.

168
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:36,704
I couldn't even
protect Bowl‐club.

169
00:08:38,938 --> 00:08:41,438
Look... a recipe book.

170
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,871
Hm?
Looks like menus that
Bowl‐Club members

171
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:45,871
have come up with.

172
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,238
Let's see...

173
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:50,238
They have high‐end items
and off‐the‐wall stuff.

174
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,571
With all their own unique spin.

175
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,204
These recipes look
pretty interesting!

176
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:57,404
Why the heck are you
guys being shut down?

177
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:58,538
Huh?!

178
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,738
You mean you actually get it?!

179
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:02,738
Ahh!

180
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:04,504
You really do,
don't you?!

181
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:05,404
He's crying!

182
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:06,904
[KANICHI]
The rice bowl's beauty

183
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,638
is they're FAST,
TASTY, and CHEAP!

184
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,471
They're pure manliness
encapsulated in a single bowl!

185
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:14,538
It's manly food for men
doing manly things!

186
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,904
And as a man with
manly cravings,

187
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:20,904
I will not die until
I've thoroughly mastered
every last one of them!

188
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,938
He's a little off,
isn't he?

189
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:25,104
Yeah, a bit too
intense for me.

190
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:26,904
My poor Bowl‐club...

191
00:09:27,004 --> 00:09:29,504
If only it weren't
for Erina Nakiri!

192
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:30,671
Erina?

193
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,138
That's right.

194
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,671
This is how she does
things around here.

195
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,371
First off, she'll suggest that
the Council cut the budget

196
00:09:36,471 --> 00:09:39,071
or take space away from
groups she doesn't like.

197
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,904
She'll force the
motion through.

198
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:45,004
She grinds people down
till they've just got
one option left...

199
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:48,504
You know what that is...
A Food War.

200
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,804
[KANICHI]
And in exchange for accepting a
Food War challenge,

201
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,404
she makes a bunch of
outrageous demands,

202
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:58,338
till in the end she gets
exactly what she wants.

203
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,971
It's how she keeps gaining
more and more power!

204
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:07,604
As soon as the other members of
Bowl‐club learned we were up
against Erina, they...

205
00:10:08,304 --> 00:10:10,504
They all friggin' quit!

206
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:13,404
<i>This guy must not</i>
<i>have many friends.</i>

207
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:16,938
M'k... so you're going to
have to face off with Erina?

208
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:17,804
Well...

209
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:18,604
(Door slides open)

210
00:10:18,704 --> 00:10:19,804
[ALL]
Hm?

211
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:24,804
Wha‐?! Hey!

212
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,638
You're absolutely right,
Miss Mito.

213
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:30,704
It's going to be faster to tear
everything down than remodel it.

214
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:32,271
Oh? Then go ahead.

215
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,504
What do you think you're
doing?! What is this?!

216
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:37,238
[IKUMI]
What else? I'm making a
preliminary inspection.

217
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,471
You already know how this is
going to play out, don't you?

218
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,038
Uh! Uhhh!

219
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,304
It's just like
Miss Erina said:

220
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,304
No matter how
you dress it up,

221
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:49,371
a rice bowl is a second‐rate
dish. Simple, lowbrow cooking.

222
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,604
[IKUMI]
You are not needed
here at Tohtsuki.

223
00:10:52,704 --> 00:10:54,171
Got it?
(Chuckles)

224
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,404
But if you think that
you can actually beat me,

225
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:59,438
(Whimpering)
well that would be
whole different story.

226
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:02,371
You follow me,
Mr. Club Captain?

227
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,371
(Jiggle)

228
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:06,171
Your entire club
isn't needed here.

229
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,538
Dammit, Meat‐Meat.

230
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,238
[MEGUMI]
Ah!

231
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:13,904
What the‐?!

232
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:15,838
My name's not "Meat‐Meat".

233
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:17,271
Never call me that again.

234
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:18,471
Don't tell me...

235
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,471
that's who he'll
face in the food war!

236
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,271
Sounds like it. Who is she?

237
00:11:22,371 --> 00:11:23,671
That's Ikumi Mito...

238
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:26,171
the butcher and chef
nicknamed "The Meat Master."

239
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:29,071
She's made top grades
since middle school,

240
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:33,904
and is so good, especially
with meat, that she's gotten
nothing but straight A's.

241
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:38,638
Her intimate knowledge
of meat is as good as it
gets here at the Academy!

242
00:11:38,738 --> 00:11:44,571
When it comes to the power
of meat other ingredients
pale in comparison!

243
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,971
No matter what dish you think
you can prattle together...

244
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,804
it will never match the luster
of my top‐quality meat.

245
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:53,938
Bein' happy about how
much your ingredients cost...

246
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,038
is a disgrace
in my opinion.

247
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,104
Huh?

248
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:58,638
What's that?

249
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:00,238
[SOMA]
Kanichi...

250
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:02,338
About this Food War...

251
00:12:02,438 --> 00:12:04,871
Would you please let
me battle it for you?

252
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:08,771
Why would you bother to
interfere if you're not
even a member‐ Uh?

253
00:12:08,871 --> 00:12:12,804
[IKUMI]
It's you. The transfer idiot
from the opening ceremony.

254
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:16,604
I must say I've been wanting
to have words with you. Hmph.

255
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:19,638
You must be very confident
in your skills

256
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,704
if you're going to suddenly
take on someone else's
fight for them.

257
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:24,004
Or very stupid.

258
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,671
Lets go with your specialty.

259
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,204
We wouldn't want you
to be without your meat.

260
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:30,604
Either way, I'm gonna win.

261
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,371
I don't think so.

262
00:12:33,104 --> 00:12:35,238
And whenever I do beat you...

263
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,904
you will have to
leave Tohtsuki Academy.

264
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:38,871
(Gasp)

265
00:12:38,971 --> 00:12:40,104
Yeah.

266
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:41,538
Y'know, if you don't
have what it takes,

267
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,471
then maybe you shouldn't
be mouthing off.

268
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:43,971
I'm in.

269
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:44,938
What?

270
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:47,671
In exchange,
if I win...

271
00:12:48,338 --> 00:12:49,971
Well, let's see here...

272
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:50,971
You'll have to
join Bowl‐club.

273
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,971
H‐Huh?!

274
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,604
[OTHERS]
HUH?!

275
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:54,871
Yeah, that's right...

276
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:57,438
You'll contribute to the growth
of rice bowl culture.

277
00:12:57,538 --> 00:12:59,971
Sorry if it isn't
really your thing.

278
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,938
You honestly think
you can defeat me?

279
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,104
Hehehe.

280
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,504
(Clap clap)

281
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:09,471
Attention, everyone.
That'll be all for today.

282
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:15,404
Alright. I will allow your
request for the Food War theme.

283
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:20,104
The main ingredient will
be meat, and we'll be
making rice bowls!

284
00:13:20,204 --> 00:13:22,738
The battle will take
place in three days.

285
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,338
Why'd you do that?
Are you crazy?!

286
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,638
Well, thinking expensive
meat is everything

287
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,671
is an insult to mom‐and‐pop
diners everywhere.

288
00:13:31,771 --> 00:13:33,871
But more than anything,

289
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,438
it'd be a shame to
see this place go.

290
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:38,771
You're the coolest!

291
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,004
But, uh, Soma,

292
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:42,471
do you have some sorta
plan for winning?

293
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,138
Guess I better think of one.

294
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,471
Oh dear God!

295
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:51,138
[IKUMI]
<i>I am grateful to Erina for</i>
<i>entrusting me with this.</i>

296
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:57,438
<i>I will teach that</i>
<i>uppity transfer punk the</i>
<i>pleasures of the flesh.</i>

297
00:13:57,538 --> 00:13:59,838
[KANICHI]
A bit to the right.
A little more.

298
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:01,738
Yeah, yeah, That's it.

299
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,338
[YUKI]
Soma's such a big doofus!

300
00:14:07,438 --> 00:14:08,704
What was he thinking?!

301
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,271
The whole stinkin' school
is talking about this!

302
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:13,538
This could go bad! Hmph.

303
00:14:13,638 --> 00:14:14,538
Yuki, settle down.

304
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,871
I'll try to help out
as much as I can.

305
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,838
But there's not a lot of time
until they have their battle.

306
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,338
<i>So then...</i>

307
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:24,404
<i>How will you tackle this,</i>
<i>Young Soma?</i>

308
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:29,771
[KANICHI]
Okay. Here goes...

309
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,171
I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

310
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,504
Meat‐Meat is a specialist
in meat, especially beef.

311
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,971
So, I think we should stay clear
of that particular protein.

312
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:43,204
For example, a
chicken‐and‐egg rice bowl.

313
00:14:43,304 --> 00:14:45,271
That would be within
the battle theme,

314
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,204
but it will still make our
dish different from hers.

315
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,004
That makes sense.

316
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,071
Something outside the box, huh?

317
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,738
Megumi, is there a type
of rice bowl you like?

318
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:58,004
Uh yeah, I don't know if you
could call it a rice bowl,

319
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,871
it's not really
meat, but, uh...

320
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:01,771
I love scallops...
grilling them!

321
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:03,204
And as soon as
they open up...

322
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,404
I pour in a bit of melted
butter and soy sauce.

323
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,704
Then I'll put those on a bed
of fluffy hot rice and it's
absolutely scrumptious!

324
00:15:09,804 --> 00:15:12,604
Well that's a pity.
You could've done
a seafood rice bowl.

325
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,004
But unfortunately
that doesn't count
as a challenge meat...

326
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:16,971
Okay, okay.

327
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,104
The rules are the rules.

328
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:19,804
Please don't
start crying again.

329
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:23,771
You have no idea how
formidable Meat‐Meat can be!

330
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,904
Listen, If she brings out
some of her A5 beef,

331
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:28,138
we're done for!

332
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,271
"A5"? Guess that's good?

333
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,138
It's from a ranking system.

334
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:34,604
And A5 is the highest
quality of beef.

335
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:36,438
Correctamundo!

336
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:43,571
When a cow is broken down,
the cuts are ranked
on fat‐to‐meat ratio...

337
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:47,404
[KANICHI]
There are three rankings,
A to C.

338
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:49,704
Marbling, firmness,
and texture...

339
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,804
The brilliance of the
meat's fattiness!

340
00:15:51,904 --> 00:15:55,204
All these determine a cut of
beef's Marbling Standard!

341
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:57,671
These are ranked from 1 to 5.

342
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,438
(Bell ringing)

343
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:04,204
Meat that has been given
top ranking by these
two standards...

344
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,738
is classified as A5!

345
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:09,571
I once ate one of her steaks
at an Academy function.

346
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,971
Oh man... it was
a whole other level...

347
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,471
It was almost as
if you could...

348
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,538
drink it!

349
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:17,804
Drink it?!

350
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:18,771
Yes!

351
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,138
The moment I bit it...

352
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:22,304
the flavor took on
a life of its own.

353
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,438
It slid softly
down my throat!

354
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:27,471
If something like this
were offered in a restaurant,

355
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,338
the cash would be flying
out of your wallet!

356
00:16:30,438 --> 00:16:33,438
Also... and this is very
important to remember:

357
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,838
Ingredients must be
prepared by the chef.

358
00:16:35,938 --> 00:16:39,604
After all, chefs should be
skilled in food prep, too.

359
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:42,904
The Mito family turned their
wholesale meat business

360
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:44,471
into a massive company,

361
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,604
and have cornered the market
on beef production.

362
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:50,304
Their expertise is
undeniably the best the
industry has to offer.

363
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:52,871
They have money!
They have facilities!

364
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,338
They have distribution routes!

365
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:55,771
They have everything!

366
00:16:55,871 --> 00:17:00,571
And that's why Meat‐Meat has
such badass meat dishes.

367
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,438
He just depressed himself
with his own story...

368
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,538
But can you really beat
such incredible meat?

369
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,438
I mean, what are you
going to do, Soma?

370
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:11,571
[SOMA]
You know...

371
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:12,238
Hm?

372
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,138
I think I got it...

373
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:16,071
we should do a rice
beef bowl too.

374
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,071
Huh?!

375
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:18,238
Are you nuts?

376
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,938
Did you not just
hear what I said?

377
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,238
When it comes
to meat, she is‐

378
00:17:21,338 --> 00:17:23,038
You said it yourself,
Kanichi:

379
00:17:23,138 --> 00:17:25,571
Rice bowls are fast,
tasty, and cheap.

380
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,538
Hm!

381
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:29,338
Her beef will make
a mockery of that.

382
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:30,838
We want bowls
to be respected,

383
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:33,738
we have to win with a menu
using affordable beef.

384
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:37,338
And we're not gonna use any
weird top‐quality ingredients.

385
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:39,271
That's not part of
a rice bowl's appeal.

386
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:43,471
Yeah. Sometimes, even when
a man's convictions are
tested, he must stand tall.

387
00:17:43,571 --> 00:17:46,738
[SOMA] Yeah, well, I'm gonna go
pick up some things.
[KANICHI] Prove to the world
that he is not‐

388
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:48,404
Do you, like,
have a budget?

389
00:17:48,504 --> 00:17:51,038
I'll take whatever
you have left over.

390
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,538
Uh, well...

391
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,338
not so much

392
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,304
(Coin drops)
[MEGUMI]
Huh?

393
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:58,071
[SOMA]
That's it?

394
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,071
(Frantic panting)

395
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:02,904
I'll just have to take it
out of my account!

396
00:18:03,938 --> 00:18:05,138
That's all I have left?!

397
00:18:05,238 --> 00:18:06,871
[ATM]
Your account is now empty.

398
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,871
[JOICHIRO]
I'll wire you some money for
expenses every now and then.

399
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,371
[SOMA]
"Every now and then"?

400
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,838
So I guess that means
never again.

401
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,438
(Sigh)

402
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:18,604
This whole thing
could be a bad idea.

403
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:23,104
[KANICHI]
Oof!
Huh?

404
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,271
These are our best
collected recipes.

405
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,338
There might be somethin'
in here you can use.

406
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:29,271
Here you go,
there's these, too.

407
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,038
[KANICHI]
Oh, thank you!
Set that pile over here.

408
00:18:32,138 --> 00:18:34,504
Okay, guys!
Shall we get to it?

409
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:39,371
[SOMA]
Order up! Give it a try.

410
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:42,771
I used beef instead of pork to
make a "beef cutlet" rice bowl.

411
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,504
I tweaked Bowl‐club's recipe,

412
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:48,138
using a mixture of chicken
and quail eggs to give it
a richer taste.

413
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,638
Ahhh...!

414
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:55,304
That's not bad.
But, it's not enough.

415
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,404
When you put it in your
mouth, you want a reaction.

416
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,771
With Meat‐Meat's food...
it hits your tongue with a bang!

417
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,304
"With a bang," huh?

418
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:03,838
Then we need some fat!

419
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:05,071
(Sizzling)

420
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:06,938
[SOMA]
This is my
"sukiyaki rice bowl,"

421
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,338
cooked in sugar and beef fat
with a raw egg dropped in.

422
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:11,438
Om.

423
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:12,671
Haaahh...!

424
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,804
[KANICHI]
Nah, still not enough!

425
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,471
There's no
refinement to it!

426
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,938
[SOMA]
Then I'll reduce the
beef fat, and instead‐

427
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,638
[MEGUMI]
Um, how about this recipe?

428
00:19:42,404 --> 00:19:44,438
[SOMA]
Okay!

429
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,471
[MEGUMI]
He's so sad, he's
turned white again!

430
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:53,504
Splash some water him
and snap him out of it!

431
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:54,904
Nyah!

432
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,504
[SOMA]
<i>We've tried all of Bowl‐club's</i>
<i>best recipes.</i>

433
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:04,238
<i>I've even tweaked them</i>
<i>in every way I know how.</i>

434
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,538
[MEGUMI]
Hey Soma.

435
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,938
Why don't you try
taking a little break?

436
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:10,438
Once you're all recharged,

437
00:20:10,538 --> 00:20:12,438
you might get another
idea like you did in class.

438
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:14,838
I mean, I'd say it's
worth a shot, right?

439
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:15,838
Don'tcha think?

440
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:16,938
Ah.

441
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,238
Like using honey
to make the meat

442
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,538
more tender, huh?

443
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:20,104
Guh!

444
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:21,538
Megumi!
Uh!

445
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,504
Wh‐what'd I do?

446
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:25,704
You are a genius,
you know that?!

447
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:26,938
You've saved us!

448
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,438
It's been in front
of us the whole time!

449
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,438
It is ALL about
the cheap meat!

450
00:20:30,538 --> 00:20:34,471
Kanichi! Do we have any more
steak cutlets lying around here?

451
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:37,471
I'll take Sirloin or rump.
I have an idea!

452
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,671
Uh!

453
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,371
You need steak cuts?

454
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,971
[SOMA]
Slice the steak into
a grid pattern...

455
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:45,704
then pound it
to spread it out!

456
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:50,438
Next, cover it with
minced onions on both
sides and let it sit.

457
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:52,271
Remove the onions,

458
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:54,671
and season the meat
with salt and pepper.

459
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:57,604
Cook the meat, melting a pat
of butter along with it.

460
00:20:57,704 --> 00:21:02,338
Then caramelize some
onions by cooking them
in the leftover juices.

461
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,571
Why onions?

462
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:12,471
[SOMA]
Then, spread the cooked
onions on top of the meat,
and it's done.

463
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,638
That's...

464
00:21:13,738 --> 00:21:14,804
it's Chaliapin Steak!

465
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:18,571
When opera singer Feodor
Chaliapin came to Japan,

466
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,504
he was suffering
from a toothache.

467
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:23,204
He told his hosts that he
needed very tender steak,

468
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,304
and this is what
the chef came up with.

469
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:26,804
You can't get this overseas!

470
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:30,038
It's a unique style of steak
found only in Japan!

471
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:32,738
Well, give it a taste, you two.

472
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,438
Hm.
Yeah...

473
00:21:42,071 --> 00:21:44,604
(Echoing)
Ahhh...

474
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,938
<i>So light and fluffy...</i>

475
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:50,504
[KANICHI]
It's so tender!

476
00:21:50,604 --> 00:21:53,638
I mean, it's just
falling apart.

477
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:58,004
And with every delicious
bite I take, it...

478
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,538
[BOTH]
...melts in my mouth!

479
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:02,104
(Cows mooing)

480
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,638
The onions contain
enzymes that help break down

481
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:06,138
the meat's protein.

482
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,338
The exact same as
pineapples and honey.

483
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:10,904
That's how the meat is able
to get this tender.

484
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:12,171
[MEGUMI]
Haahhh...

485
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:14,938
<i>You'd never think this</i>
<i>was cheap cut.</i>

486
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:17,304
<i>The flavor is so full</i>
<i>and robust!</i>

487
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:20,338
<i>And it goes great paired</i>
<i>with rice.</i>

488
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:23,238
<i>But, will this really...</i>

489
00:22:23,338 --> 00:22:29,271
<i>Can it do it?</i>
<i>Can we beat her meat?!</i>

490
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:32,871
(Ending Song)

491
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:05,838
[IKUMI]
I will be using fillets
of Kuroge Wagyu.

492
00:24:05,938 --> 00:24:08,871
The quality is, of course, A5.

493
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:10,238
And well...

494
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:12,604
I have aged it for over
a month at this point...

495
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:15,638
giving it the most intense
flavor possible in a steak.

496
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:18,504
[IKUMI]
It is an A5 beyond any other A5.

497
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:21,604
I will make sure
to draw out every
drop of flavor.

498
00:24:21,704 --> 00:24:24,938
That pathetic
"Bowl‐club" will be
crushed in an instant.

499
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,071
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

500
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:29,638
Well, if you'll
excuse me.

501
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:38,138
<i>To think, an opportunity would</i>
<i>come up this quickly...</i>

502
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:39,671
<i>Soma Yukihira...</i>

503
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:44,138
<i>The time has come for you to</i>
<i>leave Tohtsuki Academy.</i>

504
00:24:44,238 --> 00:24:46,571
(Sinister laugh)

505
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,338
[IKUMI]
Next time on Food Wars,

506
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:54,338
it's the seventh course.

507
00:24:55,338 --> 00:24:58,571
"The Silent Bowl,
the Eloquent Bowl"

508
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:02,038
Have a taste.

509
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:05,371
[KANICHI]
That's what I call
a skirt steak!
