[NARRATOR]
Fried chicken...

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:07,066
With rising plumes of steam...

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:09,800
and spices that tickle
the nose...

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,633
The plump texture of the meat...

5
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,866
and the hot juices that
run down one's chin...

6
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:20,733
This is the comfort food that
continues to grace Japanese
tables everywhere.

7
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:26,200
And now, the decisive battle
over it, one fought with knives
and skewers, is about to begin.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,400
Sumire‐dori Shopping District‐

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,600
the Summer Battle
for Fried Chicken!

10
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:12,166
[SOMA]
Let's go check out the enemy!

11
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:15,633
(Obnoxious laugh)

12
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:19,966
I mean, it's not like YOU
could ever make something
this delicious.

13
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:21,766
[SOMA]
What would you say if

14
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:25,466
our shopping area can make a
fried chicken more delicious
than yours...

15
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:29,200
Mozuya would be
totally disgraced!

16
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,633
You sure do talk a big
game there, little boy.

17
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,966
But talking's a lot easier
than cooking, isn't it?

18
00:02:34,066 --> 00:02:37,233
What are you
gonna do, punk?

19
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,200
What is the ideal way for
someone to eat fried chicken?

20
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,500
Uhh...

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,900
Well it's gotta be when
it's piping hot fresh

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,600
right out of the fryer,
of course‐

23
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,800
That's right!

24
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,200
But you see,

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Mozuya's dishes don't
necessarily represent that.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,133
Huh? Meaning what exactly?

27
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,566
The takeout boxes that they send
home with their customers

28
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:03,666
are closed off in order
to keep the heat from escaping.

29
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,366
Those are made assuming
they'll be eaten when
the customer gets home

30
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,666
and not right away when they're
bought at the franchise.

31
00:03:08,766 --> 00:03:12,800
Their customers aren't
opening them up and eating them
in the middle of the station.

32
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,133
Makes sense.
There's no food court
area at the station,

33
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,233
so the only option
they have is takeout.

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,800
However, our shopping area
doesn't have that mentality!

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,600
After all, that's one of
the reasons you come here,
to snack and walk around.

36
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,566
Chomping down on fresh
hot fried goodness...

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,266
And that, my friends, is when
fried chicken is at its best!

38
00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:33,600
Plus we've got plenty
of starving school kids

39
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,500
that need something quick,
easy, and portable.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,633
That's brilliant!

41
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,600
We don't have to fight
on their terms at all.

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,533
We will offer fresh hot,
ready‐made food for takeout.

43
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:45,000
We can use this location
to its full advantage!

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,933
Exactly right!

45
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:49,066
The keyword is...

46
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,366
"Fried chicken for
eating and walking"!

47
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:54,466
I'm feeling pretty good
about our chances.

48
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:55,233
Yeah!

49
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,933
[TOMITA]
Woohoo! YEAH!

50
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,100
WOOOOOOHOO! Now you
got me all fired up!

51
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,800
I'm on it! I'm going to make a
new exciting dish as well!

52
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,200
Huh?

53
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,033
'Cause after all,
I am a lunchtime expert.

54
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:11,933
With everyone's help,
we'll take those suckers down!

55
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,266
All right, people!
Let's do this thang!

56
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,766
Yeah, good luck with
that, Mr. Tomita.

57
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:24,133
[KINU]
The All‐Japan Fried Chicken
Championship!

58
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,866
We've won the gold medal
three years in a row, folks.

59
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,566
Because we're Mozuya!

60
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,566
Step on up and get
yourself the best‐fried
chicken in all the land!

61
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,166
Um, excuse me, Miss Kinu.

62
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,033
We've received the invoice from
the consultant for this month.

63
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:41,233
[KINU]
Maybe I should just be done with
that four‐eyed dweeb for good.

64
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,900
I can't keep paying all
his ridiculous fees anyway.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,066
Are you okay, Ma'am?

66
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,800
Nothing that
concerns you!

67
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,833
<i>As long as Mozuya has its</i>
<i>secret marinade, we're all set.</i>

68
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:55,066
<i>True, we are now set up in this</i>
<i>impregnable chicken fortress</i>

69
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,933
<i>thanks to that dork...</i>

70
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,633
<i>But this fortress is now mine!</i>

71
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,733
<i>All right! Let's get ready</i>
<i>for another day</i>

72
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:05,766
<i>of sucking the delicious</i>
<i>dinero out of the city!</i>

73
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:07,933
<i>Mwahahaha!</i>

74
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,700
[SOMA]
A package so you
can eat it on the spot.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
Then add some toothpicks...

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,166
Something like this, maybe?

77
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:16,566
You plan on
reusing milk cartons?

78
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:17,666
Ohh!

79
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:18,933
Elementary and
middle‐school kids

80
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,100
seem to like to eat
fried chicken, so...

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,833
I've got one flavored
with curry powder

82
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:26,566
and another with some
gooey grated cheese
melted all over it.

83
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,566
[SOMA]
What do you think?

84
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,000
Delicious!

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,000
Both the curry and the cheese
are great! But, uh...

86
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,433
I feel like Mozuya's chicken
was still more satisfying in
taste and texture.

87
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,966
So, um... well...

88
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,066
I don't think this quite
measures up yet.

89
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,666
Oh, alright...

90
00:05:55,766 --> 00:05:58,100
Putting it in a package
and having you eat
it with toothpicks

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,700
makes the serving
size feel small.

92
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,733
It pales to the in‐your‐face
meatiness of Mozuya's.

93
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:06,733
And the flavorings are only
concentrated on the surface.

94
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,500
We've gotta bring out the
quality of the ingredients
throughout.

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,166
Ah! What about if we
tried putting the fried
chicken on a stick?

96
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,466
You could eat it with one
hand and not be messy!

97
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:18,666
Uhhh... chicken‐on‐a‐stick
is a pretty common concept.

98
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:22,033
It doesn't really
scream that it's
something different.

99
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,400
Oh... Okay...

100
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,700
We need packaging that's not
only new and unique,

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
BUT will also be able
to draw out more flavors.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,866
There has got to be some idea
out there to solve both problems
at the same time.

103
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:35,233
Got it!

104
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,766
I've got a bunch of
notebooks

105
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,733
where I wrote
recipes down as a kid.

106
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,600
They're in my room.

107
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,600
<i>He's going to his room?</i>

108
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,166
<i>Soma's room...</i>

109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,333
<i>Ah! It's just the two of us!</i>

110
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,433
<i>I‐I have to try and say</i>
<i>something! Uh, uh...</i>

111
00:06:54,533 --> 00:06:55,800
U‐um, Ms. Meat!

112
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,966
Whattayou want?!

113
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,066
Um, um... Are...

114
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:02,200
How are you enjoying
the curriculum so far?

115
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,366
Huh?

116
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,566
<i>Ah! N‐no!</i>

117
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,333
<i>I wanted to ask what</i>
<i>Soma is like at school,</i>

118
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:09,133
<i>and ended up saying</i>
<i>something that sounds like</i>

119
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,133
<i>it's from a letter from</i>
<i>a middle‐school teacher!</i>

120
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>I'm such a hopeless wreck.</i>
<i>Soma please come and save me.</i>

121
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:18,033
<i>Just relax...</i>
<i>This girl has known Soma</i>
<i>since middle school...</i>

122
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,033
Uh, well...

123
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:20,600
<i>They're childhood friends?</i>

124
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,133
How are you...
um...

125
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,566
<i>Why am I getting so mad?!</i>

126
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,300
<i>Recover, recover!</i>

127
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,433
Um, you must be incredible
too, Meat‐Meat.

128
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,066
To think, you're in the
strictest cooking school
in all of Japan.

129
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:36,333
There's nothing
remotely special
about me at all...

130
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,966
It's not really
a big deal.

131
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,500
A lot of worthless
punks go there.

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,300
I mean real
good‐for‐nothing bastards

133
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,066
whose level is
nowhere close to mine!

134
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,966
Just thinking about
it makes my blood boil!

135
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,266
I swear, some of 'em are
absolutely worthless!

136
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,966
Get bowled over by
Bowl‐club, baby!

137
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:51,400
O‐oh...

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,733
Still...

139
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,533
Soma's at least... a little
better than most of them.

140
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:57,933
Sorta...

141
00:07:58,033 --> 00:07:59,300
<i>Oh no!</i>

142
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,200
<i>Please don't tell me</i>
<i>this girl likes Soma?</i>

143
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,000
<i>I have no chance.</i>

144
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:04,700
Uh! Meat‐Meat!

145
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,033
Oh, sorry! Are you okay
under there, Meat‐Meat?

146
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:10,866
What the hell are you doing?!
You're such an idiot!
I said I was sorry, okay?

147
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,033
DAMMIT! AAHHHH!

148
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:15,700
<i>Or maybe I'm just</i>
<i>imagining things...</i>

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,500
This is by far the juiciest
of any of them yet!

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,666
That's right!

151
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,166
Mozuya uses all breast meat

152
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,800
which is low in calories
and has very little fat content.

153
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
True, that does make
it a bit more popular
with the diet crowd,

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,666
But if you want the
knockout punch of
fresh‐fried taste...

155
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:40,733
You've gotta use thigh meat
to get the juices!

156
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,200
[MAYU]
Yes! It's the perfect size
and it's so succulent!

157
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,133
Even at Western fried
chicken places...

158
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:49,366
drumsticks are by far the most
popular pick with the kids.

159
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,600
So using dark meat will get
the students drooling

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,833
and wanting more!

161
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,933
Nice! You ARE
the Meat Master!

162
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:55,933
Cut it out.

163
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,933
<i>"Meat Master"?</i>

164
00:08:58,033 --> 00:09:00,300
<i>Oh! Because she's</i>
<i>Ms. Meat‐Meat.</i>

165
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,200
We're going to need
a really special marinade
for our chicken.

166
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Let's use a base
of soy sauce and
Ichimi‐pepper seasoning.

167
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,066
And, to get the right
batter, we should try
using some cornstarch.

168
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,100
Ah! Yeah I don't
have any of that.

All right. Looks like our
flavors are now coming together.

175
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:31,600
Yeah. Now to figure out how we
want people to eat our food.

Soma!

177
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,700
What's going on, Mr. Tomita?

178
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,933
With this I needed to sneak
in through the back entrance.

179
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,033
Sneak in?

180
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,500
I've finally discovered it!

181
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,766
The perfect dish for the
concept of walking and eating!

182
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:48,533
This radical dish captures
all the knowledge of

Here is it! Behold!

184
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,366
A fried chicken onigiri!

185
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,333
People already
sell this, you know?

186
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:56,000
They make them
in convenience stores.

187
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,000
AhhhhHHHH!

188
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm so embarrassed!
<i>Such a waste of space.</i>

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,933
I thought it was
a hit for sure...

190
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:11,033
I mean, fried chicken
and rice is the ultimate
combination. Right?

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,100
<i>Something new with impact...</i>

192
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,766

193
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,266
<i>and that elevates the flavor.</i>

You, sir, are a genius,
Mr. Tomita!

195

Huh? You think so?

196
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:22,933
Um. No, not that.

197

It's gonna work!
We can pull this off!

In kindergarten,

Soma started making his
own disgusting lunches

216
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,200
and feeding them to his friends,

217
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,733
making them burst into tears.

218
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,033
Not a lot's changed since then.

219
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,722
[KINU]
Now then...

220
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:21,822
It'll be dinnertime soon,

00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,889
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Our club activities
were tough today.

[SCHOOLBOY 2]
I know right.

223
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:28,222
I was starving and
I still had like
an hour left to go.

224
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,256
What is that?

00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,689
<i>What are those boys holding?</i>

<i>Is that fried chicken?</i>

227
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,422
No, it couldn't be.

228
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:40,189
No fried chicken could
possibly make you want to
buy it more than Mozuya!

229
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:42,122
No worries, no worries.

230
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:46,389

proper customer service,

Is this the fried chicken place
with the "Sumire Mark" on it?

246
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:30,822

the shopping area in

Understood!
Working on it now.

267
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,322
This original marinade is
mainly soy sauce and ichimi
pepper seasoning,

268
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,422
We added big chunks
of thigh meat to soak
throughout the day.

I'm done with the
batter, too!

<i>Finally, we add lettuce</i>

and others are moist
from absorbing the sauce...

The hardware store gave
us the cooking equipment.

Shut up, you twit!

338
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:36,922
What's so friggin' special
about your fried chicken?!

339
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,222
Sooner or later, Mozuya
is going to crush you‐

Well don't say that...

341
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:41,622
What?

342
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,589
Unless you're gonna
try some, Grandma.

343
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:45,322
It's, like, crazy delish.

344
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:46,856
Where are your parents,
young man?

345
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,222
And who are you calling
"Grandma"?!

346
00:16:49,322 --> 00:16:50,522
Oh, that's right.

347
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,856
Last time we met,
you let me try a sample.

348
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,856
Care to have a taste
of our fried chicken?

349
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,522
It's really tasty.

350
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,289

<i>It uses rice flour!</i>

354
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:16,156
<i>Dear Lord...</i>
<i>It's like a... banh xeo!</i>

[NARRATOR]
Banh xeo: a Vietnamese
batter‐based delight.

356
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:23,189
The batter uses rice flour,
water, and coconut milk.

357
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:29,289
It is lightly fried and stuffed
with ingredients such as pork,
shrimp, and bean sprouts.

358
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,456
<i>It's so simple!</i>

359

at the bottom of the ninth,
two outs, full count.

Here's the wind up...

[SOMA]
You were awesome, Meat‐Meat.
Big time.

378
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:52,689
Man. That marinade was
perfect. You really nailed it!

379
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:55,322
I want you to keep teaching
me cool stuff like that, okay?

380
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,722
Um, yeah, okay,
if I'm not too busy.

like to maybe, uh...

386
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:15,789
Y‐yeah?

387
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:18,522
...would you like to work
part‐time with Tomita?

388
00:19:18,622 --> 00:19:20,289
Huh?!

389
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,589
It's going to take
a lot of hard work

390
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,056
to get that fried
chicken roll famous!

391
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:26,156
I'm worried about him
being on his own.

392
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,256
And I won't be able to help out
very much.

393
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:31,889
Um. Oh, I don't know. I've never
worked a part‐time job before!

394
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,656
There must be someone
more suited than me.

395
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,556
You've got a strong sense of
responsibility,

396
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:39,122
so I'm betting I could
trust you with this.

397
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,689
Huh?

398
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,322
[SOMA]
Back in middle school,

399
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:45,089
you used to work late doing
things for the student council.

400
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:50,056
Even in elementary school,
you never skipped your turn
to water the flowerbeds.

401
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:53,956
I'd feel better knowing
you were here keeping an
eye on things.

<i>I thought Soma was someone</i>

<i>But he noticed me?</i>

404
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:04,056
Well, I don't wanna force you‐

405
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:06,022
I'll try to do my best!

406
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,956
Really?! Great!

407
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:11,689
I'll be back in town to air‐out
the shop every once in a while,

408
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:13,622
and then we can hang out more.

409
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:14,922
I'll even cook for ya!

410
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:16,056
Yeah, sure!

411
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,856
Ahhhhhh!

412
00:20:17,956 --> 00:20:20,656
Uh... What's wrong, Meat‐Meat?

413
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,522
Nothing at all.

<i>I'm sure you want to know</i>
<i>all about it.</i>

418

One, two...

419
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:40,122
An unbelievable score
of 20 out of 10!

[EIZAN]
Sales have been plummeting

'Kay then... Can you explain?

422
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,989
What exactly is
happening at Mozuya?

[SOMA] (Stretch)
Man, so much for
a relaxing vacation.

424
00:22:24,822 --> 00:22:26,889
That was over so fast!

425
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:31,789
What the hell?
What do you want?

426
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:34,222
You're Soma Yukihira, right?

427
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:35,789
Come with me.

428
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:43,022
Hello there.

429
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:46,089
So, who are you?

430
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:48,989
I hear you've created a
new fried chicken roll.

431
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:51,922
And that it's a
rather interesting dish.

432
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:56,422
I'm the one who oversaw
Mozuya's expansion into Kanto.

433
00:22:56,522 --> 00:22:58,389
And it's not
just Mozuya.

434
00:22:58,489 --> 00:22:59,689
Since my middle
school year,

435
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,589
I've consulted for
over 500 restaurants,

436
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:04,922
bringing in record‐breaking
profits for every single
one of them.

437
00:23:05,022 --> 00:23:09,489
I've been told it was
you who got the shopping
arcade back on its feet.

438
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:12,389
My strategy is ruined
because of your play.

439
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:15,222
And? You want to take
me out or something?

440
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,456
No.

441
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:18,089
I want you to work for me.

442
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:21,489
Do so, and you
will never need to
look for a job again.

443
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:25,656
I've got my eye on being the
successor to my family
restaurant back home.

444
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:29,856
I have no interest in being
anybody's pet monkey, okay?

445
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:33,789
Hmph. Well I didn't actually
think you'd go for it.

446
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:35,422
Not with you reputation.

447
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:36,822
Huh?

448
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,156
A talented chef shut within
his own little box...

449
00:23:39,256 --> 00:23:42,756
who feels satisfaction simply
by the pride in his work.

450
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,489
It's just a tiny little
shop, isn't that right?

451
00:23:45,589 --> 00:23:49,622
Has being born into such
a modest household hindered
your culinary ambitions?

452
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:50,889
Well?

453
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,856
You sure do talk a big game...

454
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:55,256
But you're not even a real chef,
I mean how can you even‐?

455
00:23:55,356 --> 00:23:56,956
Not true.

456
00:23:57,056 --> 00:24:00,622
I am the one whom all chefs
look up to and aspire to be.

457
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,556
I'm standing on a far
greater stage than you.

458
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:06,889
Soma Yukihira, I'm
letting you know.

459
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:10,289
You've been chosen to compete
at the Fall Selection.

460
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:13,989
However, I wouldn't get
too excited if I were you.

461
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,822
Being selected means these
antics of yours are over.

462
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,722
No one is going to
blemish my career.

463
00:24:19,822 --> 00:24:24,256
In the culinary world,
I go by a nickname...

464
00:24:24,356 --> 00:24:26,856
You've heard of me, I'm sure.

465
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:29,222

There is no greater
stage than this,

469
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,256
and I look forward
to crushing you.

Next time, on Tomita‐style
Boxed Lunches...
