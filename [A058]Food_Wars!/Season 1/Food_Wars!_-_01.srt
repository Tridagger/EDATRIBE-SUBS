174
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,500
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Wanna do some karaoke?

175
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,866
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Yeah. What're
you gonna sing?

176
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,633
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Anime songs, duh.

177
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,066
[AKI]
Mayu! C'mon!

178
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,700
Oh!
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
Don't you know anything else.

179
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,866
Like, some glam rock, maybe?

180
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:49,200
(Crows cawing)

181
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:53,666
(Phone vibrating)
Hm?

182
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:57,033
Hey, Dad. What's up?

183
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,033
[JOICHIRO]
<i>You back already?</i>

184
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,700
No, I was buying some
stuff for breakfast. Why?

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,933
[JOICHIRO]
<i>I need to go on a</i>
<i>little errand today.</i>

186
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,366
Huh? Oh yeah?

187
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:11,366
<i>I won't be back till</i>
<i>tomorrow, so don't bother</i>
<i>opening up the shop.</i>

188
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,033
Okay...

189
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,366
Son...
Huh?

190
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:17,800
<i>What are your plans after</i>
<i>this school year?</i>

191
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,466
Uh...

192
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:23,300
What else? Practice cooking
with you at the shop.

193
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,433
<i>I see.</i>

194
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,100
(Phone hangs up)

195
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,266
[SOMA]
That was weird.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,566
[SOMA]
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

197
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:34,400
<i>What "errand" could make</i>
<i>my dad close the shop?</i>

198
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:38,833
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what it would be.</i>

199
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,100
<i>I guess when it</i>
<i>comes down to it,</i>

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,000
<i>I don't really know all</i>
<i>that much about my Dad's</i>
<i>life outside the kitchen.</i>

201
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,533
<i>Or his past for that matter.</i>

202
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,166
Ah!

203
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,166
[SOMA]
<i>The meat!</i>

204
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:58,966
<i>It's all ruined!</i>

205
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,833
<i>And everything in</i>
<i>the fridge...</i>

206
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,600
<i>Did we get robbed?</i>

207
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>No, it doesn't look like it.</i>

208
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,100
AH!

209
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,566
(Splat)

210
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:15,366
(Gasp)

211
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,600
[YAEKO]
Oh, you poor thing.

212
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,833
But you know, it does
look much nicer out here
than it did yesterday.

213
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:25,833
Perhaps it's because
that eyesore of a sign
has been covered up.

214
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:31,166
Ah, I'm in the mood to indulge
in a big thick juicy steak...

215
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,500
I always like to have one
while in Roppongi.

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,333
Something nice and marbled,
of course.

217
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:39,000
Where the natural flavors merge
together in luscious harmony.

218
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,333
(Sizzling)
There's really nothing
in the world quite like it.

219
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,133
[YAEKO]
So, little man...

220
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,733
I'd like to place an order.

221
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:52,466
I would like for you to give me
a thick and juicy cut of meat.

222
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,866
What? Don't tell me
you can't make it for me.

223
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,133
But I'm a paying customer.

224
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:02,533
[YAEKO]
I think I remember you
saying something yesterday.

225
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,533
Hmm. What was it? Oh...

226
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,133
That if you can't provide
what the customer needs,

227
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,966
then you would
close your doors.

228
00:11:09,066 --> 00:11:11,133
Oh! Perhaps your signage
is just right.

229
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,900
Looks like you've
already started.

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,400
I suppose you'll be
clearing everything out
of the dining area next.

231
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,300
(Cackle)

232
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,833
(Exhale)

233
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,733
[SOMA]
You want a juicy meat dish...?

234
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,233
Uh?

235
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:28,033
[SOMA]
Will that complete your
order for today, ma'am?

236
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,833
(Swishing)

237
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:33,133
Well just sit tight, and I'll
have it right out for you.

238
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:37,366
And then you will never come in
this restaurant ever again!

239
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:38,366
Ah!

240
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,533
(All stammering)

241
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:47,266
(Monster growl)

242
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:50,133
Order up!

243
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:06,733
Heh.

244
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:12,166
(Chopping and dicing)

245
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,500
(Roaring)

246
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,933
(Escaping steam)

247
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:22,033
(Sizzling)

248
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,766
(Dishes clatter)

249
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,733
(Strong impact)

250
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,100
(Men gasp)

251
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait a second...

252
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,133
You did take everything
out of the fridge, right?

253
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,466
Uh‐huh! We ruined every single
last piece of meat in there.

254
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:44,300
I‐I distinctly requested a
thick and juicy meat dish!

255
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,546
What exactly is this kid going
to make without any fresh meat?

256
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,580
(Fwip fwip)

257
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,980
(Sizzling)

258
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,613
(Gasp)

259
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:15,546
How could he...

260
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:16,646
...possibly make...

261
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:18,613
...such a wonderful...

262
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:20,480
[YAEKO]
...pork roast?!

263
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,480
Well I can tell ya...

264
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,246
this here is actually a potato.

265
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,846
I wrapped it with some
thick‐cut bacon I had for
tomorrow's breakfast.

266
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:30,413
It's what I call a
"pseudo pork roast"!

267
00:13:30,513 --> 00:13:31,446
(Gasp)

268
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:32,580
Did he say a potato?

269
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,213
A "Pseudo"...

270
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,346
..."pork roast"?

271
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:36,680
Yep. That's right.

272
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,346
First, I steamed
the potatoes, and‐

273
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,646
[YAEKO]
Whatever, kid...

274
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:42,580
Uh. What's up? Is
there a problem here?

275
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,913
Are you trying to
pull one over on me?

276
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:45,846
Uhh!

277
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:47,880
I told you to make
me a MEAT dish!

278
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,680
There's no room for
negotiation on this!

279
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,746
If you can't provide,
you close your shop!

280
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:56,046
Look here! All my head chefs
are highly respected

281
00:13:56,146 --> 00:13:58,813
and make their livings
at top‐notch restaurants

282
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:01,980
and first‐rate hotels
that I'VE put together!

283
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,780
This place is a dump!

284
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,446
[YAEKO]
And from where I'm sitting...

285
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:08,013
There's no value in
this failure existing!

286
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,346
Oh!

287
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:12,446
If you want to see the
"value" in Yukihira...

288
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:15,146
Then you will quickly
learn it from this dish.

289
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,546
Please, eat up!

290
00:14:24,513 --> 00:14:27,780
(Heavy breath)
(Gasp)

291
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Ooh!

292
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,046
Aaah...

293
00:14:37,513 --> 00:14:39,913
(Stunned)

294
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,546
(Steam hisses)

295
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,513
(Quick inhale)

296
00:14:55,413 --> 00:14:57,246
Ahh...

297
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,013
Om...

298
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:03,580
(Sensuous moaning)

299
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,180
<i>Each time I bite down...</i>

300
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,346
<i>the savory juices</i>
<i>from the slow‐cooked bacon...</i>

301
00:15:08,446 --> 00:15:11,413
<i>overflow to every corner</i>
<i>of my mouth!</i>

302
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:20,213
(Whimpers and squeals)

303
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:25,680
It looks like somebody's
enjoying their meal.
(Gasp)

304
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,213
[SOMA]
From the very restaurant
you were just insulting.

305
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:30,613
(Yaeko gasps)

306
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:31,846
Shall I tell you...?

307
00:15:31,946 --> 00:15:34,846
The secret to
its flavor.

308
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:40,513
[SOMA]
Once the potatoes
are nice and soft...

309
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:43,780
I grabbed some fibrous mushrooms
to soak up the fat.

310
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,346
Then, I diced up some onion

311
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,480
to bump up the sweetness, and
then kneaded both of them in.

312
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,980
Next, I wrapped it with
the thick‐cut bacon.

313
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,746
Then I slowly cooked
it in the oven.

314
00:15:56,846 --> 00:15:59,546
That made the bacon
nice and crispy.

315
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,613
That's when the potato
and mushrooms did their thing,

316
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:07,513
and soaked up all
the tasty bacony goodness.

317
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,580
Which in turn...

318
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
created the beautiful
combination of

319
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,180
crispy‐on‐the‐outside
and juicy in the middle.

320
00:16:16,646 --> 00:16:19,380
Almost "sensual,"
don'tcha think?

321
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,113
(All groaning)

322
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:26,146
[SOMA]
Awhile back, when I was making a
potato salad for a customer...

323
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,946
I messed up the plating,

324
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:33,146
and the juices from the
protein accidently seeped
into the potato salad.

325
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:36,746
That's where I got the
inspiration for this dish...

326
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:38,580
It came from my "failure."

327
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,646
(Gasp) Uh, well...

328
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,580
It's not as if... this thing...

329
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,480
can be called a meat dish!

330
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,980
(Struggling)
But... I can't...

331
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,080
I can't stop!

332
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,513
Ah. Ahh!

333
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,980
(Hard exhale)

334
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,446
I wan't more!

335
00:16:57,546 --> 00:17:01,546
It's so... so succulent!

336
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,146
Ah!

337
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:04,780
Uh, what?
What are you doing?

338
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,480
If you want to have more,
you'll have to make me
a promise.

339
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,380
(Sizzling)
That you won't come after
this restaurant again.

340
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,146
Hah! I don't think so, kid!

341
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,013
Okeedokee...

342
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:17,346
[SOMA]
I guess this wasn't
good enough then.

343
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,546
Oh well...

344
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:19,780
(Flunkies gasp)

345
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,880
[SOMA]
I'll just have
to throw it out!

346
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,213
[YAEKO]

Hey, Pops!

376
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,797
What in the world
happened here?

377
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:39,697
It wasn't really
that big a deal.

378
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:43,530
We just had a few customers
who were being kinda rude.

00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,730
Huh?

For a couple of years,
I'm afraid...

382
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,863
...we'll have to
shut down the shop.

383
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,563

back up soon.

I'll have to apologize
to our regulars.

Apologize to your SON!

388
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,830
An old colleague of
mine has contacted me

389
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,697
about wanting to
work together again.

I'm going to be
very busy for awhile,

Wait.

397
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:32,397
I'll wire you some money for
expenses every now and then.

398
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,530
I said wait!

go, too, Soma.

[JOICHIRO]
The timing's right.

407
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:04,730
The shop will be closed,
and it'll give you a chance

408
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,030
to earn credits
for high school.

409
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,897

It'll be some good
practice for you.

to cook is just stupid.

drops on your face!
