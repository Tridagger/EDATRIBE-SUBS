1
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:19,333
[P.A.]
Flight 1704 to Osaka is now
boarding on concourse E.

2
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,600
Now then, let's begin
the final segment of this
training camp's program.

3
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,600
Please, enjoy a full‐course
dinner served up by our
highly esteemed graduates.

4
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,433
(Cheers)

5
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,333
MMMmmm!

6
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:36,115
[P.A.]
Attention all students:

7
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,881
please collect your luggage
and board your assigned buses.

8
00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:42,015
Be sure to return your room
keys to the front desk.

9
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:45,681
And please double check you've
left nothing behind.

10
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:48,581
[YUKI]
Mmmm! Yes!

11
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,815
Finally it's all done!

12
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,848
And all of us managed
to make it out.

13
00:02:53,948 --> 00:02:55,115
Yeah!
Totes!

14
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:57,948
It almost seems like it
was over before it started!

15
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,248
True enough.

16
00:02:59,348 --> 00:03:01,015
It sure was tough, though.

17
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,581
[YUKI]
Got that right!

18
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,648
Was it really necessary
for everyone

19
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:06,881
to meet up in my room
every single freaking night?

20
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,715
Come on, you know you
had a good time too!

21
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,881
Gah!
(Snoring)

22
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,215
You had fun last night,
I saw you...

23
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,381
Go on and draw.

24
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,615
The old maid's waiting!

25
00:03:15,715 --> 00:03:17,115
Let's pick up
this game later!

26
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:19,548
[ZENJI] What?!
[SATO] Totally, we can
invite Issihiki.

27
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:21,881
[AOKI]
And we'll start a new game!

28
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,248
[SOMA]
Chef Kojiro Shinomiya!

29
00:03:26,515 --> 00:03:28,781
So you both
made it, huh?

30
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:32,048
Yeah, we still seem
to be standing.

31
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:33,948
Chef Kojiro...

32
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,115
Take it you're already
heading back to France?

33
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,448
Yeah. I can't keep my restaurant
closed forever, y'know.

34
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,415
Also, I know now
what I need to do.

35
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:46,781
The next time you hear from
me, I'll have the most famous
spot in Paris,

36
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,748
and I'll have three stars.

37
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,315
There's still so much
I want to do...

38
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:55,215
It's gotten to where having
the Brousse‐Poiret Award
just isn't enough anymore.

39
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,315
Know what I mean?

40
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,148
Three stars...

41
00:03:58,248 --> 00:03:59,315
Amazing!

42
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,781
No Japanese chef
working in France

43
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:03,881
has ever been awarded
three stars before!

44
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,115
Not yet...

45
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:08,548
No, no, NOO!
Urgh!

46
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,181
I will not let you
just leave us all

47
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:11,515
for France again!

48
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,448
What are you talking about,
you insane woman?

49
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:15,381
Hey, listen here, kid.

50
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:17,515
Are you interested
in Italian cooking?

51
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:21,781
Um, Megumi... I think your
skills might grow a great deal
at a sushi restaurant‐

52
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:22,715
Oh, NO!

53
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,448
I am taking Megumi
back with me

54
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:25,815
and treating her right!

55
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,248
Wh‐what?

56
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:32,248
Well... I see they've
gotten to you already.

57
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,981
Uh, Chef Dojima!
What's going on?!

58
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,915
Well this is part
of your assessment.

59
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,415
What assessment?

60
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:41,581
This training camp also allows
us to recruit some new personnel

61
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,415
once they've graduated
from Tohtsuki academy.

62
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:47,081
Some former graduates will take
time off from their restaurants

63
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,281
and come to work as sous‐chefs
adding to their skill‐set.

64
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:53,815
This serves as a place where
chefs can recruit new talent.

65
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:56,315
[SENA]
Finding promising chefs
is not an easy task.

66
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:58,215
So this is a good way to search.

67
00:04:58,315 --> 00:04:59,948
Ooh, that makes sense.

68
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:03,381
Is that what the training
camp was about all along?

69
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,415
Check it out. Megumi
still doesn't get why

70
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:07,381
those chefs are trying
to recruit her.

71
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,948
Mm‐hmm! Mm‐hmm!

72
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:10,115
Y'know Soma.

73
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,515
You could find your place
working at the Resort.

74
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,515
You're welcome here anytime.

75
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:18,548
I'm extremely honored
to hear that, but I've got
"Yukihira" to look after.

76
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:20,148
[GIN]
I see.

77
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:22,848
You already have a job
waiting for you somewhere?

78
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,981
Yeah! My dad and I run a small
restaurant together back home.

79
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:29,548
I'm not exactly sure where
he is right now, but...

80
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:32,981
one day, I'm sure
I'll get his approval.

81
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:36,515
I will be the chef that
keeps "Yukihira" going!

82
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:56,981
Hey, Kojiro, you're really
going for three stars?

83
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,481
Well somebody has to.

84
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:01,448
What do you say I go
over there and help you
accomplish that goal?

85
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:02,915
Yeah, works for me.

86
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,115
I'm sure I could use a new
busboy to help mop up.

87
00:06:05,215 --> 00:06:07,681
What?! HEY!

88
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:11,581
Huh?!

89
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,715
Chef Dojima?

90
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,348
Is something wrong, Sir?

91
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,981
Uh... Of course not.

92
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:41,181
Thanks for all of your help.
Guess I'll see you
back at the dorm.

93
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,515
Yeah, see you later.

94
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,648
Oh, no! My hand towel!

95
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,981
[HISAKO]
What? You forgot something?

96
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:52,181
No, no, no, NO!
But we're just about to leave.

97
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,448
I'll go get it for you‐
It's not a problem.

98
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,815
I'll get it myself.

99
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,115
Oh, and I'll find my own
way back to the academy.

100
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:01,381
Could you be a doll and take my
luggage for me? Thank you!

101
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:03,081
[HISAKO]
O‐okay.

102
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,281
Thank goodness, I found it!

103
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:12,481
(Jabbering)
We sure got our fill at
Tohtsuki's Resort this time.

104
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,148
I'm lookin' forward
to next year!

105
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,115
<i>I'm on the wrong bus...</i>

106
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:19,848
[P.A.]
When several express buses
are gathered together,

107
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:22,148
it's quite easy to get confused.

108
00:07:22,248 --> 00:07:23,681
When leaving the bus,

109
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,481
please be sure to remember
the vehicle number

110
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,115
and where it was parked.

111
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:28,315
[TOKUZO]
Oh!

112
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,981
You're the one who
made the wonderful

113
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,281
souffle omelets.

114
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,715
Ah! You're the egg man!

115
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:36,081
[TOKUZO]
That was exceptionally
done, young man.

116
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:38,748
[SOMA]
Uh...

117
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:42,181
I wasted so many eggs!
I'm sorry, Sir!

118
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,548
Hmm...
That's fine by me...

119
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:51,581
So long as after you
graduate, you plan on
using Tokuzo Brand eggs.

120
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:56,648
For the restaurant you'll
surely one day own, right?

121
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:59,148
Right!

122
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:01,615
And you must promise to
use my green beans too!

123
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,581
And of course
my cheese, as well.

124
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,515
Want some rice crackers,
young man?

125
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:06,748
Here, have some candy.

126
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:09,348
Ah, thank you.
Thanks very much. Thanks.

127
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,348
Look, people! I don't really
have the time for this, okay!

128
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:14,181
Where's my bus?!

129
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:16,715
Uh... Um...

130
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,115
<i>They left me!</i>

131
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:23,615
<i>For real?</i>

132
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:25,715
<i>I survive the whole training</i>
<i>camp from hell</i>

133
00:08:25,815 --> 00:08:28,081
<i>just to go out like this?</i>

134
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,348
Ah! Why are you
still here?!

135
00:08:31,448 --> 00:08:32,715
Aw, you care?

136
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,581
Well this and that happened,

137
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,248
and the next thing you know
there was the bus...

138
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:37,481
Miss Erina!

139
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,181
We were able to arrange
a car for you.

140
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,815
Luckily there was
still one left in the
parking garage. Oh!

141
00:08:41,915 --> 00:08:44,848
[STAFF]
Did you miss the bus
as well, young man?

142
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,215
Want some rice crackers?

143
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,881
I don't eat those.

144
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:05,581
Some candy?

145
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,015
Are you serious?

146
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,015
Come to think of it...

147
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,681
You said you looked forward
to seeing me fail

148
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,115
one of these days,
didn't you?

149
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:14,881
But it looks like you
can't get rid of me, can ya?

150
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:19,081
<i>I am not even going to look</i>
<i>at his stupid smug face!</i>

151
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:21,048
<i>HEHEHEHEHE!</i>

152
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:24,481
Go ahead, keep floundering
around on the edge if you want.

153
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:28,048
There's no way you'll be picked
to be a member of the Selection.

154
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:28,981
"Selection"?

155
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:30,548
You don't even know
what that is.

156
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:32,348
It's Tohtsuki's legendary...

157
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,248
?Fall Selection.

158
00:09:34,348 --> 00:09:36,148
It's a festival where the chosen
few

159
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:38,481
show their skills in a battle of
fine cuisine.

160
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:42,715
It's the first opportunity
for students to display
their abilities off campus,

161
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:47,548
in front of the academy's
directors and investors, all
gathered in the same place.

162
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:50,515
The screening process
has already begun.

163
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,215
Of course you
didn't even notice.

164
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:55,415
Members of the
selection committee were
evaluating us at the camp.

165
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:56,848
Oh, yeah!

166
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,348
Those guys that were
wearing the suits...

167
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,415
You see, the goal of this
training camp

168
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,415
wasn't just the means
to weed people out...

169
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,881
The intention was to determine
which students were fit
to move up the ranks.

170
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,181
A festival of fine cuisine, huh?

171
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:10,615
That sounds like
it could be fun!

172
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:12,515
Now I could really get
behind something like that.

173
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:16,615
There is no way they'll ever
choose you for something
as elite as this!

174
00:10:16,715 --> 00:10:18,515
What's your deal anyway?

175
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:19,915
And the things you say...

176
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:22,781
I gained the experience that
comes from messing up.

177
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,481
You think you're gaining
experience from "messing up"?

178
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,415
You're simply making
excuses for yourself!

179
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:31,515
For a chef, failure
is unacceptable!

180
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,348
I don't know...

181
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:34,648
I do know!

182
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,315
Only the most exceptional dishes

183
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,881
should grace the dining table
of culinary establishments...

184
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,615
It is the essence
of haute cuisine!

185
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:47,715
There's one chef who knows...

186
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,648
Huh? What was that?

187
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,281
Don't worry about it.

188
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,615
So, uh, hey, Erina...

189
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:55,248
what was your excuse
for missing the bus?

190
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:57,981
Keep your nose out of my
business thank you very much.

191
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,648
Okay...

192
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,215
<i>This is, uh...</i>

193
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,915
<i>pretty awkward.</i>

194
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:11,981
<i>Maybe I'll just sleep.</i>

195
00:11:12,081 --> 00:11:14,015
(Snoring)

196
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:27,148
There it is!

197
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:28,981
Oh thank goodness.

198
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:50,748
<i>Well, well, well...</i>

199
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:56,648
So, Joichiro...
Soma Yukihira is your son.

200
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,481
[FUMIO]
Back and forth, back and forth.

201
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:06,815
Cleany clean!

202
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:09,315
Spick and span,
squeaky clean!

203
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:10,815
Doo dee doo...

204
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:13,081
Woo! That training camp
should be over soon.

205
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,515
Things should perk up
around here again.

206
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:17,081
(Doorbell)

207
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:22,915
You kids certainly got back
faster than I thought...
you... would.

208
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:25,648
Well, honestly.

209
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,348
If you're going to show up...

210
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:30,781
you could've at least
called before gracing
me with your presence.

211
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,248
Still no common sense, eh, boy?

212
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:36,115
Well, I found myself
in the area...

213
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,515
I'm back.

214
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:43,148
[JOICHIRO]
Heh heh, heh heh, heh heh heh!

215
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:49,315
[SOMA]
Hey, we're back!

216
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:50,348
[AOKI]
We're back!

217
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:51,681
(Laughter)

218
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:53,481
[ISSHIKI]
Soma, did you really
come back

219
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:54,715
in one of those
hotel limos?

220
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,515
[YUKI]
Woo! Must be nice!

221
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:57,781
You're a VIP!

222
00:12:57,881 --> 00:12:59,748
[SOMA]
Nah, c'mon, that's not true.

223
00:12:59,848 --> 00:13:01,581
Anyway, for what it's worth,

224
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,715
I'm glad you all made it
back in one piece.

225
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,881
I'm sure that you
are all exhausted.

226
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:09,215
So for tonight, you are all
going to be treated to a feast.

227
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:10,915
(Cheers)

228
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,181
Bring it on!

229
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:14,181
Yeah it's been awhile since
you've cooked for us.

230
00:13:14,281 --> 00:13:16,948
Simmer down. I'm not the one
who'll be cooking for you.

231
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:18,681
Huh?

232
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,548
Hey, Soma. Welcome back.

233
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:22,915
Come lend me a hand.

234
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:23,881
Sure.

235
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,181
Handle the mise en place,
would you?

236
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:27,481
I've already made the stock.

237
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,581
Mm‐hm, right,
you got it.

238
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,381
Wait a minute! You can't just
show up all of a sudden

239
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,648
like it's no big deal!

240
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,215
What are you even doing here?!

241
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,015
How do you two
know each other?

242
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,081
Uh, who is he?

243
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:42,481
He's an academy graduate. And
a former resident of Kyokusei

244
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,515
A graduate of Tohtsuki?!

245
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,215
Well, quite the generation
gap we have here.

246
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:51,881
Former No. 2 Seat on The Ten...
I give you Joichiro Saiba.

247
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:54,515
Former No. 2 seat on the Ten?!

248
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:55,881
"Saiba"?

249
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:58,981
Ah, the rice looks to be
just about ready, Soma.

250
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,315
Who cares about the rice?! Just
tell me what's going on, Dad!

251
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,115
They're father and son?!

252
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,881
Ahh, that makes sense!

253
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,548
[SOMA]
My dad's a Tohtsuki graduate...

254
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:10,948
He lived at Kyokusei...

255
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:14,181
And he was on the Ten... Heh!

256
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:18,315
This seems to be harder than
I thought to try and process.

257
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:19,781
It's a lot to take in.

258
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,481
Whoa! Soma's
actually flustered!

259
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:25,215
[RYOKO]
He's Soma's father, all right...

260
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:26,515
there's no doubt about that.

261
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,181
So lemme get this straight.

262
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:29,615
You're Joichiro Saiba?

263
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,081
Hey. You know of me, do ya?

264
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:34,848
Of course. I've seen your
name mentioned a few times

265
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:37,448
throughout some old
documents I've read.

266
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:39,515
You're the "Wandering Chef,"

267
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,348
who's traveled far‐and‐wide
and proven himself at famous
restaurants across the globe.

268
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:48,281
But one day, you
suddenly disappeared
from the culinary world.

269
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:51,548
To those in the know,
you're a legend.

270
00:14:51,648 --> 00:14:54,381
And my name is
Satoshi Isshiki.

271
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,548
I am the current No. 7 seat.

272
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,848
It's an honor to meet
the great Joichiro Saiba.

273
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:02,615
Eheh... I go by the name
"Yukihira" nowadays.

274
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,681
Or you can just
call me "Joichiro."

275
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:08,215
Uh, he hasn't even
batted an eye at how
Isshiki is dressed!

276
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:10,281
That's a former
member for you.

277
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:11,881
I'm not sure that's
the issue here.

278
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,948
I can't believe my dad's really
that famous around here.

279
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,248
How could you possibly
not know any of this?!

280
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:18,848
Well I only
recently found out

281
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:21,315
that he would pick up
work overseas every
now and then.

282
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:22,748
[PHONE]
<i>Blah blah blah...</i>

283
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,248
For some reason,
he'd get phone calls

284
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:26,081
in a language I
didn't understand.

285
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:30,648
And there were a lot
of photos of foreigners
hanging out with my dad.

286
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:34,448
But come on, isn't
that sort of thing pretty
commonplace in every household?

287
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,148
Not commonplace
anywhere!

288
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:40,981
<i>To think, Soma's father is</i>
<i>someone so famous...</i>

289
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:42,348
All right!

290
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:43,515
Shall we make a toast?!

291
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,881
(All agree and cheer)

292
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:46,581
[FUMIO]
To everyone who's
made it through

293
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:47,848
the training camp
from hell!

294
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,415
Today you will eat
and drink your fill!

295
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,281
Thank you so much for the food!

296
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:54,448
Cheers, everyone!

297
00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:57,348
A meal made by a
former seat of The Ten!

298
00:15:57,448 --> 00:15:59,181
Can't wait to
see how it tastes!

299
00:15:59,281 --> 00:16:02,015
<i>It makes me kinda nervous!</i>

300
00:16:02,115 --> 00:16:04,248
(Fluttered breath)

301
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:06,948
Here you are. Enjoy the food.

302
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:09,181
O... kay...

303
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,948
<i>It's a beautiful landscape...</i>

304
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,448
<i>I've never been to a</i>
<i>place like that before!</i>

305
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,981
<i>It's like a whole new world!</i>

306
00:16:26,081 --> 00:16:28,481
[ALL]
<i>This flavor is so...</i>

307
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:31,081
<i>ARABIAN!</i>

308
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,948
[AOKI and SATO]
This is super delish!

309
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,581
May I ask about the paste
you put on this lamb?

310
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,248
What is it?

311
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,648
[JOICHIRO]
That's harissa.

312
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:43,981
It's an all‐purpose
condiment from North Africa

313
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,081
made from hot peppers
and other ingredients.

314
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:49,715
I also took a page
from traditional
Middle Eastern cooking

315
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:52,381
and added parsley
and garam masala.

316
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,781
Haahhh!

317
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:56,915
So, um, Mister Joichiro,
what is this dish called?

318
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,848
[JOICHIRO]
That's zuppa di pesce.

319
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:02,648
It's a Ligurian‐style seafood
soup that uses stockfish.

320
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:04,815
Mister Joichiro!
What is this?

321
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:06,748
And, uh, tell me about this!

322
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:08,915
Oh that's a good one.

323
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,215
Mister Joichiro...

324
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:12,815
seems like one of those real
men you hear rumors about!

325
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,548
Yes. He is so
grown‐up and handsome.

326
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,781
Can't you kinda see
that in his son too?

327
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:19,581
You think,
in the future...

328
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:21,981
Soma could end up like that?

329
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,915
(Fawn)

330
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:24,915
Wha?

331
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:26,281
<i>What the heck?</i>

332
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:28,248
<i>They were all so down‐trodden,</i>

333
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:31,448
<i>but the second they tasted his</i>
<i>food, their hearts were warmed.</i>

334
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:36,848
<i>This cooking just</i>
<i>brims with the personality</i>
<i>of the man who made it!</i>

335
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:40,081
Woohoo! This is so good,
I can't stand it!

336
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,081
Oh man! Everything is
like the best thing ever!

337
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:44,181
What about this one here?

338
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,648
Haha...

339
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:48,248
<i>GOD!</i>

340
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,681
[JOICHIRO]
Oh, that?

341
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:52,248
I tried replicating a snake
dish I ate last month.

342
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,048
Yeah, it's disgusting.

343
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,881
You chop it up with
the skin still on,

344
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,715
then boil it without
prepping it at all.

345
00:17:59,848 --> 00:18:01,948
This is some seriously
heinous food.

346
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:05,448
Oh yeah? You think
it's horrible enough
to get into my Best Ten?

347
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,315
Maybe up to No. 4?
[SHUN]
If it's horrible, shouldn't
it be the "Worst Ten"?

348
00:18:08,415 --> 00:18:11,015
I think it could even be No. 2!
[YUKI] Yeah, they're father
and son, all right.

349
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,181
Nah, No. 2 is gonna
be hard to beat.

350
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,481
Joichiro...

351
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:15,715
you loved your bizarre
and unsightly foods...

352
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,281
and you always did.

353
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:18,381
Hm?

354
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,581
You were the man
they once called

355
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,681
"Carnage," after all.

356
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,315
[FUMIO]
But now... You seem to
have become quite adept

357
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:26,215
at making considerate dishes.

358
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,781
Huh?

359
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:29,781
[FUMIO]
You should let Gin
taste this sometime.

360
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,415
[JOICHIRO]
Yeah, you're right.

361
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:33,281
Gin? Wait a sec, don't tell me!

362
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:36,648
Yes. I'm sure he put on lots
of airs at the training camp.

363
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,181
Executive Chef of
Tohtsuki Resort, Gin Dojima.

364
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,048
[FUMIO]
So. This one is Gin.

365
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,681
And this is Joichiro.

366
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:50,281
Back when they were sophomores
in the high school division.

367
00:18:50,381 --> 00:18:51,448
(Girls fawn)

368
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,215
They're both so young cute!

369
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,281
Come on, Ma, you don't
need to keep showing
them stuff like that.

370
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,881
Oh, what's the harm in it?

371
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:02,548
So Chef Dojima was a resident
of Kyokusei Dorm, too?

372
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:03,681
Seriously?

373
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,748
Gin was the No. 1 seat
on the Ten.

374
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,015
And Joichiro was the No. 2 seat.

375
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:12,415
Back then those two ushered
in the golden age of Kyokusei

376
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,681
as I came to know and love it.

377
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:17,048
They won countless Food Wars,

378
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:19,915
snatching up land and
expanding the dorm's grounds,

379
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,315
contributing funds to improve
the dorm's kitchen,

380
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:24,748
and even securing supply routes.

381
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:28,015
They paid for it with what
they'd won through their own
strengths.

382
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:32,148
[JOICHIRO]
We were getting to where
we could practically
form our own country!

383
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:36,081
[FUMIO]
That field you all plowed,

384
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,848
your dedicated malted rice area,
and even the chicken coop...

385
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:44,981
Gin and Joichiro had a direct
hand in the bringing of ALL of
that to the Kyokusei dorm.

386
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:47,181
And every year...

387
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:51,048
Gin never fails to send
me a New Year's card or
some sort of gift.

388
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,815
(Clears throat)
SOME people don't
even bother

389
00:19:53,915 --> 00:19:55,881
to send me a letter
once in a while.

390
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:59,581
Well that's the reason
why I come and visit
you sometimes, Ma.

391
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:01,281
[FUMIO]
Oh don't even!

392
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,481
You drop in unexpectedly and
leave whenever you feel like it.

393
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,081
(Joichiro laughs)

394
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,515
Truly, some legendary
Tohtsuki graduates.

395
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:11,848
Well, I never actually
graduated the Academy.

396
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:14,148
No way! How's that possible?

397
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,948
You were the No. 2 chair.

398
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,881
A lot can happen.

399
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,810
So did Gin seem like
he's doing well?

400
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,410
Huh? I guess.

401
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,243
Hey, Dad...

402
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,643
This place...

403
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,010
Kyokusei Dormitory...

404
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,243
What was it like
for you living here?

405
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:49,543
Hmph! I had a blast.

406
00:20:49,643 --> 00:20:54,077
Everyone brushing up
on their cooking skills,
in whatever way they liked...

407
00:21:12,277 --> 00:21:13,143
Hey, Dad...

408
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,743
You wanna crash
in my room tonight?

409
00:21:14,843 --> 00:21:17,177
Yeah, well...

410
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,910
Huh?

411
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,610
Ha! Soma, you're in Room 303?

412
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,010
Huh? Yeah, that's right.

413
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,343
Right in the middle
of that room...

414
00:21:27,443 --> 00:21:30,843
there's a stain from
a spilt pot of stew...

415
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:33,077
I was cooking up
there one night.

416
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:37,277
[JOICHIRO]
Hey, Ma! Let me
borrow an empty room!

417
00:21:37,377 --> 00:21:39,043
[FUMIO]
Okay!

418
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,243
<i>My dad was here...</i>

419
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,377
<i>in this room?</i>

420
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:08,643
<i>Joichiro Saiba, huh?</i>

421
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:11,377
<i>Really?</i>

422
00:22:11,477 --> 00:22:13,443
<i>just when you think</i>
<i>you know someone.</i>

423
00:22:13,543 --> 00:22:19,277
<i>You find out... there's</i>
<i>so much more to them.</i>

424
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,910
[JOICHIRO]
<i>Soma! Soma!</i>

425
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,843
<i>You up?</i>

426
00:23:56,943 --> 00:23:57,910
Yeah.

427
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,777
<i>I'm in the kitchen right now.</i>

428
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:02,310
<i>Come on down here,</i>
<i>and bring your knife.</i>

429
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,743
(Groan)

430
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,677
Guess I'm helping
with breakfast, huh?

431
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:09,177
[SOMA]
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

432
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:11,610
<i>why did my dad even come</i>
<i>back to Japan?</i>

433
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,443
<i>Was it for a job</i>
<i>or something?</i>

434
00:24:14,543 --> 00:24:16,077
Hey! There he is!

435
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:18,043
Have you kept your
knife good'n sharp?

436
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:21,677
Of course. Yesterday,
to get rid of the smell
of the sharpening stone, I‐

437
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:22,877
Okay, fine.

438
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:24,543
Sorry to throw you right
into this

439
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:27,343
without warning, but I wanna
see how far you've come along.

440
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:29,810
Or how far you may
have fallen behind.

441
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,843
Show me right here and now.

442
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:36,610
I'd say it's been too
long since we've had a
proper food battle...

443
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,143
Now show me.

444
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,610
[JOICHIRO]
Next time on Food Wars,

445
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,977
it's the sixteenth course.

446
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,610
Sorry for the wait.

447
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,877
"The Cook Who Traveled
Thousands of Miles"

448
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:02,010
Please enjoy.

449
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,710
Nuts to you...
Nuts to you...
Nuts to you!

450
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,310
NUTS NUTS NUTS NUTS NUTS!
