1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,933
[YOUNG SOMA] Hey Pops!
One day... I'll be a master chef
and beat you!

2
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:09,700
[JOICHIRO] Really? You don't
say.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,066
Well good luck with all that.

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,866
[YOUNG SOMA] 'kay! Let's do it!

5
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,400
It's a food battle!

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,233
[JOICHIRO] It's been 490 battles
since then, huh.

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,800
[JOICHIRO] Listen up, Soma:

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,033
Don't go losing to anyone,
until you've lost to me again.

9
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:31,566
&lt;gulp&gt;

10
00:00:31,666 --> 00:00:34,166
&lt;attack&gt;

11
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:38,733
[JOICHIRO] Oh dear god.
Mine is way more foul and
offensive than yours, my boy!

12
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:16,020
[URARA] Megumi Tadokoro has 88
points.

13
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,153
That's 4th place.

14
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:18,887
She's headed to the finals!

15
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:20,153
&lt;cheer/roar&gt;

16
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:23,653
[URARA] In 3rd place with
90 points is Takumi Aldini.

17
00:02:23,753 --> 00:02:25,520
[URARA] Ranking in at 2nd place

18
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,853
with 92 points is Hisako Arato.

19
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:32,187
[URARA] And in 1st place with 95
points is Alice Nakiri.

20
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,487
[URARA] Congratulations!

21
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,787
You are the chosen candidates
from B Block!

22
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:39,553
[URARA] Now then, how is A Block
doing?

23
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,487
&lt;milling around,
surprised/concerned&gt;

24
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,553
[SOMA] The aroma...

25
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,487
It's like an explosion!

26
00:02:52,587 --> 00:02:54,587
[SOMA] This... is Akira's curry!

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,087
[BOTH] Hohhhhhh!!!!!!!

28
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:58,453
&lt;OM gasp&gt;

29
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,253
[SCHOOLBOY A] The aroma
is coming off so strong!

30
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,620
[SCHOOLGIRL A]
It's even reaching up here in
the rafters!

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,053
[AOKI]
My nostrils sting so bad

32
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,520
it's like they're bein' stabbed
with aroma knives!

33
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,987
[SATO] It's so pungent it's
seeping into my brain!

34
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,553
[MINATOZAKA] Beneath the lid is
a sublime curry

35
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:13,053
infused with an incredible
amount

36
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:14,753
of the fish collar's umami!

37
00:03:14,853 --> 00:03:16,787
[SCHOOLGIRL B] Oh wow, it smells
so good!

38
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:18,987
[SCHOOLBOY B] Amazing! Man, I
wanna eat that!

39
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:20,087
[JUN] Go, Akira!

40
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,287
&lt;CM nervous sounds, gulp&gt;

41
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:24,053
[MINATOZAKA] I'm gonna have to
dunk this naan

42
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:25,620
into the curry and gobble it up.

43
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,087
[MINATOZAKA] HrRrrrrrrr!!! I
have no words!

44
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
[ZENJI] This is known as pie
crust soup...

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,320
It follows the method of Paul
Bocuse,

46
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,087
leading chef in French cuisine.

47
00:03:38,187 --> 00:03:39,587
It's said to be inspired by the

48
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,520
lidded bowl of Japanese Kaiseki
cuisine.

49
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,187
[SHUN] The scent of the
ingredients

50
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,120
are concentrated when covered.

51
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,520
When the lid is removed...

52
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,553
a burst of aromatics is released
into the air..

53
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:53,253
[IKUMI] Fragrances are Akira
secret weapons.

54
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:54,620
He's used their unbridled power

55
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,020
to launch a direct attack on the
judges!

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,320
[KODA] The spices are: fennel
and lemongrass...

57
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,720
and cinnamon too.

58
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,987
But there's more in there...

59
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,820
There's something
tying them all together.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,120
What is it? What is the source
of this powerful aroma?

61
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:10,287
[NATSUME] It's holy basil!

62
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:13,553
And he's using it while it's
still fresh!

63
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,587
[SOMA] "Holy basil"?

64
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,987
[MINATOZAKA] This herb is deeply
regarded as Holy

65
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,387
in areas of Southern Asia.

66
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,253
If you smell it, a sensation of
sweetness

67
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:22,720
will surge through your body.

68
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,153
[KODA] In the traditional Indian
medicine

69
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:27,653
known as Ayurveda...

70
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:29,120
it's considered an enigmatic
miracle cure

71
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,687
for whatever illness you may
be carrying at the time.

72
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,687
[NATSUME] How did he get a‐hold
of this?

73
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:34,720
Fresh high‐quality holy basil is
rare.

74
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,353
and it's hard to find it here in
Japan.

75
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:39,387
[AKIRA] Yes. Those in the Shiomi
Seminars

76
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,253
have spent the last year growing
it.

77
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,787
[NATSUME] EhEhhhh!

78
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,287
[AKIRA] Our cultivation
method... is a trade secret.

79
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:48,020
[NATSUME] Professor Jun Shiomi,

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,187
a leading authority on spices.

81
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,387
[JUN] Wha‐wha‐wha?

82
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,353
[SOMA] True enough, it has a
powerful aroma

83
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,187
that's very... intoxicating.

84
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:57,487
But that's not all he's done.

85
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,653
There's something that makes you

86
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,320
wanna eat more and more...

87
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,653
[SOMA] Is that yogurt?

88
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:03,887
[AKIRA] You are correct... Soma.

89
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:06,487
[AKIRA] Y'see. One mistake with
holy basil

90
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:09,620
and it overpowers everything
else in your dish.

91
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,253
Yogurt can help mellow the
flavor

92
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,020
and blend it with the rest.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,187
[CHAPELLE] What's more...

94
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,553
Curcumin is also good for
digestion.

95
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,687
And it has the ability to remove
toxins from the liver.

96
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,753
But when it's ingested with
yogurt ‐

97
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,520
it has the ability to produce

98
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,920
even greater effects for one's
overall well being.

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,587
[JUN] He even considered the
health benefits!

100
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:30,920
Do it, Akira! Use that big brain
of yours!

101
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,820
[NATSUME] To think, there's a
chef in this country

102
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,453
who can properly use holy
basil...

103
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,953
[NATSUME] Akira Hayama!

104
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:40,253
[NATSUME] Won't you be mine?

105
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,853
You're too delicious to be true.

106
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:42,987
&lt;react&gt;

107
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,153
[NATSUME] Just think a moment

108
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:45,253
and name your asking price.

109
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:46,720
100 million?

110
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,787
200?

111
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:50,153
I'll pay however much you
require of‐ Uh?!

112
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:51,653
[AKIRA] No thank you...

113
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:52,987
I fight for Jun Shiomi.

114
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,187
&lt;gasp&gt;

115
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,720
[JUN] Oh...?

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,687
[AKIRA] Appreciate the offer,
though.

117
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:01,287
[NATSUME] Hmmmm! Such a glorious
young man!

118
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:04,120
If I didn't want him already, I
want him now!

119
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:06,720
[MINATOZAKA] Mmmmm!!

120
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,887
Each bite sends a bolt of umami

121
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:08,687
straight to the brain!

122
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:10,253
Like laser beams of YUM‐YUM!

123
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,553
[KODA] I've never encountered

124
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,920
something so "sharp" yet so
delicious!

125
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,820
[NATSUME] This dish is perfect.

126
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,320
It has reached the pinnacle of
modern‐day curry.

127
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,353
[YUA] Um... so then, judges...

128
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:28,187
What is your final verdict? Your
scores, please.

129
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,653
[YUUKI] You guys!
[BOTH] Uhh?

130
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:31,487
So what was the final score?

131
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:32,887
[YUUKI] &lt;heaving for breath&gt;
We'll tell you later.

132
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:34,453
How are things here?

133
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:35,453
[TAKUMI] What about Soma?

134
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:37,487
What score did he get?!

135
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:39,320
[ISAMI] Calm down, Takumi.

136
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,820
Looks like he hasn't presented
yet.

137
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,687
[TAKUMI] &lt;growl&gt;

138
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,920
[YUA] Shun Hayama's score is...

139
00:06:47,187 --> 00:06:49,453
There we have it!

140
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:54,620
[YUA] 94 points, putting him
straight into 1st place!

141
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:58,753
[JUN] Way to go,
Akiraaaaaaaaa!!!

142
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,420
[RYO] 2nd place, huh?

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,787
I think the Mistress will
be upset with that.

144
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,753
Well, I'll just try to do better
in the finals.

145
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,287
[IKUMI] Ehh! Guess I'm out...

146
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,887
[KANICHI] MEAT MEAT!
You got robbed out there!

147
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,387
But it's okay!

148
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:17,387
[MEGUMI] Poor Ryoko

149
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:18,520
[SATO] Hey, look!

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,587
TWO judges gave him a perfect
20!

151
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:23,587
[AOKI] Akira Hayama is one
fearsome dude!

152
00:07:24,587 --> 00:07:25,787
[SATOSHI] A perfect 20, which

153
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,253
not even Alice Nakiri was able
to achieve...

154
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,553
That was a sight to see.

155
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:30,953
[ERINA] Oh uh Isshiki!

156
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:32,053
Why are you in here?

157
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,487
What about B Block's judging?

158
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:36,520
&lt;laugh&gt; I asked the others
to kindly clean up for me.

159
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,087
[FUMIO] My, that was a heck of a
battle over there.

160
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:42,020
[ERINA] Oh my God!
Unauthorized personnel
aren't allowed in here.

161
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,287
[FUMIO] There, there. I'm askin'
you as a dorm mother.

162
00:07:45,387 --> 00:07:46,587
[ERINA]
That is totally irrelevant!

163
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,987
[SATOSHI] You came to A‐Block

164
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:50,220
cause you were curious about
Soma too, weren't you?

165
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,653
[ERINA] ERK! That's ridiculous!

166
00:07:51,753 --> 00:07:54,253
[YUA] All right. Let's keep this
competition moving.

167
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:57,387
Soma Yukihira will present next.
[ERINA] Uh!

168
00:07:57,487 --> 00:07:59,553
[YUA] Please serve your dish.

169
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,987
[MEGUMI] Soma... What kind of
dish did you make?

170
00:08:03,087 --> 00:08:04,187
[SOMA] Here.

171
00:08:04,287 --> 00:08:06,453
For you, enjoy Akira.

172
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,620
[AKIRA] What's with that smug
face of yours?

173
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,753
[AKIRA] Barely a month ago,

174
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:14,420
this guy didn't even know about
karipatta, a basic spice.

175
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,753
So why is he now grinning after
having eaten my curry?

176
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:20,787
[SOMA] &lt;laugh&gt; Yeah.. I just
thought why not y'know.

177
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:24,053
And I went with whatever came to
mind.

178
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:25,653
[AKIRA] Wait this is...

179
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,053
an omelet!

180
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,320
[SCHOOLBOY C] Huh?

181
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,653
[SCHOOLBOY D] Didn't that
transfer student

182
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,387
make that at the training camp?

183
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:36,920
[SOMA] Order up.

184
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,220
Another aroma Bomb...

185
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,253
[ERINA] Uhnh!

186
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,120
[SOMA] Comin atcha!

187
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,120
[MINATOZAKA] Whoa! Inside of
that omelet is risotto!

188
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,653
[NATSUME] The aroma that had
been sealed inside...

189
00:08:50,753 --> 00:08:52,287
is exploding all over the place!

190
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:55,020
&lt;yells, screams&gt;

191
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,853
[SCHOOLBOY E] On the heels of
Akira's dish...

192
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,587
[SCHOOLBOY F] It's another huge
explosion of aroma!

193
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,053
[AKIRA] You came up with the
same idea.

194
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,953
[SOMA] Looks to be that way,
huh?

195
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,720
So far, at least.

196
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:09,653
[SOMA] It's hot, so watch
yourself.

197
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:11,387
[SOMA] May I present...

198
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:13,420
Yukihira curry risotto rice
omelet!

199
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,653
[IKUMI] The risotto he's stuffed
in the middle

200
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,287
is bright and sweetly
glistening!

201
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:18,620
The filling is like a rice bowl

202
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
coated with top‐quality sauce.

203
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,787
[RYOKO] &lt;hand love&gt;Incredible!

204
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,753
Such a full‐bodied, mellow
aroma!

205
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:26,887
Makes you smile without even
realizing it.

206
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:30,153
[KODA] My anticipation is right
up there with Akira's curry.

207
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:31,553
Here we go...

208
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:33,720
&lt;blow/inhale/blow&gt;

209
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,520
[NATSUME]

210
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,153
[STUDENTS] &lt;ohhs and whoaahs&gt;

211
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,620
[MINATOZAKA] Hmmm...

212
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,620
&lt;gulp&gt;

213
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,520
&lt;raging blowed&gt;

214
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,453
[MINATOZAKA] So powerful!

215
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:48,220
[KODA] It's a raging blow of
flavor!

216
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,087
[IKUMI] &lt;CT&gt; Yes!

217
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:50,753
[MEGUMI] HaAhhhhhh!

218
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,187
d[KODA] He made a rich bouillon

219
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,853
using chicken carcass and beef
tendon...

220
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,720
The flavor of onions and ground
beef

221
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,520
pan‐fried in butter extends to
the rice itself.

222
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,387
[MINATOZAKA] The creaminess of
the risotto

223
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,553
and the soft‐cooked fried egg

224
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:02,820
form the perfect combination.

225
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Ahhh!!!I feel like I'm about to
collapse!

226
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,487
[NATSUME] This sauce delivers
the finishing gut punch.

227
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,253
It uses oyster sauce as a base,

228
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,087
with an accent of pure honey.

229
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:15,087
It's rich, but with a mellow
acidity that comes through.

230
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:16,687
Through the sauce and the
risotto,

231
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:19,353
he was able to create two layers
of flavor!

232
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,520
[KODA] Just amazing.

233
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,087
The impact of Akira's curry

234
00:10:22,187 --> 00:10:23,620
came from its lack of pungency.

235
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,420
But this is like a secondary
explosion of aroma!

236
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,487
The inner and outer smells
intermingle in waves,

237
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,420
tantalizing the diner!

238
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,287
[AKIRA] But there's more to this
depth of flavor...

239
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,053
It's savory with a hint of
bitterness.

240
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:38,753
Cumin and cardamom...

241
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:41,920
And clove to stimulate the
tongue...

242
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,753
[AKIRA] I can make out bits and
pieces of it,

243
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:46,053
but those are only the surface
flavors.

244
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:50,153
What is this richness that has
bound with the spices?

245
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,287
I've got it!

246
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:52,853
[AKIRA] Mango!

247
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:53,787
Mango chutney.

248
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:55,820
[NATSUME] Mango chutney, you
say?!

249
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,553
That's enough to create such
levels of alluring flavor?

250
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:01,753
[ISAMI] Mango Chutney, is that
paste‐like stuff.

251
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:02,320
Am I right?

252
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,353
[TAKUMI] Yeah.

253
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:04,420
You grind up and simmer spices

254
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,587
and other fruits and vegetables.

255
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:08,153
Then you turn it into a
condiment.

256
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,153
[JUN] Different parts of Asia,
have created combinations,

257
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,720
in a wide variety of styles,

258
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,587
using either sweet or spicy, or
adding in herbs like mint.

259
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:17,620
[SOMA] This mango chutney

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,087
is my own homemade blend.

261
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:22,453
All I did was add this to the
rice and let it simmer.

262
00:11:22,553 --> 00:11:24,687
[SOMA] I used mango as the focal
point,

263
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:27,153
to bind the flavors of the other
spices

264
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,953
and give the dish that much more
depth.

265
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,720
[SOMA] Put simply, "applied
spice techniques."

266
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,620
[ZENJI] In India, which is its
country of origin...

267
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,920
Chutney is simply a garnish.

268
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,653
It's also considered medicinal
in some parts.

269
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:41,920
This is the Japanese method.

270
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,620
[IKUMI] Huh...

271
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,753
[RYOKO] I had no idea.

272
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:45,287
[CHAPELLE] This is a most
unusual

273
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:47,620
cooking method for its place of
origin.

274
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,820
But having said that...

275
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,487
[KODA] This dish would be
difficult

276
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,553
to add any more fats or animal
products to it...

277
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:55,620
[MINATOZAKA] It's added a
dramatic dimension of flavor!

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,020
[ERINA] Soma Yukihira...

279
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,053
[ERINA] His prior use of eggs
was a disaster. Uh.

280
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,320
[SATOSHI] At the training camp,

281
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,620
his omelets almost caused him to
flunk out.

282
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,587
Then, his risotto battle against
his father was a failure.

283
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:07,887
[SATOSHI] He brought in the
combined

284
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:09,920
techniques of those two
experiences.

285
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,920
[ERINA] His father?

286
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,520
[SATOSHI] Through all his
failures...

287
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,987
zero against 490 wins...

288
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,253
he hasn't let a single lesson go
by the wayside.

289
00:12:18,353 --> 00:12:20,687
[FUMIO] Heh.... Come to think of
it, he's a good listener.

290
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:22,853
That could be taken as hard
persistence.

291
00:12:22,953 --> 00:12:26,253
If he loses, he's not willing to
let that be.

292
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,420
That darn Soma...
He puts on a cool face,

293
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,987
but he hates losing
more than anything.

294
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,353
[ERINA] UhUhhh...

295
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:34,587
[SOMA] But hey... I gained the
experience

296
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,587
that comes from messing up.

297
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,153
[ERINA] That's simply making
excuses for yourself!

298
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:41,953
For a chef, failure is
unacceptable!

299
00:12:42,453 --> 00:12:44,387
&lt;react&gt;

300
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,487
[MINATOZAKA] It's delicious
through and through,
the result of some hard work.

301
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:50,287
What's more, the aftertaste
is so crisp and clean!

302
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:51,787
That must be thanks to the
chutney.

303
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:53,553
[NATSUME] Still, Akira's pie
dish

304
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,120
had a more luxurious aroma.

305
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,387
[JUDGE B] Yes, However...

306
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:58,353
When the sauce and the rice come
together

307
00:12:58,453 --> 00:12:59,787
the resulting depth is profound!

308
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:02,820
[KODA] Akira's curry revolved
around holy basil,

309
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,353
likening it to a spear piercing
through your very soul.

310
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:07,553
This curry attacks in waves...

311
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,953
In successive assaults on your
taste‐buds!

312
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,587
[CHAPELLE] They both have
their own scented weapons,

313
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:12,520
different styles they're using
in all‐out warfare!

314
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,253
[SOMA] &lt;growls&gt;

315
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,087
[AKIRA] &lt;snarls&gt;

316
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,020
[JUN] Ahhhhh!!!

317
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,920
[AKIRA] &lt;thrust effort&gt;

318
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,120
[SOMA] Hyehh! HYAHHH!

319
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:21,153
[SOMA] Ehhh! AH!

320
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,287
[AKIRA] Hahhhhhhhh!!! Huh?

321
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,587
[BOTH] Hyeehhhhh!!!

322
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,720
[CHAPELLE] This is a fight
between two warriors

323
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,353
aiming for the top spot at
Totsuki!

324
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:32,487
&lt;whoaas and ohhs&gt;

325
00:13:32,587 --> 00:13:33,620
[SCHOOLBOY F]
Whoa. Look at that.

326
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
They're givin' him
great reviews!

327
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,020
[SCHOOLBOY E] Don't tell me that

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,820
transfer student's gonna beat
Akira Hayama!

329
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,487
[YUA] Well then, judges...if
you're ready...

330
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,653
please mark your final scores

331
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,087
[YUA] 18!

332
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,820
19!

333
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,953
18!

334
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:08,953
19!

335
00:14:09,053 --> 00:14:10,353
19!

336
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:11,953
[YUA] For a total of...

337
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,187
[YUA] 93 points!

338
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,387
[YUA] Soma ties for second
place!

339
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,487
And that is your final tally!

340
00:14:18,587 --> 00:14:20,153
[YUUKI] What?! Come on!

341
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:21,420
[MEGUMI] One point off?

342
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,153
[ISAMI] He got 93 points!

343
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,753
[TAKUMI] Oh my God.

344
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:26,987
[ZENJI] 2nd place?

345
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,920
[RYO] We're tied...

346
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,520
It's you and me... Soma.

347
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:34,220
[ALICE] &lt;giggle&gt;

348
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,153
[SCHOOLBOY B] Good, that
transfer student

349
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:37,553
wasn't able to take the top
spot.

350
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:40,753
[SCHOOLBOY H] Akira's like the
essence of curry.

351
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:41,753
[AKIRA] &lt;react&gt;

352
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:42,587
[RYOKO] Wait...

353
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,353
Take a look at those scores!

354
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:46,420
[IKUMI] Out of the five
judges...

355
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,387
three of them preferred Soma's
dish to Akira's.

356
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:51,120
[IKUMI] And that means...

357
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,353
If they were to fight... under
Food War regulations...

358
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,220
[MINATOZAKA] What is wrong with
you!?

359
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,487
How can you not understand

360
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:59,387
the remarkable work of art that
curry was?

361
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,720
He had the skills to put Holy
basil in a dish!

362
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,020
[KODA] Nonsense.
If you recall the theme is curry
cuisine.

363
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,020
We are not here to judge
simply on their choice of
spices.

364
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,620
It's important to feel satisfied
by a single plate.

365
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,753
[NATSUME] Unless you are dead,

366
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:13,153
Akira won on that point as well!

367
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,587
[JUDGE A] But it was
Young Soma's dish

368
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,287
that made me want to eat it over
and over again.

369
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:18,020
[MINATOZAKA] Oh shut up, you
minor character! [JUDGES]
ERK!

370
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,987
[KODA] Don't let your emotions
cloud your opinion!

371
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,687
[MINATOZAKA] Anyone who lacks a
diverse frame

372
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,553
of reference has no business
talking about fine dining!

373
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,220
[KODA] You have no business
being a judge!

374
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,287
[MINATOZAKA]
Oh shut your fat mustache!

375
00:15:26,387 --> 00:15:27,587
[YUA] Stop it please!

376
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,253
Everyone just needs to
settle down and relax!

377
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,587
[KODA] Why don't you go back
to your computer where you
belong!?

378
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:33,087
[MINATOZAKA] What was that, you
go to hell!

379
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:34,687
[IKUMI] Why are they
still arguing?

380
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:38,220
I mean isn't Akira still
in 1st place?
[RYOKO] I think so.

381
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,653
[EIZAN] Well at least
he made it this far.

382
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,853
I look forward to the finals...

383
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:44,753
Soma Yukihira.

384
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,953
[JUN] Oh, Akira! You were
amazing out there!
You're incredible!

385
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,420
[CHAPELLE] There are but two
outcomes at the finals:

386
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,420
win or lose. Hmmm...

387
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,287
[CHAPELLE] If those two are to
be

388
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,353
pitted against one another...

389
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,120
Which one of them will end up
coming out on top?

390
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,753
&lt;laughter&gt;

391
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:13,153
[SENZAEMON] And so the 92nd
era...

392
00:16:13,253 --> 00:16:15,387
The Golden Age, eh?

393
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:20,787
&lt;big evil laugh&gt;

394
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,420
[YUUKI] Gather 'round folks...

395
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,920
To the Fall Selection's
theatrics!

396
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,920
To its crazy conclusion,

397
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,253
we celebrate the results

398
00:16:31,353 --> 00:16:34,720
AND all our hard work. Let's
partay!

399
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,153
[ALL] Cheers!

400
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,053
[ALL]

401
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,987
ME‐GU‐MI!

402
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:43,820
ME‐GU‐MI! ME‐GU‐MI!

403
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
ME‐GU‐MI!

404
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,287
[FISHERMAN A] That was some
mighty fine cooking, Megumi!

405
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:49,953
[FISHERMAN C] At this rate,
you might win this whole food
competition!

406
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:52,387
[MEGUMI] Huhh?! Wait, just calm
down you guys! [ALL] laughs

407
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,387
[MIYOKO] Megumi Tadokoro.

408
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:55,553
[MEGUMI] Huh? Hey Miyoko.

409
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:56,853
[MIYOKO] It kinda looks like...

410
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:59,187
I misunderstood the talent you
have.

411
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,320
Impressive. I'll be rooting for
you.

412
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,987
[MIYOKO] If you run into any
more trouble,

413
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:05,653
you just let me know.

414
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:07,987
[MEGUMI] Thank you very much,
Miyoko!

415
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,487
[YUUKI] I toldja! I knew how
truly awesome

416
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,053
you were this whole time,
Megumi.

417
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:15,253
[MEGUMI] Come on, Yuuki!

418
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:17,087
[YUUKI] Don't worry my talent
friend.

419
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm gonna have a whole squad

420
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,153
ready to cheer you on at the
finals!

421
00:17:20,253 --> 00:17:21,353
[MEGUMI] That would be great!

422
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,220
[FISHERMAN A] Come over here,
Megumi!

423
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,553
Let's get a picture with the
guys, okay?!

424
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,387
[YUUKI] They're calling for you.
Get over there girl.

425
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,420
[FUMIO] Well done Yuuki.

426
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,853
[YUUKI] Ms. Fumio you're just
the greatest!

427
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:33,987
Thank you for all your support
today!

428
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:35,820
Things are going to get really
busy 'round here.

429
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,620
I've gotta make a banner for
Megumi that screams awesomeness!

430
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,953
Ms. Fumio will you help me put
together some..

431
00:17:40,053 --> 00:17:41,553
[FUMIO] Tonight I'm treating

432
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:43,720
my sweet girl to
her favorite dish.

433
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,620
That was some good cooking.

434
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,020
You did all right out there.

435
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,587
&lt;sobs, crying&gt;

436
00:17:53,187 --> 00:17:54,620
&lt;sniffles&gt;

437
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,787
[IKUMI] That's some super
high‐quality duck you got there!

438
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,653
[YUUKI] You can tell
just by looking at it?

439
00:17:59,753 --> 00:18:01,020
That's a pretty neat trick.

440
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,353
[TAKUMI] Ah!

441
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:04,353
I didn't realize Koji can work
like that too?

442
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,787
[ISAMI] I had no idea you could
do that.

443
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,253
[RYOKO] Yeah well you just gotta
know when to use it.

444
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,720
[AOKI] Still, I never thought
Zenji

445
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,453
would have his own cheering
section!

446
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:14,420
[SATO] Yeah. That gives him a
whole new level of cool...

447
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,787
[ZENJI] And yet, once again

448
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:18,853
the party is being held
in MY freakin' bedroom.

449
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,787
[SATOSHI] You two, please make
sure that you eat your fill.

450
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:25,320
[TAKUMI] Uh, okay.
We're very grateful for the
invitation, Isshiki.

451
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,820
[IKUMI] We've got a guy waggling
around in nothing but an apron.

452
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,520
Why isn't anyone
talking about this?

453
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,853
[RYOKO] Say, where is Shun
hiding away tonight?

454
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,320
[YUUKI] Hmm? I bet he's holed up
in his room

455
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,920
feeling sorry for himself.

456
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,520
He may not let it show,

457
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,320
but I think he was pretty upset.

458
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,653
Jeez, I swear.

459
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,353
Maybe I should go drag him out
here.

460
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:47,287
[SATOSHI] It's two weeks
until the final tournament
is upon us.

461
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,587
This will be a battle between

462
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,653
the students currently
considered to be

463
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:53,687
the fiercest of Totsuki's
1st‐years!

464
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:55,753
[TAKUMI] Now listen to me, Soma!

465
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:57,920
If you go losing before you face
ME,

466
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,787
you're gonna pay!

467
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,620
Yeah yeah...
that's fine by me.

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,553
[SOME ]Bring it on!
[TAKUMI] Oh I'm bringin' it.

469
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:05,153
&lt;drunken laughter...
barely conscious moans&gt;

470
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:06,387
[AKIRA] Hey, Jun.

471
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,687
Getting drunk by yourself

472
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:10,787
and passing out is even more sad
than usual.

473
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:12,087
&lt;nasal exhale&gt;

474
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:13,387
[AKIRA] I guess it is
what it is.

475
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,987
[JUN] You know what Akira...?

476
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,653
You might just change the
culinary world forever.

477
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:19,920
&lt;Hmm&gt;

478
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,720
[AKIRA] &lt;Hmm&gt; Jun. I am going to
win the finals first.

479
00:19:24,753 --> 00:19:26,520
[AKIRA] You found a place for
me...

480
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,453
[AKIRA] I'm winning this for
you...

481
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,020
[ALICE] What the heck?

482
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,620
What's your deal, Erina?

483
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,487
Come on Gimme a break! Come out
with me tonight!

484
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:36,987
Your cousin just got through the
preliminaries

485
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,453
with the top score out of
everyone from both blocks!

486
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,620
[ALICE] You have a DUTY to
celebrate.

487
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,587
You think so too, don't you Ryo?

488
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:45,487
[RYO] I'm fine with whatever she
decides.

489
00:19:45,587 --> 00:19:47,687
[ALICE] Whuuuaaghhh!!! Dangit,
Ryo!

490
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,587
What's wrong with you!
You're supposed to be on my
side!

491
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:51,787
[RYO] Okay... really
sorry about that.

492
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:55,320
[ERINA] I'm afraid I have some
paperwork to take care of
tonight.

493
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,387
I'll have to celebrate with you
another time.

494
00:19:58,487 --> 00:19:59,587
[ALICE] Ooh?! If you say so.

495
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:01,453
I'll let you off the hook for
tonight.

496
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,320
I'll be back tomorrow.

497
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,153
Let's go, Ryo.
[ERINA]
[RYO] Sure.

498
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:08,853
[ERINA] Congrats on getting
through the prelims, Alice.

499
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:10,087
You too, Ryo.

500
00:20:10,187 --> 00:20:11,153
[RYO] Thank you.

501
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,653
[HISAKO] I'm sorry, Miss Erina.

502
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,187
I know you said you were very
busy tonight, but I tried.

503
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,420
[ERINA] It couldn't be helped.

504
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,953
It's Alice, after all.

505
00:20:18,053 --> 00:20:20,387
[ERINA] Congratulations to you,
too, Hisako. [HISAKO] Oh?

506
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:23,287
[ERINA] I thought it only
fitting that you would make it
through

507
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:26,887
but just the same it still makes
me very proud.

508
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:27,720
[HISAKO] Okay!

509
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,620
I'll work to get even better,

510
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,020
and I WILL win! Don't you worry!

511
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,687
[NAO] HeeHeeHeeHee!

512
00:20:33,787 --> 00:20:36,187
That's my "Big Sis" Miss Hisako!

513
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,020
Heeheeheehee!

514
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,453
ACK!

515
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,587
&lt;sigh&gt;

516
00:20:44,687 --> 00:20:48,187
[ERINA] The aroma that came from
that dish...

517
00:20:48,287 --> 00:20:49,720
[ERINA] That amazing... Aroma!

518
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,953
[ERINA] AhAhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!

519
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,387
&lt;OM inhale&gt;

520
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,320
[SOMA] How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

521
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,853
How ya like me now?
How ya like me now?

522
00:20:57,953 --> 00:21:01,353
[ERINA] Get away from me!
[SOMA] You wanna take a bite!

523
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,353
[SOMA]
You know you wanna try it!

524
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:03,487
You know you wanna try it!

525
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:06,387
You know you wanna try it!

526
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,687
[ERINA] It's disgusting!

527
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:11,753
[ERINA] Uhhnn!!! [ERINA]

528
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:17,053
[ERINA] Soma Yukihira...

529
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,220
[MEGUMI] Hey, Soma!

530
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,620
[SOMA] Hmm?

531
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,853
[SOMA] Oh uh hey there Megumi.
What's goin' on?

532
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:34,353
[MEGUMI] Um...

533
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:38,353
I thought you seemed a little
down.

534
00:21:38,453 --> 00:21:39,920
You want to talk about it?

535
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,453
[SOMA] I'm doing fine.
More importantly Megumi,

536
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:42,653
they say you used ingredients

537
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,287
from your hometown to make a
curry!

538
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,320
[MEGUMI] It's not a big deal.

539
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,887
[SOMA] That's totally amazing!

540
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:49,553
[MEGUMI] You know, it still
doesn't feel quite real to me...

541
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:52,320
Six months ago, they were gonna
kick me out.

542
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,553
[SOMA] Oh, yeah. Man,

543
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:55,787
that first lesson seems so long
ago.

544
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:58,520
That was the first time you and
I worked together, huh?

545
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,320
[MEGUMI] Everything... I've done
is thanks to you.

546
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,987
It's because of you I've been
able to come this far.
You are a good friend.

547
00:22:06,087 --> 00:22:09,720
[SOMA] Nah, you've always
had what it took right
from the start Megumi.

548
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,953
[SOMA] Your cooking really is
top notch.

549
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:14,553
[SOMA] It's like, it really
warms you up inside...

550
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,553
[SOMA] Kinda like love.

551
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:17,820
&lt;inhale, tittering&gt;

552
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
[SOMA] Ah!

553
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,120
[MEGUMI] EhHeeHee!
Thank you very much Soma.

554
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,420
That makes me really happy.

555
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,987
[IKUMI] What are those
two talking about

556
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,153
all alone out there?

557
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:28,253
And why am I creeping around

558
00:22:28,353 --> 00:22:29,453
in the shadows watching them?

559
00:22:29,553 --> 00:22:30,653
[YUUKI] Well, well.

560
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:31,487
Isn't this an
interesting development?

561
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:32,420
[IKUMI] Ohhhh?!

562
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,587
[RYOKO] It certainly is.

563
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,653
[MEGUMI] You really did great,
Soma.

564
00:22:36,753 --> 00:22:38,420
To be able to go toe‐to‐toe with
Akira...

565
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,620
I mean...he's the curry
specialist...

566
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:43,120
[SOMA] Hmmmm... He still managed
to get

567
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,553
a one‐point lead on me though.

568
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:46,887
I really went in there expecting
to win this thing.

569
00:22:46,987 --> 00:22:48,653
Honestly I wanted to get a
perfect score

570
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:50,387
from all five of the judges.

571
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:51,920
[MEGUMI] You were aiming high,
weren't you?

572
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,887
[SOMA] Akira used spices I'd
never even heard of

573
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,120
to make an unreal dish.

574
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,453
How is that even possible?

575
00:22:58,553 --> 00:22:59,653
[SOMA] There's so much more

576
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,053
I wanna learn about cooking.

577
00:23:01,153 --> 00:23:03,653
About different ingredients,
different methods...

578
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:06,253
I want to learn from people who
already know how.

579
00:23:06,353 --> 00:23:09,420
[SOMA] Then put all that into my
next dish.

580
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:13,420
[SOMA] I want... I need to get
stronger!

581
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:19,220
[YUUKI] Come on! It's time for
round two you guys!

582
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,753
[SATOSHI] I'm not done...not
yet.

583
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:23,187
This night is just getting
started!

584
00:23:23,287 --> 00:23:24,553
[IKUMI] &lt;scream!&gt;

585
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,120
[SATOSHI] It's Boomerang time!

586
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,320
[AOKI] Yeah... All right:

587
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,920
Isshiki's Third Form front and
center!

588
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,087
[SATO] That is one tiny little
speedo!

589
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,853
[FUMIO] &lt;hums the closing theme&gt;

590
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:37,920
[ZENJI] Come on, Shun! Get on
that bottle like you mean it!

591
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,487
You love rice juice!

592
00:23:39,587 --> 00:23:41,187
[SHUN] You're freaking me out
Zenji.

593
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:42,620
[TAKUMI] Okay Soma! Just you
wait

594
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,887
I will utterly annihilate you at
final competition.

595
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:47,687
[RYOKO] I think this guy might
have some problems.

596
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,153
[ISAMI] I usually just leave him
alone

597
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,453
whenever he gets all worked up
in a tizzy like this.

598
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:53,520
[YUUKI] You're his brother you
should take care of him!

599
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,987
[SATO] This meat is some top
quality stuff, bro!

600
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:57,053
Eat up!

601
00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:58,120
[AOKI] Don't mind if I do!

602
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,820
[IKUMI] Oh hell no! [BOTH] Huh?

603
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,653
[IKUMI] If you dunk that
delicious meat in that nasty
sauce...

604
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:04,553
you will massacre its delicate
natural flavors!

605
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,487
[IKUMI] You're spittin' directly
in that poor meat's face!

606
00:24:06,587 --> 00:24:08,887
I‐I'm sorry, Miss Meat Meat!
Have mercy!

607
00:24:08,987 --> 00:24:11,053
[MEAT MEAT] Don't call me "Meat
Meat," you piece of crap!

608
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:13,153
[MEAT MEAT] There is only one
person on this earth

609
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:14,753
who is allowed to say Meat Meat
to me.

610
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,353
[MEAT MEAT] Agh oh my god
now you've got me saying it,
too!

611
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:18,853
[AOKI] Whaaaauuughhhhh!!!!
Agggghhhh!

612
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:20,420
&lt;back breaking&gt;

613
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,387
[SOMA] All right now. We need
something

614
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:23,853
to liven things up around here.

615
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,787
[RYOKO] I think he's going make
something gross again!

616
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:27,620
[YUUKI] No, please don't do this
to us Soma?!

617
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,387
[MEGUMI] No, Soma.
You don't have to make
anything, it's okay!

618
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:33,320
[SOMA] Too late. It's already
made.

619
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,153
[SOMA] Time to eat up.

620
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:35,620
[MEGUMI] Ummph!

621
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
[SOMA] Octopus tentacles in
yogurt sauce.

622
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,887
[MEGUMI] NOOOOO!

623
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:42,653
It's horrible!!!!

624
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,753
[ALL] Thanks for the food!
