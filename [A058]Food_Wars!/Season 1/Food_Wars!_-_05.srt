00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:29,239
Allow me the indulgence
of re‐introducing myself:

00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,772
[ISSHIKI]
From the Tohtsuki Council
of Ten...

7
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:33,839
Uhh.

8
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,639
[ISSHIKI]
I am Chair No. 7...

00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:39,639
Satoshi Isshiki.

10
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,106
So, that means...

11
00:00:45,206 --> 00:00:47,572
you're on the council of Ten?

12
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,306
Now then...

13
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:52,506
I would like to try
YOUR food, next.

14
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:54,606
(Nervous inhale)

15
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:59,506
[ISSHIKI]
I'm curious as to
what you will prepare.

16
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:01,772
Come and show me...

17
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:04,672
how you express yourself...

18
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:07,172
through your cooking.

19
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:10,339
(Nervous exhale)

20
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,206

<i>I think I'm beginning</i>

21
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,539
<i>why my dad sent me here.</i>

22
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:16,739
Hmph!

23
00:01:17,806 --> 00:01:18,672
Huh?

24
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:20,439
(Swish)

25
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,872
Order up!

[SOMA]
<i>His dish. A peppered mackerel.</i>
<i>With a puree...</i>

30
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,206
So I'm guessing your
family's restaurant...

31
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:16,939
is in traditional
fine dining?

32
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,006
Interesting. Why would
you think that?

33
00:03:19,106 --> 00:03:22,839
Because peppered mackerel
is normally found on
that type of menu.

34
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,739
Plus, you can't learn to
prepare this kind of thing
at just any old restaurant.

35
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,139
(Laugh)

36
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:32,039
[SOMA]
<i>That mackerel, cooked up</i>
<i>flaky and delicate...</i>

37
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:36,072
<i>And the surprising choice</i>
<i>to make the spring cabbage</i>
<i>the base of the puree...</i>

38
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:42,639
<i>Still, the silky smoothness</i>
<i>is a perfect match</i>
<i>for the mackerel.</i>

39
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,206
<i>Mackerel's in season now,</i>
<i>and paired with spring cabbage,</i>

00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,872
<i>It's just like a</i>

42
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,572
Mackerel...

43
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:00,039
Yes!

44
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,706
Yukihira's No. 20
from our secret menu!

45
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:04,039
"Yukihira"?

46
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,506
That's the name of
our family restaurant.

47
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,106
[SOMA]
I will use mackerel as
the ingredient, too.

48
00:04:09,206 --> 00:04:11,406
It's one of our most
popular dishes.

49
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:15,272
And just like your dish,
mine will have a spring
theme as well.

50
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,339
Ahmm... Uhh?

51
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,906
Buh! I fell asleep...

52
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:30,139
[RYOKO]
Oh, gosh! I think I drank
too much special rice juice!

53

(Sizzling)
[BOTH]
Hm?

54
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,372
[YUKI]
Huh? Soma's cooking?

55
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,939
[RYOKO]
Um... Maybe he's
still hungry.

56
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,372
No, it's a
cooking battle.

57
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:42,539
Oh, Shun, you were
awake this whole time?

58
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,772
Wait! They're
really facing off?!

59
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:45,872
How'd this happen?!

60
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,672
Beats me.

61
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:48,939
But it was Isshiki..

62
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,172
He was the one who
threw down the gauntlet.

63
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:52,572
[GIRLS]
Uh!

64
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,739
[YUKI]
Um, shouldn't we be talking
about someone's lack of clothes?

65
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,039
[RYOKO]
I don't know. It'd be a
shame to ruin the mood.

66
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,072
[YUKI]
I guess.

Yukihira secret menu
No. 20: revamped!

70
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,306
Mackerel onigiri chazuke!

71
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:18,972
Now it really should
be done using salmon,

72
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:22,272
but I wanted to make
a slightly different
version using mackerel.

73
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,306
There's enough for
everybody, so please
dig in, guys!

74
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,106
Ah! Thank you very much!

75
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,972
Okay, so what do
we have here?

76
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,306
[SOMA]
Salted seaweed tea.

77
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:33,239
It's bold, but its
lightly salted flavor

78
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,039
should finish out
the meal perfectly.

79
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,339
GAH!

80
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,872
If you cook up
something like this,

81
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,572
you're gonna
make us all hungry!

82
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,906
Got that right.

83
00:05:42,006 --> 00:05:45,306
[ISSHIKI]
<i>Okay, it looks like simple,</i>
<i>normal ochazuke.</i>

84
00:05:45,406 --> 00:05:49,472
<i>This dish would be served at</i>
<i>any cheap family eatery.</i>

85
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,806
<i>Unless...</i>

86
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,806
Don't mind if I do!

87
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,472
Eat it, everyone!

88
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,406

This is looking good.

89
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:57,906
(Slurp)

Mm! Mmm...

91
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,406
Mmmmmm...

92
00:06:03,506 --> 00:06:04,372
Delicious!

93
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:06,872
The mackerel is perfectly juicy,

94
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,072
but the skin is still
nice and crispy!

95
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,572
[YUKI]
The flavor pops out
with every bite!

96
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,772
This kind of texture
wouldn't be possible by
simply broiling it.

97
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:16,339
How did he do this?

98
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,072
[ISSHIKI]
Poele...
Hm?

99
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,939
This mackerel was cooked
using the poele method.

100
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,306
Po...e...le?

101
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:25,239
Why are YOU acting
so surprised, too?!

102
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,906
Uh, I'm just not sure
what "poele" is...

103
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:29,872
Huh?!

104
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,406
It's time to learn, kids:

105
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:34,106
Poele is a French method
used to cook protein.

106
00:06:34,206 --> 00:06:35,739
It is a style of saute.

107
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,606
[ISSHIKI]
Olive oil is poured on
top of the protein,

108
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:41,972
basting it if you will, giving
it a consistent browning.

109
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,772
Would you mind telling me,
Young Soma?

110
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:48,139
Where did you happen to learn
your French cooking techniques?

111
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,172
From my dad. He's my mentor.

112
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,172
He taught me how
to cook like this.

113
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:54,806
He said it's perfect for making
fish nice and crispy.

114
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:57,806
[SOMA]
The crunchiness goes great
on a bed of rice,

115
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:01,606
or you can add seaweed tea
to give it a whole different
texture.

116
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,672
It all depends on what
you're trying to do.

117
00:07:03,772 --> 00:07:05,139
Hm...

118
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:08,306
So, it appears your father
has studied French cuisine?

119
00:07:08,406 --> 00:07:11,139
I'm not sure, I couldn't really
tell you anything about that...

120
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:14,706
But it sure seems like
he's studied in several
different countries, though.

121
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,239
I can see that.

122
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,572
[ISSHIKI]
<i>Who could've imagined</i>

123
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:19,772
<i>onigiri done in</i>
<i>a French fashion?</i>

124
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,939
<i>He's bound by neither genre</i>
<i>nor nationality...</i>

125
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,939
<i>This cooking is so free!</i>

126
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,372
<i>And poele was the perfect</i>
<i>choice, given the thickness of</i>
<i>the fish's skin.</i>

127
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:32,239
<i>Ideal for both salmon and</i>
<i>mackerel.</i>

128
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,239
<i>Young Soma made that</i>
<i>determination in an instant,</i>

129

<i>and arranged his menu</i>

<i>The pure white of the rice</i>
<i>is like newly fallen snow!</i>

<i>flavor is so pronounced...</i>

132
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,572
<i>It is the essence</i>
<i>of spring itself!</i>

133
00:07:53,672 --> 00:07:54,906
<i>With this dish,</i>

00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,239
Beats me. Who ever knows
what he's thinking?

176
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,672
There's really no point in
wondering what a freak‐a‐zoid
like him is thinking anyway.

177
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:04,272
[AOKI]
So sleepy!

178
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,106
[YUKI]
Well, goodnight,
Megumi.

179
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,706
[MEGUMI]
Yeah, goodnight.

180
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,072
[ISSHIKI]
Well, Young Soma,

181
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:12,806
With these festivities,
you are officially

182
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:14,972
one of us here at Kyokusei.

183
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,439
(Yawn)

184
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,406
If you have any concerns,
do not hesitate to ask.

185
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:22,039
In that case...

186
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,506
How does someone
join the Ten?

187
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:25,606
Hm?

188
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,172
(Laugh)

189
00:10:32,272 --> 00:10:33,806
[ISSHIKI]
Oh, yes!

190
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,406
You ARE out to take
the top spot

191
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,239
at the Academy,
aren't you?

192
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,872
So I must ask you then...
what keeps you so motivated?

193
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:45,139
[SOMA]
The truth is, my dad and I are
kind of at odds at the moment.

194
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,439
Unless I can become
a member of The Ten,

195
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,506
he won't acknowledge
what I can do.

196
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:53,106
That battle we just had
may have been a draw, but...

197
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,272
If I do end up
beating you...

198
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:59,606
would that make me
the new Tohtsuki No. 7?

199
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:02,372
Heh.

200
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:04,272
This is wonderful!
WHA?!

201
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,239
You have such powerful
ambition, Young Soma!

202
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:09,572
[ISSHIKI]
I'm so ridiculously
moved right now!

203
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:13,272
That's exactly what
it takes for a student
to thrive here at Kyokusei!

204
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,106
Uh... Okay...
(Gleeful yelling)

205
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:18,172
[ISSHIKI]
Alas, we must postpone that
discussion for another day.

206
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:19,739
It's getting
pretty late.

207
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,506
We should probably get
some rest, okay?

208
00:11:22,606 --> 00:11:24,972
Yeah... I guess
you're right.

209
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:27,772
<i>Take the top spot</i>
<i>at Tohtsuki, huh?</i>

210
00:11:27,872 --> 00:11:33,172
<i>I believe the true weight</i>
<i>of those words will</i>
<i>soon become clear.</i>

211
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,906
[SOMA]
So, um, my name's Soma Yukihira.

212
00:11:36,006 --> 00:11:39,139
And well, to be honest it's an
honor to attend this school.

213
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,339
As a stepping stone
in my career.

214
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,072
I might as well
take the top spot.

215
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:47,506
<i>Young Soma, you will</i>
<i>come to learn...</i>

216
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:52,739
<i>at this school,</i>
<i>cooking is everything.</i>

217
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,606
[ERINA]
Your main ingredient
will be eggs.

218
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:14,739
Make me one proper dish.

219
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,406
Those whose plate impresses
me may transfer.

220
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,272
All others will be forever
banned from the Academy.

221
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,072
Shut up and give me
that bowl, you idiot!

222
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:24,739
DISGUSTING!

223
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,339
I'll make myself clear:

224
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,272
I do not approve
of this decision.

225
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,506
Not of you and not of
your peasant cooking!

226
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:33,872
"Take the top spot," will you?
Don't make me laugh.

227
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,606
[ERINA]
All the students who've advanced
from the middle school division

228
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,439
have learned cutting‐edge
gastro techniques!

229
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,972
You don't have nearly
enough training for this.

230
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:44,139
There's no way you
can measure up to them.

231
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,839
Have fun trying
to play catch up!

232
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,772
(Long laugh)

233
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:02,439
Mmmm...

234
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:05,872
I'm gonna ferment...

235
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:11,872
Uh. Huh? Hey, Bonnie.

236
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,172
(Oinking)

237
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:15,339
Hm?
(Quacking)

238
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:16,672
Heavy!

239
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,506
(Yawn)

240
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,572
Hi there, guys...
Good Morning.

241
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,472
GAH! They always,
ALWAYS mess up my room!

242
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,806
I'm gonna tell em like it is,

243
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,772
no more, not ever, I am done
with those mouth‐breathers!

244
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:35,306
AGHH!

245
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,272
[AOKI]
'Sup?

246
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:39,039
[SATO]
How's it going?

247
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,372
[BOTH]
Huh?

248
00:13:40,472 --> 00:13:41,706
(Yawn)

249
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,806
What is it?
What's going on?

250
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,406
(Upbeat music)

251
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:49,272
[SOMA]
We put it off last night...

252
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,872
But now, with your
No. 7 seat on the line...

253
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:55,172
Satoshi Isshiki...
I challenge you!

254
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:56,239
(Music ends abruptly)

255
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,106
(Tap Tap Tap)

256
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,672
(Groans and yawns)

257
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,239
Hm!

258
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,606
Hm?

259
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,172
Hm?

260
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:10,672
Hello?

261
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:11,806
[SATO]
We should it.

262
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:13,239
[YUKI]
I'm so freakin' starving!

263
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,772
[AOKI]
Hey, Gramma, you done yet?

264
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:18,239
Stop complaining and wait
patiently, you big ol' babies!

265
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:20,306
[ISSHIKI]
I'm sorry, Young Soma.

266
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,772
I failed to explain
things well.

267
00:14:21,872 --> 00:14:24,406
HM?!
[ISSHIKI]
About how challenges work

268
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:26,572
here at Tohtsuki Academy.

269
00:14:26,672 --> 00:14:32,572
(Crowd cheering)

270
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,639
[SCHOOLGIRL]
Good luck!

271
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,139
Dosukoi! Hah!

272
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:51,306
[GODABAYASHI]
We of the Chanko Stew Society

273
00:14:51,406 --> 00:14:56,306
have a long and noble history,
stretching back to the
Academy's very founding.

274
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,772
And yet, Erina Nakiri,
you wish to demolish it.

275
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,839
In order to build
what exactly?!

276
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,872
A cooking annex
for my personal use.

277
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:07,039
My fifth kitchen
has gotten a wee bit
crowded for my taste‐

278
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,072
How dare you!

279
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,606
That grand
historic building

280
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:11,406
is home to a long
passion for eating

281
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:14,006
fostered by the students
of Tohtsuki Academy!

282
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:15,572
It's not for you
to toss aside!

283
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,339
How can you even
call yourself a chef?!

284
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,406
[SUMO 1]
Yeah, that's right!

285
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,506
Miss Erina...

286
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:23,806
(Sigh)

287
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,972
Trying to imitate the recipes
of those senior students,

288
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:29,406
while also squandering
away your budget...

289
00:15:29,506 --> 00:15:31,606
Is that YOUR grand idea
of "passion"?

290
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:32,806
Uh?!

291
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,206
These past
few years,

292
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:35,872
you've contributed
little of value.

293
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:39,372
A society that
merely praises its
past accomplishments

294
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,472
isn't needed
here at Tohtsuki.

295
00:15:41,572 --> 00:15:44,206
You are always quick to
flaunt your authority...

296
00:15:44,306 --> 00:15:46,306
Someone needs to put
you in your place!

297
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,472
If I beat you, you will step
down from the council!

298
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:52,172
I challenge you!
Let's go Erina Nakiri!

299
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:55,806
And if I win, construction
continues as planned.

300
00:15:55,906 --> 00:15:59,139
Ready, Godabayashi?

301
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,539
Let the battle begin.

302
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:05,539
[ISSHIKI]
Here at the Academy,
there's a system

303
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:08,806
for resolving disputes
between students.

304
00:16:08,906 --> 00:16:11,939
And it involves following
a few specific rules.

305
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,506
[ISSHIKI]
You may challenge me for
the No. 7 seat if you wish,

306
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:20,539
but the guidelines state that
you must offer something
of corresponding value.

307
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,139
What would be considered
"corresponding value"?

308
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,406
For something to the level
of losing my council seat...

309
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:28,839
Even you being expelled
wouldn't be adequate.

310
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:30,106
Guh! Why not?!

311
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,306
That's right.

312
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:32,406
That's how much weight

313
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:33,806
the Council of Ten carries.

314
00:16:33,906 --> 00:16:35,272
[FUMIO]
After all,

315
00:16:35,372 --> 00:16:37,572
they're the highest
decision‐making body on campus.

316
00:16:37,672 --> 00:16:42,972
Not even the teachers can
go against a ruling made
by the Council of Ten.

317
00:16:43,072 --> 00:16:48,772
In the past, residents from
this very dorm would join the
prestigious Ten every year.

318
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:52,139
It was truly the Golden Age
of Kyokusei's dormitory.

319
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:54,572
By comparison, you're all
just pathetic losers.

320
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,772
Aww, Ms. Fumio, you
don't really mean that.

321
00:16:57,872 --> 00:16:59,506
I guess that
would be that...

322
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,539
You could battle me only
if I accepted the challenge,

323
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,272
and to be honest I would not
prefer you leaving the school.

324
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,839
Put simply... this challenge
is not going to happen.

325
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:11,406
Are you serious?

326
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:14,172
But I've been up since 5 in
the morning all ready to go!

327
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,706
In any case,
going for the No. 7 seat...

328
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:18,106
...is too ambitious!

329
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:20,139
They'd probably
think you were
some kinda idiot.

330
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,872
[ISSHIKI]
And it's not like you can
just challenge people on a whim.

331
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,306
Hm?

332
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:26,506
There are three things you
need to challenge someone.

333
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:31,039
First off: You need authorized
officials to declare the
challenge valid.

334
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:33,172
Second: An odd number of judges.

335
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:38,239
And third: The agreement of both
parties as to the conditions of
the challenge.

336
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,006
Only then will things
start to come together.

337
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:43,406
Oh man, that seems like
a lotta hassle.

338
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:45,372
[ISSHIKI]
However, the upside is...

339
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:46,872
When the conditions are met,

340
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:49,606
you are free to battle anyone
who attends the school.

341
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:51,406
(Light gasp)

342
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:55,206
[ISSHIKI]
"Any and all challengers must be
put down through cooking."

343
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,439
That is Tohtsuki's traditional,
one‐on‐one battle mantra.

344
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,506
And it has become known as:

345
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,339
"Food War"!

346
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:06,739
[JUDGE 1]
A judgment has been reached!

347
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,706
In this Food War,
the victor is Erina Nakiri!

348
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,706
(Crowd cheers)

349
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,939
No... What the hell?!

350
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,239
How can this be?

351
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:20,206
[GODABAYASHI]
But the... Stew Society...

352
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,072
What is the matter
with you people?

353
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:24,639
What was wrong with
my lobster hotpot, huh?

354
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,239
Uwaahh...

355
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:34,772
Ah...

356
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:38,372
(Bubbles churning)

357
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,806
Ahh...

358
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:08,172
(Railroad alarm)

359
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,772
(Stampeding footsteps)

360
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:25,906
(Growling)

361
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,472
[ERINA]
Godabayashi...

362
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,872
your dish fails on 27 points.

363
00:19:29,972 --> 00:19:31,672
First, there's the lobster.

364
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,006
You blanched it for
two seconds far too long.

365
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,272
Ehh!

366
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,139
[ERINA]
Next, the oysters produced

367
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,306
a slight off‐flavor that
affected the whole dish.

368
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,206
Guh! Shut up!

369
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,039
As for how the vegetables
were treated‐

370
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:44,306
Shut your mouth!

371
00:19:44,406 --> 00:19:45,839
Do you really think
what you made

372
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:47,306
is that much better
than mine?

373
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:49,206
I have been perfecting
that dish for weeks,

374
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:51,472
just for this challenge!

375
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:53,672
[JUDGE]
Hakkeyoi!

376
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:56,372
AH! Ooooh!

377
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:57,672
[ERINA]
Well, Godabayashi?

378
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,039
Huh?!

379
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:02,772
What do you say to my
langoustine ravioli?

380
00:20:02,872 --> 00:20:05,839
[GODABAYASHI]
<i>The ravioli is steamed</i>
<i>light and fluffy,</i>

381
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,606
<i>while the langoustine inside is</i>
<i>plump and bursting with flavor.</i>

382
00:20:09,706 --> 00:20:10,439
Mm!

383
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:12,306
(Struggling)

384
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:21,339
[GODABAYASHI]
<i>The sheer delicacy of it</i>
<i>is like being at the mercy</i>
<i>of a champion yokozuna!</i>

385
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:24,206
<i>This is a different</i>
<i>dimension of flavor!</i>

386
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,139
It's immaculate!

387
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,872
Uuhhh. Uhh.

388
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:33,406
(Groaning)

389
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,872
It's me. I won.

390
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:41,306
Huh?
[ERINA]
Take it down.

391
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:46,272
AHH! NO!

392
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:53,139
<i>She's so heartless!</i>

393
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,706
<i>This...</i>

394
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:59,839
<i>This is truly the granddaughter</i>
<i>of the Demon of Food?!</i>

395
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:03,239
Hmm. I'll be seeing you.

396
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:06,272
(Crowd cheers)

397
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:13,772
[SOMA]
"Food Wars," huh?

398
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,139
Okay then. I was kinda hoping
to challenge Erina Nakiri...

399
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,739
Uh. There's no way you
could ever beat her, Soma.

400
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,139
(Satoshi chuckles)

401
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:24,872
I look forward to seeing
how things play out.

402
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:28,506
I am certain he will achieve
some impressive victories.

403
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:33,272
After all, he was able to
cook to a draw against me,
the No. 7 seat.

404
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:36,739
I'm sure you see it too,
don't you, Shun?

405
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,439
Tch. Too early
to tell.

406
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,806
You don't seem to be
taking this very seriously.

407
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:43,506
[SHUN]
You didn't even serve
your specialty.

408
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:48,206
That dish you made is the
definition of playing it safe.

409
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,272
Don't be silly, my friend.

410
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:54,939
I put a great deal of effort
into making that dish special.

411
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,806
Yeah... I'm not
buying it.

412
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:00,239
<i>Young Soma...</i>

413
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:03,939
<i>when I ate your food,</i>
<i>I had a revelation:</i>

414
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,272
[ISSHIKI]
<i>You might be a little</i>
<i>green right now...</i>

415
00:22:09,272 --> 00:22:11,272
<i>But you are going</i>
<i>to be the catalyst</i>

416
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,339
<i>that will bring the academy's</i>
<i>Food Wars to flourish!</i>

417
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,839
(Ending Song)

418
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,206
(Distant crowd cheering)

419
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:51,006
[HISAKO]
That was an excellent
performance, Miss Erina.

420
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,772
[ERINA]
Eh...

421
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:56,572
Defeating that toad
is nothing to brag about.

422
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,672
The entire ordeal
was a disappointment.

423
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:04,606
The Tohtsuki Academy
is in search of nothing
less than perfection.

424
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,839
Give me the list of
the next targets.

425
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:10,806
Uh! M‐ma'am!
It's right here!

426
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:11,906
[IKUMI]
Miss Erina.

427
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:13,139
Hm?

428
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,639
[IKUMI]
Would you allow me to go next?

429
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,506
There's really no need
for you to waste your time

430
00:24:19,606 --> 00:24:22,506
going after these low‐life
imbeciles yourself.

431
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,806
I would like to
handle them for you.

432
00:24:24,906 --> 00:24:26,272
Oh, would you?

433
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:28,306
Now that sounds
promising.

434
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,506
But well, you do know what
that entails, don't you?

435
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:32,672
(Shink)

436
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:36,239
They don't call me the
"Meat Master" for nothing.

437
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,172
[IKUMI]
And I'll protect that title...

438
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,606
You can bet on that.

439
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:42,106
I will serve up
a flawless victory.

440
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,506
(Giggle)

441
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:51,972
[ISSHIKI]
Next time on Food Wars...

442
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:56,039
Oh, it's already
the sixth course, huh?

443
00:24:56,139 --> 00:24:58,106
"The Meat Aggressor"

444
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:01,606
Just wonderful!

445
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:02,672
[ERINA]
You want some?

446
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:04,806
[HISAKO]
You know I do!
