1
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:05,333
[KOJIRO]
I am the Master Chef here!

2
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:08,900
You do not have the authority to
try to question my decisions.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,633
I cannot allow some peon
to butcher my dish.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,433
[KOJIRO]
Megumi Tadokoro...

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,766
You're out.

6
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:17,433
(Grunt)

7
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,766
I'm challenging you.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,366
If I beat you in a
Food War challenge,

9
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:27,766
will you take back your
decision to expel Megumi?

10
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,266
A Food War?

11
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,433
Ha! That brings back memories.

12
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,433
What is that
idiot transfer
student thinking?

13
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:41,800
He's going up against
a graduate, a former
seat No. 1 at that!

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,266
Totally, and Chef Shinomiya is
a beast who fights on the front
lines of the culinary world!

15
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,133
A Food War against
a graduate chef.

16
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,666
It's not unheard of,

17
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,300
but a Food War requires the
consent of both parties.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Correct?

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,166
Sorry, I'm in no mood to
take on a challenge.

20
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,033
You can carry on all you want,

21
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,033
but Megumi Tadokoro's
expulsion is going to‐

22
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:04,966
[GIN]
Easy now, don't be so hasty.

23
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:09,300
It looks like things have
gotten rather exciting,
haven't they?

24
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,366
Oh!

25
00:01:10,466 --> 00:01:11,700
Chef Dojima.

26
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,066
(Whimper)

27
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,333
(Opening Song)

28
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:53,703
[GIN]
Hmm. I see.

29
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:01,470
Oh! Her dish is so well done.
How can you not agree with that?

30
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,937
Something like this totally
deserves a passing grade.

31
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,970
Kojiro, why are you
so stubborn?!

32
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,503
You are a pig‐headed fool!
And a complete narcissist!

33
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:10,837
A show‐off dum dum!

34
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:12,503
Shut your mouth, Hinako.

35
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:14,503
I‐I‐I‐I'm sorry.

36
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,270
(Pained groans)

37
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,070
[HINAKO] He's a meanie...
[KOJIRO] Chef Dojima,

38
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,803
this challenge was supposed
to have been left only to me.

39
00:03:20,903 --> 00:03:22,237
[GIN]
Of course, Kojiro.

40
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:24,637
I have no qualms with the
parameters of your test

41
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,470
or your criteria for judgment.

42
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,270
But at the very least,
this girl tried to cope
with the situation at hand.

43
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,870
Don't you believe that
her grit leaves some
room for consideration?

44
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,903
No, I do not.
Not in the slightest.

45
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:39,037
Well I think it DOES
leave some room!

46
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:42,703
Well, looks like there's
no way of avoiding it,
we have too many votes.

47
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:43,770
These guys...

48
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,337
It is decided.

49
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,737
I will manage this
unofficial Food War.

50
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,603
Or, rather, this offsite match.

51
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:50,703
Huh?

52
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:51,870
[GIN]
However, we cannot disrupt

53
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,737
the training camp's
programming...

54
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,470
so you two will battle
against Kojiro

55
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,870
once the afternoon's
challenges have concluded.

56
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,970
[KOJIRO]
Hold on...
Now wait just a minute!

57
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,670
Why do I have to take
part in this‐

58
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:05,270
Because, Kojiro... I said so.

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,503
Uggh...

60
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,337
Aggh...

61
00:04:08,437 --> 00:04:09,537
Very well then.

62
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:12,337
I will go along with this
whimsical idea of yours.

63
00:04:12,437 --> 00:04:13,937
Okay, Soma,

64
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:17,137
if you win, I'll take
back her expulsion.

65
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,070
However...

66
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,203
If you lose, you and Megumi
will both be sent home.

67
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:26,203
[GIN]
Then, it's settled.

68
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:29,203
I invite you to the basement
of the hotel annex this evening.

69
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,603
You two will show
me what you've got.

70
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,303
Uh...

71
00:04:34,403 --> 00:04:38,837
Well... we just might
be able to turn this
thing around, won't we?

72
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:42,770
But first things first,
we need to take care of business
at the afternoon challenge.

73
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,337
(Angry squeal)
Gah!

74
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:46,437
Soma, you idiot!

75
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,503
Why would you go and
confront him like that?!

76
00:04:48,603 --> 00:04:49,770
I don't believe you!

77
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,303
You already passed
the stupid test!

78
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:53,903
(Sobbing)

79
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,203
Come on, Soma, just let
me fail on my own...

80
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:04,937
(Crying)

81
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,470
Megumi...

82
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,370
I can't let you fail
on your own, you'll mess
that up too! (Laugh)

83
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,037
Do you have to make
fun of me right now?!

84
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:18,037
Come on, get up.

85
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:20,970
We don't want to be late
for the afternoon challenge.

86
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,937
You're always
helping me.

87
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:25,570
And now I've gotten
you involved in THIS.

88
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,103
How can I...

89
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,403
How can I ever
make it up to you?

90
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,337
There's no need.

91
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,303
I did this because I wanted to.

92
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:35,037
You don't owe me
anything, m'kay?

93
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:38,237
Also, the reason I challenged
him should be obvious.

94
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:46,170
[SOMA]
Megumi, this journey was not
meant to end for you here.

95
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,337
[RYOKO]
Well?

96
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:55,637
[YUKI]
Nothing. She wasn't
in her room, either.

97
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,537
She's not answering
her phone.

98
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:00,770
This is not like her.
I wonder if something bad
happened in class.

99
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,603
All teams should've
finished their afternoon
challenges by now.

100
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,070
Don't tell me...

101
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,503
Her name wasn't on the list
of those who failed today.

102
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,170
Why don't we ask
someone who was in
the same challenge?

103
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,137
Oh, yeah! Soma
would've been
with her, right?

104
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:15,403
Where is he anyway?

105
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,703
Yeah, I haven't
seen that
dude either.

106
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,903
Huh...

107
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,237
Let's see here...

108
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,770
Those two started
a Food War

109
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,370
when they were
involved with Bowl‐club.

110
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,370
Actually, Soma was
responsible for that.

111
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:29,570
[ALL]
I've got a bad
feeling about this!

112
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,137
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh...

113
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,570
[GIN]
Tohtsuki Resort's hotel annex
won't be used in this year's
training camp.

114
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,937
So here, in the 1st‐floor
basement kitchen...

115
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,303
...there will be no
distractions.

116
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,970
Huh?!

117
00:06:56,703 --> 00:07:00,037
So, um, why are all these
graduates in here with us?

118
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,003
They've come here to
act as our judges.

119
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,737
(Groans)
[GIN]
Hinako's judgment would seem to
be rather biased, however.

120
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:09,603
An unofficial Food War right in
the middle of training camp.

121
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:12,903
On top of that, a graduate
vs. a freshman student...

122
00:07:13,003 --> 00:07:15,837
I wonder what Mr. Chapelle
would think about this.

123
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,103
He'd tear us a new one.
Not in the good way.

124
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,670
If he found out,
I'd make a run for it.

125
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,770
And blame everything
on Kojiro.

126
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,870
Uh, I can hear you, Mizuhara!

127
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,370
May I have everyone's attention.

128
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,470
We'll now begin
our offsite match.

129
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,470
You'll use these leftover
vegetables to make your
dishes for the challenge.

130
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,103
You're free to make
whatever you like,

131
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:38,570
but have vegetables
be the main component.

132
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,103
Time limit is set at two hours.

133
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:44,303
[MEGUMI]
<i>I'm the one who caused</i>
<i>this Food War...</i>

134
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:49,170
<i>There's no way I can let Soma</i>
<i>get expelled because of me!</i>

135
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,237
<i>I have to at least make sure</i>
<i>I don't hold him back!</i>

136
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:55,737
Also, there will be
one more condition...

137
00:07:55,837 --> 00:07:57,237
Megumi Tadokoro...

138
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,303
you will be the lead chef.

139
00:07:59,403 --> 00:07:59,803
Uhn!

140
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:01,003
Huh?!

141
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:02,970
You'll decide the
recipe on your own.

142
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,370
Soma, you'll act as
sous‐chef and support her.

143
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:05,970
Gah!

144
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,370
This Food War...

145
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,537
will now begin!

146
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:09,503
AHHHHH!

147
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,237
Chef Dojima!

148
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:13,103
I am the one who
wanted this Food War!

149
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:14,437
So why would I not
be the one to‐

150
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,670
I brought together a
challenge that otherwise

151
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,070
would never have happened.

152
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,337
You will accept the
conditions I've set.

153
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:20,770
I know but, sir‐!

154
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,870
Soma!

155
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,703
Let's say Megumi survives

156
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,137
thanks to YOUR cooking.

157
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,470
What merit is
there in that?

158
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,737
It does nothing to
show us what she's got.

159
00:08:28,837 --> 00:08:29,670
(Gasp)

160
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,103
[GIN]
Sooner or later,

161
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:33,170
she will just end up failing
some other challenge.

162
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,770
She cannot continue
to rely on you.

163
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,103
At Tohtsuki Academy,
you must show your worth
by your own hands.

164
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:44,103
You must prove if you
should remain here.

165
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,903
And prove it yourself.

166
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:51,537
Tonight, right now,
at this cooking station...

167
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,370
Megumi,

168
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,370
YOU are the chef.

169
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:01,670
[KOJIRO]
Chef Dojima...

170
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,737
I've already decided
what I'll make.

171
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,103
Would it be okay
with you if I begin?

172
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:08,670
[GIN]
Yes, feel free.

173
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,703
Heh.

174
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,203
Huh?

175
00:09:13,737 --> 00:09:19,537
(Whimpering)

176
00:09:19,637 --> 00:09:22,437
[KOJIRO]
Hmph! I kinda feel
bad for you, kid.

177
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,303
How so?

178
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:26,670
You have the world
crashing down on you.

179
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,437
And your fate is resting
solely in the hands
of a petrified dimwit.

180
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,070
(Groan)

181
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,237
Can you believe what
that wretched man
just said about her?

182
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:38,303
Kojiro Shinomiya
is a horrible person.

183
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,237
And that's precisely why
he's never been able

184
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,770
to keep a girl
for very long.

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,037
Shut up over there!

186
00:09:43,137 --> 00:09:45,070
Hinako, when did you
get out of your ropes?

187
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,237
Good luck,
my tiny sweet Megumi!

188
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,870
Don't you listen to that
arrogant horse's ass!

189
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,303
[KOJIRO]
Shut up!

190
00:09:58,461 --> 00:09:59,909
[MEGUMI]
<i>Chef Kojiro Shinomiya...</i>

191
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,176
<i>After graduating from Tohtsuki,</i>

192
00:10:02,276 --> 00:10:04,043
<i>he went to France on his own</i>

193
00:10:04,143 --> 00:10:05,843
<i>and opened up a</i>
<i>restaurant in Paris,</i>

194
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,443
<i>the fiercest battleground</i>
<i>for fine dining.</i>

195
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,909
<i>How am I to fight a man</i>
<i>like that with MY recipe?</i>

196
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,309
<i>I have to calm down.</i>

197
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,376
<i>I have to be brave...</i>
<i>But I...</i>

198
00:10:18,476 --> 00:10:20,343
<i>I'm drawing a blank.</i>

199
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:21,743
<i>I can't stop shaking.</i>

200
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,276
<i>I can't think of anything.</i>

201
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,243
Ah! Megumi!

202
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:25,476
Incidentally...

203
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:28,709
you will not be
helping her with
her recipe either.

204
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:31,109
You are nothing more
than her sous‐chef.

205
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,176
Got it? She's the
one in charge.

206
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:37,009
[GIN]
You thought Megumi was worthy
of moving on, didn't you?

207
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:40,276
If you're saying you don't
really believe that...

208
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:44,443
Then you should leave now...
Withdraw from the challenge.

209
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:47,376
I'm not going to do that,

210
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:48,943
because I am a chef.

211
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:53,509
A proper chef would never run
away from the kitchen.

212
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,543
Hmph!

213
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:59,176
(Heavy breathing)

214
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:06,243
<i>It's happening,</i>
<i>just like always.</i>

215
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:08,476
<i>I'm blanking.</i>
<i>I can't do it!</i>

216
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,109
<i>I've only made it this far</i>
<i>because of Soma.</i>

217
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,876
[SOMA]
Hey, Megumi...
<i>I'm just...</i>

218
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,276
Put your hands together.

219
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,109
Your hands! Do it!

220
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,343
Ah!

221
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:19,543
Uh.

222
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:21,476
Huh?

223
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:23,376
That really hurt...

224
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,076
[SOMA]
I learned that
from back home.

225
00:11:25,176 --> 00:11:27,276
It's how I was taught
to get my mind right.

226
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:30,109
The only drawback is you
can't do it by yourself.

227
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:32,276
Ah!

228
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:35,543
<i>It stings, But...</i>

229
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,343
<i>I stopped shaking.</i>

230
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,209
The first thing you need
to do is just calm down.

231
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:42,776
Then focus only on
what you want to make.

232
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:44,209
But...

233
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:47,176
But Chef Shinomiya's
going to make French
cuisine.

234
00:11:47,276 --> 00:11:48,843
He's a master.

235
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,009
If I don't make something
special to beat that...

236
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,376
you're going to
get expelled, Soma!

237
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:54,509
[SOMA]
It's like my
dad said...
Huh?

238
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:58,109
"Cooking is about taking
everything that is in
your heart and soul

239
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,009
and putting onto a plate."

240
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,443
[SOMA]
So for now,

241
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,743
you need to forget
about what the other
guy's making.

242
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:08,309
Yes but...
But my cooking is just‐

243
00:12:08,409 --> 00:12:11,543
That onigiri of yours
I ate out in the fields...

244
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:13,209
It was incredible.

245
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:19,876
[SOMA]
Don't overthink this.

246
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:22,743
Just make the kind of food
YOU would want to eat.

247
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,843
That'll be enough.

248
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:28,443
The kind of food that I'D eat?

249
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:04,209
[KOJIRO]
Well, this is... interesting.

250
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:07,276
She hasn't even bothered to
start cooking anything yet.

251
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,176
Your little friend isn't
really all there, is she?

252
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:14,709
Why don't you wait till AFTER
you've tasted her food
before talking trash about her?

253
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:16,109
Hmph!

254
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,376
Soma!

255
00:13:17,476 --> 00:13:18,476
Yeah?

256
00:13:18,576 --> 00:13:22,276
I'm ready... I've decided!

257
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:24,243
I know what I'm making.

258
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:26,243
[HINAKO]
What are you
doing, Kojiro?!

259
00:13:26,343 --> 00:13:29,076
This is abuse!
Untie me! Untie me!

260
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:30,943
[KOJIRO]
If you don't shut
your trap right now,

261
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,776
I am going to
tape your mouth shut!

262
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:36,409
Oh, well at least
something worked.

263
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,676
[YUKI]
He challenged a graduate
to a Food War?!

264
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,043
Uh‐huh. That's totally
what a guy in their
class said.

265
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,376
But why?! How did
things come to that?

266
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:49,976
It looks like Megumi
was going to be chopped,
so Soma stepped in.

267
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:52,076
They were gonna
expel her?!

268
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:53,743
Oh, no!

269
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:55,076
[YUKI]
I can't deal with this!

270
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:57,843
(Sobbing)
[RYOKO]
Yuki, calm down.

271
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:10,509
[MEGUMI]
So, that's the dish
I thought I'd make.

272
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,343
Hmph!

273
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,509
Interesting!

274
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:16,309
Uh? Really?
You like it?

275
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,576
That's great!

276
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,076
Oh, um, but the
ingredients...

277
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:20,743
There will need to be
a lot of prep work

278
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,276
and it will have to
be done very quickly.

279
00:14:22,376 --> 00:14:24,709
I don't know if we
can pull it off...

280
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,809
Hey hey! Who do
you think I am?

281
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,343
(Swish)

282
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:31,943
I am the number‐two guy at the
"Japanese Eatery Yukihira"!

283
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:35,176
Well it's really just the two of
us, y'know, me and my dad.

284
00:14:35,276 --> 00:14:39,176
(Laughs)

285
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:42,876
I'm gonna support you with
everything I know! Okay!

286
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:47,476
For one day only,
"Eatery Megumi Tadokoro",
is open!

287
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,143
Woo! Yeah!

288
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:50,943
[SOMA]
All right, Chef Megumi!

289
00:14:51,043 --> 00:14:53,576
You ready to do this?

290
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:55,909
I am!

291
00:14:56,009 --> 00:14:57,276
[MEGUMI]
I'll do the tomatoes.

292
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,976
Soma, you prep the
rest of the ingredients.

293
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,143
[SOMA]
Got it!

294
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,143
[HINAKO]
Oh, Chef Kojiro!

295
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:04,543
What do you want, Hinako?

296
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:07,109
A Japanese eatery
is a dokoro,

297
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,143
and her name
is Tadokoro,

298
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,176
It kinda has a nice
restaraunty ring
to it, doesn't it?

299
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,176
Erk! Somebody get
her out of here!

300
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:15,709
(Screaming)
Oh, come on!

301
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:19,109
<i>If I think about trying to</i>
<i>beat Chef Kojiro Shinomiya,</i>

302
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,309
<i>I'll get all worked up</i>
<i>and even more nervous.</i>

303
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:23,976
<i>I just have to concentrate</i>
<i>on my own cooking.</i>

304
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:26,743
<i>Because right now,</i>
<i>I'm the chef!</i>

305
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,276
WAAHH!

306
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:30,243
<i>I should've cut the</i>
<i>shoulder first thing!</i>

307
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:32,876
<i>Now the whole cooking order</i>
<i>is going to be off!</i>

308
00:15:32,976 --> 00:15:34,176
Here are the cuts.

309
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,343
I've removed all
the connective tissue.

310
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:40,043
So, should I get on the chicken
liver or the backfat next?

311
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:42,843
U‐um, the liver, if you don't
mind. That would be great.

312
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:44,476
[SOMA]
Comin' up!

313
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,376
Hey, Soma! How's the bake mold
coming along over there?

314
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:49,609
All done. I just need
to add in the paté.

315
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,876
I'll be finished with
the sautéed vegetables
in about 12 seconds.

316
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:54,743
Uh! Thanks so much!

317
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:56,709
<i>Incredible!</i>

318
00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:00,743
<i>He keeps turning out</i>
<i>the pre‐prepped ingredients</i>
<i>exactly when I need them.</i>

319
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,209
This the consistency
you're looking for?

320
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,543
Mm‐hmm!

321
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,143
<i>Even though he's the only</i>
<i>one person supporting me...</i>

322
00:16:07,243 --> 00:16:08,909
<i>my cooking speed</i>
<i>is so much faster!</i>

323
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,976
<i>I can't believe how</i>
<i>quick we're moving.</i>

324
00:16:12,076 --> 00:16:13,609
Are you seeing this?

325
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:16,243
He's supporting her
by anticipating what
she'll be doing next,

326
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,909
thus making sure that
the two of them are
working on the same page.

327
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,443
What's more, he only
focuses on what's needed.

328
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:26,809
He's not in Megumi's way,
he's showing a great
deal of sensitivity.

329
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,209
[SEKIMORI]
Who is he again?

330
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:29,343
Soma Yukihira?

331
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:32,143
Ah yes, this year's
sole transfer student.

332
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:34,009
He works at
a local diner.

333
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,576
It seems he's built his body
of knowledge on the job.

334
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:40,776
Still, he wouldn't have moves
like that just by helping
at the family restaurant.

335
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:46,909
No matter how you look at it,
his skills are far beyond those
of most Tohtsuki's students.

336
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:52,109
All right, everyone,
prepare your dishes!

337
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:55,509
We need to begin
plating, Soma!

338
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:56,376
Gotcha!

339
00:16:56,476 --> 00:16:57,709
(Tick)

340
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,876
[GIN]
Now then, we'll
start the judging.

341
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:04,643
We'll start with Kojiro.
Present your dish!

342
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:08,009
[MEGUIMI]
<i>The cooking of a top graduate</i>
<i>from Tohtsuki Academy...</i>

343
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,109
<i>I'm sure we're going to see</i>
<i>something pretty special.</i>

344
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,083
Man, I've been looking
forward to this.

345
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,483
Yes.

346
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:19,383
Hmm...

347
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,349
Huh?

348
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:23,016
[GOTODA]
A chou farci!

349
00:17:23,116 --> 00:17:25,783
This is quite an unexpected
surprise from you.

350
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:28,283
It's a local dish of the
Auvergne region.

351
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:31,883
[SEKIMORI]
Meat and vegetables
are minced and stuffed
into cabbage leaves

352
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,283
which are rolled and steamed.

353
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:36,716
Similar to the cabbage rolls
of many other cuisines.

354
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:40,916
It's a staple of local cooking,
most often prepared
in French households.

355
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,816
This must be kind of a let down
for him, don't you think?

356
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:48,116
Kojiro usually only makes
pretentious food, but this‐ OH!

357
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,516
Wait a minute...

358
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,149
Don't I get a
serving as well?

359
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:52,049
You don't get one.

360
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:53,583
You can share
with Mizuhara.

361
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,383
[GOTODA]
Well then...

362
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,849
Oh my goodness!

363
00:17:58,949 --> 00:18:02,016
The aroma of the herbs
simply whets the appetite!

364
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:06,483
Ah!

365
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,916
(Squealing)

366
00:18:10,016 --> 00:18:11,649
Ahhhh!

367
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:16,183
This... is... magnifique!!

368
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:18,149
Um...
this filling...

369
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,816
It isn't the pork roast
and onions used in a
normal chou farci.

370
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:24,449
It's a farci made
from local duck!

371
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:26,416
He sliced the breast meat open

372
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,983
and stuffed with morel
mushrooms, asparagus,
and foie gras,

373
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,116
all sautéed in beef fat to give
them depth of flavor.

374
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:36,483
What's more, the breast meat,
butter, and cream were
blended into a mousse,

375
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,216
inserted and then steamed!
AhHhH!

376
00:18:39,316 --> 00:18:41,716
<i>This mousse lingers</i>
<i>on the tongue.</i>

377
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,349
<i>And then everything dissolves,</i>

378
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,149
<i>and the rich flavors spread</i>
<i>throughout the mouth.</i>

379
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:47,483
<i>It's so delicate.</i>

380
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,616
What I find most
impressive about this,

381
00:18:49,716 --> 00:18:51,616
is the type of cabbage
that surrounds it.

382
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,649
Savoy cabbage:

383
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,516
This ingredient, called
chirimen cabbage in Japan,

384
00:18:56,616 --> 00:18:58,749
has a strong grassy
scent when raw,

385
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:02,316
but when cooked, it takes
on a sublime sweetness.

386
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,583
Blanchir...

387
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:05,083
Blanching.

388
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,283
Vapeur...

389
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,516
Steaming.

390
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:09,583
This was cooked using
various processes,

391
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,949
each the perfect
complement to the
highlights of the dish.

392
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:20,183
<i>The result is a delicate</i>
<i>sweetness that elevates the</i>
<i>flavors of everything else.</i>

393
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:23,749
<i>It's as if a spell had</i>
<i>been cast on it.</i>

394
00:19:28,316 --> 00:19:33,183
[GIN]
As soon as he graduated from
Tohtsuki, Kojiro went to
France, alone...

395
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:36,583
And after a few years honing
his skills, he opened a
restaurant in Paris,

396
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,916
becoming an chef owner.

397
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:42,049
While French cuisine tends to
emphasize meat dishes,

398
00:19:42,149 --> 00:19:45,516
Kojiro's cooking cast a new
light on legumes.

399
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:47,116
He paved new ground...

400
00:19:47,216 --> 00:19:50,049
and created a shockwave
to gourmands throughout
the country.

401
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,616
In time, the Parisian
connoisseurs of haute cuisine

402
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:56,416
came to respect the chef
who had come from Japan.

403
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,583
And they began to call him...

404
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:02,049
The Legume Magician!

405
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:04,716
<i>He is the worst! I hate him...</i>

406
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:06,649
<i>But it IS delicious!</i>

407
00:20:06,749 --> 00:20:10,983
<i>His heightened creativity has</i>
<i>transformed what is a simple</i>
<i>regional dish.</i>

408
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:14,916
<i>He's elevated it to where</i>
<i>it could be served in a</i>
<i>fine dining establishment.</i>

409
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,316
<i>The duck mousse dissolves</i>
<i>in the mouth,</i>

410
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,349
<i>and the sweetness of the</i>
<i>cabbage that surrounds it...</i>

411
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:21,916
<i>Uhh! it embraces the palate,</i>

412
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:24,283
<i>and then the entire body!</i>

413
00:20:24,383 --> 00:20:28,716
<i>It's as if a kind of flavor</i>
<i>sorcery has possessed the</i>
<i>tongue and freed the soul!</i>

414
00:20:28,816 --> 00:20:29,716
<i>This is...</i>

415
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:30,916
<i>...magic!</i>

416

Indeed. The work of
the Legume Magician.

430
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:52,983
Well, what about you, Mizuhara?
Did it meet your approval?

431
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,349
Oh dear God.

432
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:56,983
If I could just make myself
forget it was you who made it

433
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,416
then it would be perfect.

434
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:00,449
Aw... well I do
apologize for that.

435
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,449
That was rather unexpected,
Kojiro. I must say.

436
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,983
I thought for sure we would be
getting one of the specialties
from your restaurant in Paris.

437
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:12,783
Hm! Oh, come on, Chef Dojima,
that would be just cruel.

438
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:15,049
I mean, I'm going up
against mere students.

439
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,949
Don't you think that being
in my presence is already
humiliating enough

440
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:19,583
for these poor dumb bastards?

441
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,849
How modest of him.

442
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:22,649
I might just have
to beat him so hard

443
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,149
he will never be
able to cook again.

444
