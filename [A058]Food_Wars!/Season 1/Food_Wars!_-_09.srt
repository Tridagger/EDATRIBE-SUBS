Buon appetito.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,433
You've sure come
a long way, Takumi.

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,566
And with Isami here, Aldini's
future is in very good hands.

5
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,166
Takumi... You wanna go
out on a date?

6
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:31,233
You're as cute as always,
Takumi.

00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,266
Why don't you play
with an older girl?

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,566
Oh honey.

9
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,066
We need to go somewhere and
make each other feel good...

10
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,400
Mwah.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,033
Si, grazie.

12
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,366
I do appreciate all
the sentiments,

13
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,100
but there is something
that I must do.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,566
[UNCLE]
So uh... are you really okay
with letting them both go,
brother?

15
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:51,600
[FATHER]
I am.

16
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,400
Now, I may be a bit biased,

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,366
but they have both
grown into excellent chefs.

18
00:00:56,966 --> 00:00:58,933
But Takumi seems...

19
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,633
to have grown a cold
place in his heart.

20
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,166
You're sending us
to cooking school?!

21
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:09,400
Uncle, this really
doesn't make any sense.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,366
Why would we need
to go there?

23
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:14,666
We have been proving ourselves
at Aldini for eight years now.

24
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:17,300
[UNCLE]
Well. You would
benefit greatly by going.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
That school is respected
the world over.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
Just leave everything
to my brother...

27
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,133
Your father will make all
your travel arrangements.

28

Come back once you've managed
to sharpen your skills.

think about this?

31
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,400
I'll just go wherever
you go, brother.

Now sure, my transfer
was kinda unexpected,

39

but I still don't plan on
losing to a bunch of wannabes

40

of a customer before.

I mean, come on, am I right?

42
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,466
Anyway, since I'm here
and everything.

43
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,566
I might as well take
the top spot.

44
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,400

Fine!

[HINAKO]
This salsa verde duck

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,766
was infused with Japanese
elements in a measured and
creative way.

55
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:20,633
A flawless combination
of Japanese technique
and imagination.

Takumi Aldini, Isami Aldini,

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
you both pass!

That was way too fast!

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,233

And they still had time
to dress the duck!

[SCHOOLBOY 2]
That didn't even take an hour!

62
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,133
Well then, Soma Yukihira.

63
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:39,866
It would seem you haven't made
much progress yet.

64
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:43,666
You have a long way
to go to measure up.

65
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,266
Oh yes, right.

66
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,733
You had mentioned a
challenge earlier, didn't you?

67
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,333
Very well.

68
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:52,900
If I'm to expect a dish
as scrumptious as the
previous one,

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,733
I will gladly make an exception,
and weigh in on which is better.

70
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,333
Did you hear
that, Soma?!

71
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,966
Yeah! You're not
gonna hear me object!

72
00:05:02,066 --> 00:05:04,633
The loser will be
forced to grovel.

73
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:07,500
You'll grovel in front
of your opponent and say

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,633
"I'm a loser and a dog!"
three times for all to hear.

75
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,400
If you're putting your

YOU won't have to grovel,

Give it your best shot!

<i>completely on the fly...</i>

<i>to complement its flavor.</i>

85
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,400
<i>Makes me wonder...</i>

86

87

[HINAKO]
Use the ingredients here to
make a dish emphasizing
traditional Japanese cooking.

88
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:02,633
There were a few chickens and
rabbits out there, too.

ingredients as garnish.

Could ya get 'em for me?

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,933
You know what
these are, right?

94
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,866
I think so...

Yes, don't worry
about a thing.

lot of greens back home.

What're you gonna
be doing, Soma?

99
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:28,866
There's something I'm
gonna need to find.

100
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm headed outside.

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,333
Oh! But first...

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,166
Chef Hinako?

103
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:37,266
I can use absolutely
anything

104
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:38,966
within the fenced
boundaries correct?

105
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,566
Yes. Well.

106
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,433
As long as it's within
the permitted area,
use what you like.

107
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,800
Perfect.

108
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,700
In that case a key
ingredient in what

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,200
we are gonna
prepare for you is...

eating that!

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
Looks like we'll be going
back outside again.

these for me? Thanks.

that I can expect.

Ah! I'm sorry! I
wasn't trying to ruin

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,266
your your ingredients!
I promise, man!

174
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, don't worry about it.

175
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
You saved me some work.
Thank you.

176
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
Also, 15 minutes
is plenty of time.

177
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,533
What the...?

178
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,066
If a restaurant
keeps customers waiting,

179
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,066
then they pick up
and go somewhere else.

180
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,400
Here we go, Megumi!

181
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,366
Yeah!

182
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I saved him some work?

183
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,966
Hehe.

184
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:02,833
<i>I need to prep</i>
<i>these wild greens.</i>

185
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,733
<i>First, I'll need to</i>
<i>slice the bottom ends</i>
<i>off the pepper buds.</i>

186
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,800
<i>Careful... Careful...</i>

187
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,900
When you're done with that,
could you separate the yolks
from the whites?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,233
'Kay!

189
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,933
Huh?! A fried dish?

190
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,500
Yup, we'll fry
the fish we caught.

191
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,933
Yeah okay,
I guess...

192
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,133
but we don't have any
flour or cornstarch...

193
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,466
Nothing to act
as a breading.

194
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,633
How do you plan
on deep‐frying it?

195
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,233
The fish has a lot of moisture,

196
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,933
so without any breading it's
not going to fry up properly.

197
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,700
Actually, we do have some.

198
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,633
We've got an excellent
breading!

199
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,033
Uh...

200
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,333
<i>Freshwater fish...</i>

201
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,566
<i>Eggs...</i>

202
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,766
<i>Rice crackers...</i>

203
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:47,133
<i>Ah! I've got it!</i>

204
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:50,266
<i>Soma is going to take</i>
<i>the rice crackers...</i>

205
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:54,666
<i>and crush them to</i>
<i>use as a breading!</i>

206
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,533
All right! We're done!

207
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,100
Chef Hinako...

208
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,500
Please have some
before it gets cold.

209
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,666
Great. This looks good.

210
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:27,766
Oh! My rice crackers were used
to make an excellent fried dish!

211
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,133
(Gasps)

212
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:41,433
Now this has such
a wonderful texture!

213
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:42,766
It's so crispy.

214
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:45,333
And the fish is nice and warm!

215
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:49,066
The coating protected the char,
concentrating its flavor.

216
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,533
[BOTH]
Uhh...

217
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:53,100
[HINAKO]
The flavor of the
rice crackers themselves

218
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,833
gives the coating
another layer of complexity.

219
00:11:55,933 --> 00:12:02,000
And on the side, we have a
light and fluffy sauce using
eggs and pepper buds.

220
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,866
[SCHOOLBOY 1]
He used eggs as a base?

221
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:08,033
And it looks like he added
salad oil to the yolks.
And then whisked it up.

222
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,033
[SCHOOLBOY 2]
Oh yeah. So that's his sauce?

223
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,033
Then he added to the eggs,

224
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:16,166
salt and shaved pepper buds,
the young sansho leaves.

225
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:18,566
That gave it a
refreshing sensation,

226
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:22,866
tempering the oil and
creating a refined flavor.

227
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:27,200
The creaminess of the sauce
glistening between bites
of the crispy coating

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,333
really rouses the appetite.

229
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:33,200
The treatment of the fried
vegetables was skillful as
well.

230
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,666
providing a vibrant
counterpoint to the char.

231
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:38,266

232
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,566

00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,300
<i>And it works.</i>

238
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,833
<i>The rice crackers bound with</i>
<i>a seasonal freshwater fish.</i>

239
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:07,633
<i>It's like a warm embrace</i>

<i>brimming with fiery emotion.</i>

MMmm!

248
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:33,166
Soma, how did you come up
with something like this?

249
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:36,666
We have okaki‐age that's
used in Japanese cooking, right.

250
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,666
We pound down the rice crackers,
then use it as a coating
to fry the ingredients,

251
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,600
giving the dish an unexpected
texture and flavor.

252
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,766
I've made it back home
and it always satisfies.

253
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:51,100
So you came up with
the idea to use kaki no
tane in the same way.

254
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,833
It's called:
"Yukihira‐style okaki‐age..."

255
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,600
Oh! Or now I guess:

256
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,033
"Yukihira‐style
O‐kaki no Tane‐age Char!"

257
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,966
You just thought of that
right now, didn't you?!

258
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,733
Mm...

259
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,433
Had it all planned out!
You're making crap up
as you go along!

260
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:10,166

<i>On the other hand, Soma was</i>
<i>exceptionally creative.</i>

<i>He made something no one</i>

Huh?

Hi, Yuuki. Hi, Ryoko. Heard
anything about the others?

355
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:17,583

to find out right now.

Understood. Thank you.

357

Looks like we all
made it through.

(Zenji groaning)
am I right to say
that Zenji made it?

362
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,516
Apparently he was running around
like a mad man in the mountains.

Nice!

364
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,583
Our group had a
similar challenge.

Gosh, that was
unbelievably exhausting.

and our fancy rooms!

I'm sure they'll be luxurious,

375

utterly gorgeous and comfy!

You'll have some free
time once you're done

making dinner for
these gentlemen.

Who the heck are all
these muscle heads?!

They're members of the Upper Arm
University's Bodybuilding Club,

383
00:19:15,316 --> 00:19:17,450

training camp down the road.

Tonight's meal will
be a steak dinner.

You'll need to make 50 servings
each for this challenge.

Chef Sekimori,
what about OUR dinner?

392
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,583
Once you've made
fifty plates,

393
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:41,183
you are allowed to go ahead
and cook your own dinner.

394
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:44,416
Wait what? We have to do what?

395
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,483
I thought someone
would cook for us.

396
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,883
That's not going to happen.

While you're here,

399
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,083
you'll be in charge of
making your own meals.

400
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,483
That would be breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

401
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,783
Please keep that in mind.

Oh, one more thing:

404

Anyone who is unable to complete
their dishes in an hour,

405
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,283

from the academy.
