find out anyway.

81
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,811
So you're going to be
experimenting with your
beef stew, right now?

82
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,681
I believe there are two
focal points in a beef stew...

83
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,550
the cut of beef to be used
and the demi‐glace sauce.

84
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,752
Sounds simple but I know
there's more to it than that.

85
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,454
Some places specialize
in just this stew.

86
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,757
I hear they spend
two weeks on the sauce...

87
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,926
just letting it simmer down
that whole time.

88
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,260
Unbelievable!

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,196
So... I'm assuming
you chose this dish

90
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,165
because you're confident
you'll be able to make
it in a short time?

91
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,636
Hmm... Whether I'm confident
or not is besides the point...

92
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,371
Ultimately it comes
down to taste!

93
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,608
(Grinding)

94
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:08,575
(Sizzle)

95
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,777
As you can gather by now,

96
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,514
this process will
give the finished dish
a much deeper flavor.

97
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,248
Once the meat's got
a good color goin',

98
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,384
you simmer it in stock and
some bouillon till it's tender.

99
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,154
Then you bring it to a boil,
and skim the fat out.

100
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,489
It already smells
unbelievably delectable!

101
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,895
If you bundle parsley, thyme,
bay leaves, and tarragon
into a petite bouquet garni...

102
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,598
it makes it easy to remove
the aromatics when done.

103
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,000
[MITSURU]
Oh! What a lovely color!

104
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,870
The key is to strain your
demi‐glace once it's simmered.

105
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,905
That will improve
the overall flavor.

106
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,642
Then just season it with some
salt and pepper and voila.

107
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,978
It's really not to terribly
difficult to cook.

108
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,179
Okay... it's done!

109
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,881
[MITSURU]
Wow! It's so rich!

110
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,416
The beef is so shiny and
looks absolutely perfect!

111
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,585
I can't wait to taste it!

112
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,787
Okay, now for a bite...

113
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,322
The chunks of meat
are so thick...

114
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,726
and yet they fall apart
just by using a spoon!

115
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:00,794
Aaah...

116
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:01,862
(Chomp)

117
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,229
Mmm...

118
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,731
The moment it enters the mouth,

119
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,233
the meat just melts away
softly on the tongue.

120
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,870
Its juices explode
with each new chew,

121
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,439
mixing in with the demi‐glace
in a vibrant dance of life!

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,375
(Swallow)

123
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,510
Exquisite!

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,878
I usually think of beef stew

125
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,813
as being really acidic
and tough to chew.

126
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,916
But yours is somehow
so mellow and tender.

127
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,217
Did you notice?

128
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,587
My secret ingredient
is white miso.

129
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,956
The trademark acidity in a beef
stew comes from adding tomatoes.

130
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,793
As you see some people
don't care for them very much.

131
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,295
Adding white miso at the end
while it's still simmering

132
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
will allow for the acidity
to mellow out some.

133
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:41,067
Making something more
in line with what
Japanese people prefer.

134
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,202
Amazing!

135
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,770
I remember comin' up
with this...

136
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,507
I was a 2nd year in
middle school, at the time.

137
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:49,776
I was up late trying to work
on an off‐menu item.

138
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,179
This was the first dish of mine
that my dad said was good.

139
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:58,084
Whoa! You could easily beat
Mimasaka with this dish,
don't you think?

140
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,419
It's really good.

141
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,154
Nah, not even in the runnin'

142
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,925
This is the exact same thing
I served to him yesterday.

143
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,359
Wha?!

144
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,161
Wait, why would you do
something like that?

145
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,331
Well... He would've found out
about it eventually anyway.

146
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,935
Plus, I wanted to try and
level the playing field
for us a bit...

147
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,236
I guess you'd say.

148
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:19,005
This was the best thing I made
before I came to Tohtsuki.

149
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,342
But how far have I evolved
since then, and is it enough?

150
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,312
And will this make Mimasaka
try even harder to try
and replicate my dish?

151
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:30,150
That flavor is just
the starting line
for this competition.

152
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,652
This is gonna be...

153
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,655
a battle of imagination!

154
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,561

<i>a fight to the finish!</i>

156
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,734
[SOMA]
Still no good.

157
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,504
I added some cumin and cardamom
to flavor the meat...

158
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,839
like I learned from
making the curry...

159
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,908
but the aroma is
all off on this.

160
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,544
The demi‐glace is
coming off as too potent.

161
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,313
Adding spices while it's
simmering makes it too strong

162
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,283
while at the same time the
mild flavor is way too sharp.

163
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:06,052
I thought about completely
changing the flavoring agents...

164
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,288
but if the white miso
loses its mellowness,

165
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,356
the dish becomes
something different.

166
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,492
I've tried different ideas...

167
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,861
but I can't seem to find
just the right one.

I had to combat A5‐grade beef.

170
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,336
Then, in the first battle,
I needed to beat
molecular gastronomy.

171
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:27,508
My thinking so far has been
to use my opponent's
specialty against them...

172
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,843
but Mimasaka's an
entirely different breed.

173
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,879
It's like I'm being
chased by my own shadow.

174
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,682
Hey, Mitsuru...
for the next trial dish‐

175
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,584
I'm way too full
to eat more.

176
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,119
Did you really finish
each and every dish?

177
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,722
I couldn't possibly leave
any of that uneaten,

178
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,790
that would be a waste!
(Burp)

179
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,926
It's no good.
I know his heart's in it,

180
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,094
but something about him
is not working.

181
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,232
Is there anyone with a good
sense of taste I can use?

182
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,433
[ERINA]
"You want to...

183
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,401
walk home together, Sachiko?"

184
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,570
"Huh?"

185
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,238
Wait! They only met
a few months ago

186
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:00,707
but they're already
walking together... ALONE?!

187
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,244
It won't be long before
they're holding hands
and whispering sweet nothings.

188
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,746
How lewd of them!

189
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:08,048
Ugh! I don't have the next one.

190
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,250
They can't just
leave me like this!

191
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,652
Hisako!

192
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,820
Where's the next issue?

193
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,757
Oh. That's right...

194
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,525
[ALICE]
Are you serious?

195
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,193
Don't tell me there's no one
you have feelings for

196
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,729
even though you're in
high school surrounded
by gorgeous boys.

197
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,831
You really are completely
hopeless aren't you?

198
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,833
[HISAKO]
When it comes to
learning about love...

199
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,703
girls' manga are the
bible for society at large.

200
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,139
Thank you so much, Hisako!

201
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,877
<i>Hisako always made sure to do</i>
<i>all the legwork for me.</i>

202
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,646
<i>If I wanted something...</i>

203
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,948
<i>she's always been by my side.</i>

204
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,950
(Doorbell rings)

205
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,051
My sweet Hisako!

206
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,320
I knew you'd come back!
I just knew it!

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,689
I've been waiting for you!

208
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,223
(Camera clicks)
[ERINA] Ugh...

209
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,293
Hey, if you're free,
wanna taste something for me?

210
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,128
U‐uh...

211
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,832
Soma Yukihiraaaa!

212
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,567
She has such a glorious smile.

213
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:03,904
Yeah! It's a good thing it looks
like she was welcoming us, huh?

214
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,706
I'm NOT welcoming you.

215
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,407
What are you doing here?

216
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:08,975
Where's my security?

217
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,679
Oh. I ran into your cousin and
Ryo comin' out the front gate.

218
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,480
She said it was alright
if I went in.

219
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,182
<i>Alice!</i>

220
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,952
How incredible! To think
you could have Miss Erina,

221
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,454
the legendary "God Tongue,"
taste your food!

222
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,923
I heard you two
are pretty close,

223
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,125
that you ride in the same car
and talk all the time.

224
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,226
(Taunting)

225
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,493
Enough of this nonsense!

226
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,895
Listen here...

227
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,496
There are strict guidelines
you must follow.

228
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,533
First you must be judged
whether you're suitable or not

229
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,101
and you'll also have to pay
a quite sizeable contract fee!

230
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,505
That's how precious my taste
evaluations are, understand?!

231
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:39,906
Are you serious?

232
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,842
Hey Mitsuru,
how much have you got?

233
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,810
Huh?
You want ME to pay?

234
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,813
How could your pathetic
pocket change possibly be
enough for my palette?!

235
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,281
Well in any case...

236
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,551
I have no time to waste
with you right now.

237
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,252
I'm very busy at the moment.

238
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:55,221
You aren't busy...
you're reading manga.

239
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,723
Uh?!

240
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,759
Stay out of my freakin'
business Soma Yukihira!

241
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:01,762
You know I think someone
at Kyokusei Dorm is reading
that exact same manga.

242
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,830
All of them.
[ERINA] Mm...

243
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,800
[SOMA]
Still, if your answer's no,
then that's that.

244
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,134
Wait right there!

245
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,335
(BOTH)
Huh?

246
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,372
Um... well... I guess I uh...

247
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,641
I'll make an exception today
and have a taste.

248
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,909
I'm feeling charitable.

249
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,078
Huh? But we don't
have any money.

250
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,281
Money is not the only form
of compensation I seek.

251
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,050
There's always room
for some negotiation.

252
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,985
Yeah?

253
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,787
However... given the situation

254
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,922
I won't be able to
give you any advice.

255
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,858
I can only gauge the flavor.

256
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,326
[SOMA]
Well, if you don't mind.

257
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,962
I simmered the beef with
a bouqet of aromatics.

258
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,199
The demi‐glace is homemade too.
The secret ingredient is‐

259
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,266
It's white miso.

260
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,535
(Gasp)

261
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,670
Please remember who you're
talking to here.

262
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,206
I can tell you that much
without even tasting it.

263
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,741
[MITSURU]
<i>Oh wow!</i>

264
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:51,745
<i>She is definitely the</i>
<i>God Tongue all right.</i>

265
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,115
So how is it? You like it?
It's super great, right?

266
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,450
I was so moved when I took
my first bite that I almost...

267
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,985
It's not good.
[MITSURU] Huh?

268
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,087
This may do for some
common walk‐up food truck

269
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,756
out in the sticks somewhere...

270
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:05,458
But you're here competing in
a contest of fine dining.

271
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,227
This isn't even close.

272
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,695
It's a joke really.

273
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,030
You don't have a chance.

274
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,799
You don't understand
this theme at all.

275
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,673
Well... it's time you
take your leave now.

276
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,107
[MITSURU]
Please wait!

277
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,076
Miss Erina, what did you mean
when you said that?

278
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:26,079
How can you say that this
beef stew isn't even close?

279
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,048
[ERINA]
I've given my findings.

280
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,716
You draw the conclusion...

281
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,885
(Sigh)

282
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:34,420
I have nothing more
to offer on the matter.

283
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,422
Toodle‐oo.

284
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,323
[MITSURU]
Aww...

285
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,491
[SOMA]
Hmm...

286
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,760
(Door opens)
Huh?

287
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,227
About my compensation

288
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,296
for suffering through
your sub‐par dish...

289
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,599
I suppose lending me the
next volume of this manga

290
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:46,933
will suffice enough.

291
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,769
I'll let security
know you're coming,

292
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:50,470
so just hand it over
to them at the gate.

293
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,238
Yeah, thanks so much.

294
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,008
[MITSURU]
(Sigh)

295
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,476
I never thought she would

296
00:12:56,577 --> 00:12:58,244
just totally dismiss it
right off the bat.

297
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,780
I thought it was so delicious

298
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,247
I could have eaten a
hundred bowls of it,

299
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,016
I mean I've never had
anything like it.

300
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,851
Yeah, that was rough.

301
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,853
She really tore it
a new one, didn't she?

302
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,254
All she did was
criticize it...

303
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,023
And she didn't even
offer a single hint

304
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,925
or word of advice
to make it better!

305
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,327
Oh!
[SOMA] I'm not so sure.

306
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,461
Huh?

307
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,698
There's something Erina said...

308
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,166
It struck a chord with me...

309
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,436
(Chatter and laughter)

310
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,005
Hey Soma, another one please!

311
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,740
Today's special was
really delicious!

312
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,108
Soma!

313
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,343
[MIMASAKA]
Here ya go. Eat up.

314
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,044
Oh!

315
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,513
Wow!

316
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,280
Your order is up!

317
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,750
[CUSTOMER]
Oh, that is so good!

318
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,418
[OTHER CUSTOMER]
Thanks for the food, man!

319
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,554
Welcome!

320
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,355
[MIMASAKA]
I'm Soma Yukihira.

321
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:45,025
My dream is to one day
surpass my father

322
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,260
and take over as chef
of this place.

323
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,697
This is off‐menu item number 5
at our Japanese eatery...

324
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:52,198
"Yukihira" beef stew!

325
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,100
(Foodgasmic gasp)
It's delicious!

326
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,869
[TOMITA]
I feel so young!

327
00:13:55,969 --> 00:14:00,140
[MIMASAKA]
First thing I gotta do is beat
the snot outta this FLAVOR!

328
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,608
[MIMASAKA]
This was the best thing I made

329
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,177
before I came to
Tohtsuki's Academy...

330
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,580
You're welcome.

331
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,316
[MIMASAKA]
But how far have I
evolved since then,

332
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,686
[MIMASAKA]
and will it be enough?
[EIZAN]
Heh. Back to his image training.

333
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:14,755
[MIMASAKA]
It's a battle of imagination.
[EIZAN]
He does it every single time.

334
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:20,594
[EIZAN]
Well then, Soma Yukihira...
how will you combat this?

335
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,564
[SOMA]
(Frustrated sigh)

336
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:26,166
[MITSURU]
U‐um, Master Soma sir!

337
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:28,569
How about we lighten the mood
a little bit, huh?!

338
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:31,071
Look, the latest issue of TohSpo

339
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,273
published an article on the
upcoming semifinals.

340
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,610
Oh! Chef Dojima and
Chef Mizuhara are coming...

341
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,478
even Chef Inui
is going to be here.

342
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,080
Haven't seen them in a while.

343
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,448
Speaking of, Master Inui's
challenge at the training camp

344
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,418
was a creative dish that
centered around Japanese food.

345
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,754
It's kinda similar to
this challenge, huh?

346
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,889
(Door opens)

347
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,091
Hm?

348
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,626
[SOMA]
Uh.. Meat meat?

349
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,628
What's up?
Is something wrong?

350
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,029
I brought you a present.

351
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,964
I mean, since you're in
Bowl Club and everything.

352
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,967
But it's not like you've got
my support or anything okay.

353
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,103
I just don't want that
big jackass to win.

354
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,270
He's a complete waste of space.

355
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,206
That's so sweet...
Meat Meat.

356
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,609
Shut up! I just said I'm not
doing it for YOU, all right!

357
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:11,344
Anyway, there's no way I'm gonna
let you lose to that A‐hole

358
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,814
and have you not become a chef.
Understand me?!

359
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,617
YOU CANNOT LOSE!!

360
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:22,388
Whoa. There's a sirloin and
filet... and even some rump.

361
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,958
It's an assortment of
different premium cuts.

362
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,060
That's our Meat Meat all right.

363
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,461
They're all top quality.

364
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,197
There's some interesting
items in here as well.

365
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,800
But I'm not sure
I can use these.

366
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,402
If I used this meat
to make a stew...

367
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,671
(Gasp)

368
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:40,941
[ERINA]
You don't understand
this theme at all.

369
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,109
Are you okay, Soma sir?

370
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,545
Is there something wrong?

371
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,748
[SOMA]
I really am grateful
to you, Mitsuru.

372
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,783
I'm glad that
you were here.

373
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,751
Yeah?

374
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:51,818
But...

375
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,119
no more information for you!

376
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:54,387
[MITSURU]
Ahhhhh?!

377
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,656
Huuhh?!

378
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,257
Aw, come on!
Don't be like that!

379
00:15:57,357 --> 00:16:00,961
What about my in‐depth
article on you?! Soma, sir!

380
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:03,429
(Music plays)

381
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,259
[KOJIRO]
But still...
it seems a bit unseemly

382
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,228
for Tohtsuki Resorts'
Executive Chef

383
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,163
to personally go judge
something like this ...

384
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,332
I didn't know you had
that much free time, Dojima.

385
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,737
Haha... I have a vested interest
in nurturing these students.

386
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,371
I must answer the call of duty.

387
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,575
After all, I am but a poor chef
employed by Tohtsuki.

388
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,743
...Right?

389
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,044
[KOJIRO]
Quit holdin' a grudge

390
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,979
against something I said
when I was angry.

391
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,716
[GIN]
Words can hurt, Kojiro.
Words can hurt.

392
00:16:55,816 --> 00:17:00,220
Hm... Give my best to
Mizuhara and Inui okay.

393
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:04,157
(Music playing)

394
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,666
[MITSURU]
I wonder if he's all right?

395
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,668
It's about to start,
and he's still not here...

396
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,936
Where could he be?

397
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,470
Ah! Master Soma Sir!

398
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:19,506
Thank God you were able
to make it in time!

399
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:21,074
What the heck
were you doing?

400
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,876
[SOMA]
Sorry about that.

401
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:24,477
I had to do something.

402
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:25,912
So... did you‐uh...

403
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,551
did you come up with an idea to
beat Mimasaka's copycat cooking?

404
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,118
[SOMA]
Mmm... Dunno.

405
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,788
Huh?! What do you
mean you don't know?

406
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,790
I've done everything I can.

407
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,424
Now all that's left is...

408
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,227
just to have some fun
cooking out there.

409
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,634
Brother...

410
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,769
You doin' okay?

411
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:50,336
I was just talking to Soma.

412
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:53,006
He asked me to
give you a message:

413
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:56,442
"Be sure to watch my match."

414
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:57,511
(Loud cheering)

415
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,614
[URARA]
And now... Soma Yukihira!

416
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,983
The first bout of the
Fall Selection semifinals...

417
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,687
is once again being held as an
unprecedented official Food War.

418
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:11,157
A lot is at stake today,
as Soma has bet nothing less
than his career as a chef!

419
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,926
(Loud cheering)

420
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,829
Next up... is Subaru Mimasaka.

421
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,366
Will he come out firing
with another perfectly
recreated dish?

422
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,403
Now to introduce our judges,

423
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,606
five graduates of
the Tohtsuki Academy

424
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,942
and all former members
of The Council of Ten!

425
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,612
I'm Tohtsuki Resorts'
Executive Chef...

426
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,046
I'm Gin Dojima.

427
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,550
We shall judge firmly but fairly
on what we are presented today.

428
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,620
For this semifinal,
it's Soma Yukihira...

429
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,221
vs. Subaru Mimasaka.

430
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,258
Let the cooking begin!

431
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,229
(Gong rings)

432
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,865
(Loud cheering)

433
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,606
Hm! They're both presenting
a beef stew?

434
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,341
I don't care too much
for that big guy

435
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,577
who stuck his gum on
a cooking blade...

436
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,547
but that one with the headband
works in an eatery downtown?

437
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:10,651
He barely even transferred into
the Academy six months ago.

438
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:11,818
Not a chance.

439
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,419
I mean you agree with me right?

440
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,222
Yes. I think it would
be quite hard for him

441
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,658
to actually win here.

442
00:19:17,758 --> 00:19:20,160
[GIN]
That may very well
be true ladies.

443
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,162
It'll take a special
stew to win this.

444
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,465
I'm afraid an eatery's
concoction could be
way off the mark.

445
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,267
[ERINA]
<i>The allure of eatery fare...</i>

446
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,435
<i>It is said that the best</i>
<i>flavoring will allow the diner</i>

447
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,872
<i>to discover its true</i>
<i>glory by the third bite.</i>

448
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,608
<i>Until then, one doesn't know</i>
<i>exactly what they're eating.</i>

449
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:38,344
<i>If done well,</i>
<i>patrons can visit every day</i>
<i>and never grow tired of it.</i>

450
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,947
[GIN]
Whereas the flavors at
a high‐end restaurant

451
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,950
make one think a dish
is delicious from
the very first bite...

452
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,853
requiring a taste that is both
powerful and memorable.

453
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:50,991
[GIN]
Simply put, this inparticular,
calls for a "forceful" dish,

454
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,126
one that has
unforgettable impact.

455
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,628
[ERINA]
<i>And yet, Soma's beef stew</i>

456
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,997
<i>is far too gentle for</i>
<i>this level of competition.</i>

457
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,599
<i>And what's more absurd...</i>

458
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,001
<i>is the idea to retain the</i>
<i>mild taste of the white miso.</i>

459
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:04,705
<i>That only takes you</i>
<i>further away from the</i>
<i>intent of this challenge.</i>

460
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,508
<i>Today, Soma Yukihira</i>
<i>will surely show us...</i>

461
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,711
<i>a pitiful and embarrassing</i>
<i>loss to remember!</i>

462
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:11,845
(Gasp)

463
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:13,880
Look at that meat Soma's
started preparing...

464
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,516
It's oxtail!

465
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:16,249
(Gasp)

466
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,383
(All gasping)

467
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,520
Looks like he just turned it up.

468
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,388
It would seem Soma
has found his own answer.

469
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,426
[ERINA]
<i>Oh my god. I can see</i>
<i>your idea... your intent.</i>

470
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:30,296
<i>Oxtail is known to have</i>
<i>the most gelatin of</i>
<i>any part on the cow's body.</i>

471
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:35,769
[RYO]
<i>All he needs to do is add salt,</i>
<i>pepper, and flour to the</i>
<i>parboiled oxtail.</i>

472
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,740
<i>Sauté the surface to a golden</i>
<i>brown then let it simmer.</i>

473
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,177
<i>That way, it will impart</i>
<i>all that gelatin when</i>
<i>mixed with the demi‐glace.</i>

474
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,379
<i>and wreck the senses</i>
<i>into submission.</i>

475
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:51,051
[ERINA]
<i>The thickness of the gelatin</i>
<i>will bind itself to</i>
<i>demi‐glace or dashi stock,</i>

476
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,320
<i>adding depth of flavor</i>
<i>while retaining that</i>
<i>of the white miso.</i>

477
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,589
<i>That's smart.</i>

478
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,457
<i>That's the same method</i>
<i>Hisako used</i>

479
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:01,027
<i>for her soft‐shelled</i>
<i>tortoise burger.</i>

480
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,029
[AKIRA]
<i>The spice he added to</i>
<i>the meat was clove...</i>

481
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,199
<i>which has a sweet and</i>
<i>powerful flavor,</i>
<i>that's hard to beat.</i>

482
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,570
<i>Adding to that... clove is sure</i>
<i>to increase the mellowness</i>

483
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,905
<i>of the stew and</i>
<i>enhance its umami. Hm.</i>

484
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:15,441
[ERINA]
<i>Also... that vegetable</i>
<i>combination is a matignon.</i>

485
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:17,077
<i>Not a bad idea.</i>

486
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:18,545
Look there!

487
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,614
He's going to take minced
carrots, onions, and celery

488
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,716
and sauté them all in butter
until they're tender.

489
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,718
You can also simmer
in Madeira wine.

490
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,987
That technique can be used
in different dishes...

491
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:29,823
it helps to impart the
sweetness of the vegetables.

492
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,491
(Pan sizzles)

493
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:34,094
[ERINA]
<i>Uhh... That stew is going to</i>
<i>be even more delicious</i>

494
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:35,929
<i>than the one he</i>
<i>presented last week.</i>

495
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,632
[SOMA]
<i>What's needed here</i>
<i>isn't some gentle flavor</i>

496
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,334
<i>that you can just eat</i>
<i>bowl after bowl of.</i>

497
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,170
<i>Meat Meat's gift</i>
<i>ended up being a hint.</i>

498
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,372
<i>With this, I can make</i>
<i>a powerful stew,</i>

499
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,374
<i>one where meat plays</i>
<i>the starring role!</i>

500
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,512
You said I didn't
understand this theme...

501
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,814
You'll eat those words!

502
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,649
Erina Nakiri!

503
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:28,909
(Smug laugh)

504
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:33,980
Huh?

505
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:36,482
(Cackling laugh)

506
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,451
[MIMASAKA]
Everything you've
done this week...

507
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,954
what you've bought...
who you've met...

508
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:43,456
and what dishes
you've all tried out...

509
00:23:43,557 --> 00:23:45,692
I know about it all, Yukihira!

510
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,527
(Gasp)

511
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,729
Mimasaka too?!

512
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:50,597
Oxtail!

513
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,133
[AKIRA]
For spice... he's added
cloves and black pepper.

514
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,168
[MEGUMI]
He has a matignon too?!

515
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,436
It can't be!

516
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:57,971
[ZENJI]
They're the same.

517
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,875
He's following Soma's cooking
sequence to an absolute T!

518
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:05,145
Now... here's where
you fear me...

519
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,413
And I overtake you!

520
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,182
That‐that meat is...!

521
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,685
[MIMASAKA]
Here's my twist!

522
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,826
[NARRATOR]
Next time:
"Morning Shall Come Again"
