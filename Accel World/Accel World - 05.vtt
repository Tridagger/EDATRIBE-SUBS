WEBVTT

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:09.911
Both: BURST LINK!

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.545
DON’T LET ME BE TOO LATE!

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.178
( gasps )
NO WAY!

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:28.711
Haru: THAT’S TAKUMU?

00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.145
<i>HE’S</i> CYAN PILE?

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.545
( singing in Japanese )

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.500
I MUST SAY,
I’M QUITE SURPRISED

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.900
TO FIND OUT
<i>YOU’RE</i> A BURST LINKER.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.667
TAKU...
YOU KNOW...

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:14.567
I ALMOST LOST IT
BACK THERE YESTERDAY.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.267
HOW’D IT FEEL--
CABLE LINKING WITH CHI

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:19.100
ALONE IN HER BEDROOM?
( gasps )

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.967
DID YOU LIKE
BEING THAT CLOSE TO HER?

00:02:20.967 --> 00:02:23.733
TOUCHING HER?
KNOWING HOW THAT
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL?

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:26.767
SO YOU’RE THE ONE
WHO INSTALLED A VIRUS
IN HER NEURO-LINKER.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:30.733
SPYING ON HER, CHECKING HER
MEMORY AND VIEWER APPS
WHENEVER YOU WANTED!

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:34.400
WEREN’T YOU POKING AROUND
IN HER MEMORY, TOO?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.600
AND YOU’RE NOT EVEN
HER BOYFRIEND!

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.733
BUT HEY,
WHO GETS CHICKS, ANYWAY?

00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.600
YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,
SHE ALWAYS DID SEEM HAPPIER

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.700
TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU
THAN SHE EVER DID GOING OUT
WITH ME.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.167
IT’S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT,
AND I’VE HATED IT!

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.700
THAT’S WHY I WAS SO HAPPY
WHEN SHE FINALLY CHOSE ME.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.800
I MEAN, COME ON!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.667
I’M A KENDO CHAMPION
AND THE TOP STUDENT IN MY CLASS.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:03.533
<i>FINALLY,</i>
SHE MADE A WISE CHOICE.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.367
( gasps )
YOU JERK!

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:07.033
YOU DON’T HONESTLY MEAN THAT?!

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.067
HUH?
YOU’RE HER BOYFRIEND!

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:11.533
COULDN’T YOU TELL
THAT SHE WAS SUFFERING?!

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:13.133
YOU DIDN’T
EARN YOUR GOOD GRADES

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:15.600
OR THAT KENDO
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.167
ALL YOU DID WAS USE
<i>BRAIN BURST</i> AND ACCELERATE!

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.400
ACCELERATING <i>IS</i> MY POWER!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.767
( gasps )

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.933
I WAS INTRODUCED TO <i>BRAIN BURST</i>
A YEAR AGO

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:26.067
BY THE CAPTAIN
OF MY KENDO TEAM.

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:28.800
SHE’S A CLOSE AIDE
TO THE BLUE KING

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.367
AND THINKS I AM SUITED
TO BE A GUARD.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.367
THEY HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR ME.

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:37.133
NOW, DO YOU HONESTLY THINK

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:38.933
YOU AND I ARE EQUALS

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:42.000
JUST BECAUSE YOU’VE
BECOME A BURST LINKER, TOO?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.400
LOOK, IT’S TRUE--
YOU ARE WAY BETTER THAN ME

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.100
AT SO MANY THINGS.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.200
BUT YOU’RE ALSO
A COMPLETE MORON!

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.033
OH, AM I NOW?

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.967
THAT’S RIGHT.
AND THAT’S WHY YOU
CAN NEVER BEAT ME.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.367
NAME ONE GAME--
JUST ONE GAME

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.033
WHERE YOU’VE BEATEN ME!

00:03:57.033 --> 00:04:00.733
WELL, THEN...
THAT LAST SHRED OF DIGNITY
YOU’RE CLINGING TO--

00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:02.900
GET READY TO LOSE IT
FOR GOOD!

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:08.667
HE’S FAST, BUT STILL...
HE’S NOT AS FAST
AS ASH’S BIKE!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.233
I CAN DODGE HIM.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.800
( screams )

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.500
( grunting )

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:27.467
( laughing )

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.267
RUNNING AWAY ALREADY?

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:30.200
COWARD!

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:33.500
COME ON, OPEN!

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.567
( gasps )

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:40.967
( gasps )

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.333
( breathing heavily )

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.200
( laughing )

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:53.667
( gasps )

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:01.900
Haru: DID TAKU
CALL ALL THESE GUYS HERE
USING THE GLOBAL NET?

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:05.067
( elevator rumbling )
( gasps )

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:09.000
( thinking )
<i>I KNOW HOW FAST HE IS NOW.</i>

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.800
<i>I CAN DO THIS.</i>

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.533
<i>I CAN’T BACK DOWN.</i>

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.667
I HAVE TO BEAT HIM!

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.567
OH, I GET IT NOW.

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:27.167
YOU THINK YOUR LITTLE TACTIC
OF HIT-AND-RUN

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:28.433
IS GONNA WORK HERE?

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.433
HUH, HARU?

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.067
I MEAN, "SILVER CROW"?

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:36.533
<i>OKAY, HE STILL DOESN’T</i>
<i>KNOW HOW FAST I AM.</i>

00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:40.200
<i>AND BEFORE HE DOES,</i>
<i>I HAVE TO PUT AN END TO THIS.</i>

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:44.067
HERE GOES!

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:48.733
( Taku grunts )

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:55.633
( grunts )

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:57.367
WELL, HARU, I’M IMPRESSED.

00:05:57.367 --> 00:05:59.400
YOU REALLY ARE GOOD AT GAMES.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.267
BUT IF THAT’S
ALL YOU’VE GOT,

00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:02.933
IT’S NOT ENOUGH!

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:06.033
( grunts )

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:07.533
( groaning )

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.867
I’M NOT FINISHED YET!
( yells )

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.167
CHIYU DIDN’T CARE ABOUT YOU
HAVING TO BE PERFECT.

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:14.933
WHETHER YOU’RE
THE TOP OF YOUR CLASS
OR A KENDO CHAMPION,

00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:17.100
THAT’S NOT WHAT’S
IMPORTANT TO HER!

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.167
( groans )

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:23.567
SHE DIDN’T WANT YOU TO CHANGE!
SHE JUST WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY.

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:24.867
TO BE WHO YOU ARE.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:27.933
BUT YOU’RE TOO STUPID
TO SEE THAT!

00:06:27.933 --> 00:06:30.333
( groans )
THAT’S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU!

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.667
SPLASH STINGER!

00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:38.467
( gasping )

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.100
( groaning )

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:45.200
YOU WERE ABLE TO LAND
A FEW GOOD JABS ON ME.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.267
BUT ALL THAT REALLY DID
WAS GIVE ME THE TIME I NEEDED

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.067
TO CHARGE UP MY SPECIAL MOVE.

00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:53.667
AND AREN’T SPECIAL MOVES
WHAT DUELS ARE REALLY ABOUT?

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:57.500
OH, LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE
BIG ATTACK IS READY TO GO.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.733
LET’S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

00:06:58.733 --> 00:07:00.567
DAMN IT,
A HEAD-BUTT’S NO GOOD.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.400
IT’S NOT GONNA
HELP ME OUT HERE.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.800
BUT I’M NOT DONE YET.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.667
I’VE STILL GOT BOTH MY FEET
AND A FIST.

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:07.533
AND MY SPEED!

00:07:07.533 --> 00:07:09.067
( crumbling )

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.733
( gasping )

00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:17.700
( laughing )

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.133
YOUR LEG CAME OFF?

00:07:19.133 --> 00:07:20.733
HOW PATHETIC IS THAT?

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:22.767
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF
A METAL-TYPE?

00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:25.733
OH, NO. I’M FINISHED.

00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:27.667
I CAN’T EVADE.
I CAN’T DODGE.

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:29.200
I CAN’T DO ANYTHING!

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:32.567
THIS WAS INEVITABLE, HARU:

00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:35.667
YOU KNEELING BEFORE ME.

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:39.067
YOU KNOW, YOU SURE
HAD A LOT TO SAY EARLIER...

00:07:39.067 --> 00:07:43.533
AS IF SOMEHOW
YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO TRULY <i>GETS</i> CHI.

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:45.000
I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.533
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW HER
BETTER THAN YOU DO!

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.533
DIDN’T YOU EVER ONCE
THINK ABOUT ME?

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:51.667
SOMETIMES WHEN WE’RE ALONE,
I LOOK AT CHI,

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:53.400
AND SHE SEEMS TO SAD.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.200
AND THEN I REALIZED IT’S
BECAUSE SHE WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.200
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW THAT MAKES ME FEEL, HARU?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.667
( gasps )

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:05.200
YOU’RE A BURDEN TO US ALL.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.067
AND AS LONG AS YOU’RE AROUND,
CHI AND I CAN NEVER ESCAPE YOU.

00:08:09.067 --> 00:08:12.800
WE’LL BE STUCK DEALING WITH YOU
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.600
JUST DISAPPEAR, HARU.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.267
DISAPPEAR SO THAT CHI AND I
CAN FINALLY BE FREE!

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:20.200
( groans )

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.200
( groaning )

00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:37.100
ALL RIGHT, HARU.
LET’S END THIS...

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.767
ALL OF IT, NOW!

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:41.933
SPIRAL GRAVITY DRIVER!

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:46.933
( yelling )

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.700
( chuckles )

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.533
GUESS I DIDN’T
QUITE FINISH HIM.

00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:21.900
BUT IT DOESN’T MATTER.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.200
THE CLOCK’S ABOUT TO RUN OUT.

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:27.067
SO, DID YOU ALL
SEE THAT FOR YOURSELVES?

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.533
ESPECIALLY MY FRIENDS
IN THE BLUE LEGION?

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:33.300
I CAN STILL FIGHT,
STILL SERVE!

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.067
JUST BECAUSE I’VE
WASTED A FEW POINTS,

00:09:36.067 --> 00:09:38.267
THAT’S NO REASON
TO ABANDON ME.

00:09:38.267 --> 00:09:39.800
IS IT?!

00:09:46.193 --> 00:09:49.553
Taku: ...STILL SERVE!
JUST BECAUSE I’VE
WASTED A FEW POINTS,

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:51.353
THAT’S NO REASON
TO ABANDON ME.

00:09:51.353 --> 00:09:53.519
IS IT?!
TAKU...

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.253
TAKUMU.

00:09:55.253 --> 00:09:56.719
YOU IDIOT.

00:09:56.719 --> 00:09:57.919
( sobs )

00:09:57.919 --> 00:10:00.286
THIS IS A FIGHT
I HAD TO WIN...

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:01.653
FOR EVERYONE...

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:05.286
TAKU...CHIYU...EVEN MYSELF.

00:10:05.286 --> 00:10:06.253
( sobbing )

00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:09.519
AND ESPECIALLY
FOR KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI.

00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:10.853
( sobbing )

00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:13.453
BUT IT’S ALL OVER.

00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:14.953
I FAILED.

00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:20.853
( gasps )

00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:23.919
WHERE AM I?

00:10:29.953 --> 00:10:32.886
( labored breathing )

00:10:44.719 --> 00:10:47.086
SENPAI?

00:10:47.086 --> 00:10:48.653
( sobs )

00:10:50.553 --> 00:10:54.053
Haru: I’M SORRY...
I COULDN’T PROTECT YOU.

00:10:55.186 --> 00:10:58.419
I COULDN’T
MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

00:10:58.419 --> 00:11:00.386
I THOUGHT I COULD CHANGE.

00:11:00.386 --> 00:11:02.053
I REALLY DID.

00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:05.753
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME--
ALL OF YOUR KINDNESS AND LOVE,

00:11:05.753 --> 00:11:08.153
IT MADE ME
THINK I COULD DO IT.

00:11:08.153 --> 00:11:11.586
BUT IN THE END, I COULDN’T.

00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:14.486
IT’S ALL MY FAULT...

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:16.319
EVEN THIS AVATAR.

00:11:16.319 --> 00:11:19.353
IT’S JUST A REFLECTION
OF ALL MY PATHETIC WEAKNESSES.

00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:20.886
( sobs )

00:11:20.886 --> 00:11:24.119
ALWAYS LIVING MY LIFE
LOOKING DOWN AT THE GROUND
IN SHAME

00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:26.886
INSTEAD OF LOOKING UP
AT THE SKY WITH PRIDE.

00:11:26.886 --> 00:11:30.053
I WANTED TO GO WHERE YOU ARE

00:11:30.053 --> 00:11:34.186
AND BE WORTHY ENOUGH
TO JOIN YOU AND SEE YOU
SOARING THROUGH THE SKY...

00:11:34.186 --> 00:11:37.919
AS FAR WAY FROM THIS HELL
AS I COULD POSSIBLY BE.

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:42.586
I WANTED TO FLY AWAY...

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:44.386
WITH YOU.

00:11:45.486 --> 00:11:47.119
( sobs )

00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:50.453
( heart beating slowly )

00:11:50.453 --> 00:11:51.619
( gasps )

00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:53.986
( heart beating )

00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:56.286
( beating faster )

00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:00.486
( gasping )

00:12:00.486 --> 00:12:02.919
Kuroyukihime:
<i>YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT.</i>

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:06.653
<i>STRENGTH ISN’T SOLELY DEFINED</i>
<i>BY THE NUMBER OF VICTORIES</i>
<i>YOU HAVE WON.</i>

00:12:06.653 --> 00:12:08.086

00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:28.586
BUT STILL, IT’S A MYSTERY
AS TO WHO ACTUALLY
CREATED THE PROGRAM.

00:22:28.586 --> 00:22:30.686
CHANCES ARE THEY’RE
FROM THE YELLOW LEGION.

00:22:30.686 --> 00:22:32.986
THAT SORT OF PROGRAMMING
IS THEIR SPECIALTY.

00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:36.853
WHOEVER DID THIS WILL
PAY FOR WHAT THEY’VE DONE.

00:22:36.853 --> 00:22:37.953
( chuckling nervously )

00:22:37.953 --> 00:22:40.753
OH, I FORGOT.
HUH?

00:22:40.753 --> 00:22:42.986
HERE.
( gasps )

00:22:42.986 --> 00:22:45.719
I HAD THIS WITH ME.
I’M GIVING IT BACK.

00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:46.819
OH.

00:22:46.819 --> 00:22:48.686
SO, THEN.
DID YOU READ IT?

00:22:48.686 --> 00:22:51.419
UH, NO!
I MEAN, YES!
I MEAN--WELL...

00:22:52.653 --> 00:22:56.219
I’M SO SORRY,
KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI.

00:22:56.219 --> 00:22:58.219
ALL RIGHT, HARUYUKI.

00:22:59.353 --> 00:23:00.619
( coughs )

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:03.219
I BELIEVE THAT THE TIME
HAS COME.

00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.486
START CALLING ME
BY MY FIRST NAME.

00:23:05.486 --> 00:23:07.719
( gasps )
YEAH! OKAY!

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.986
( gasping )

00:23:09.986 --> 00:23:12.619
BUT, UH...
HUH?

00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:15.853
THAT’S GONNA BE HARD
BECAUSE...

00:23:15.853 --> 00:23:18.019
I’VE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

00:23:19.319 --> 00:23:20.753
YOU’RE KIDDING ME.

00:23:20.753 --> 00:23:22.786
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THAT
YOU READ THIS.

00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:24.519
NO, I JUST HAD A QUICK PEEK.

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:27.619
I DIDN’T REALLY SEE ANYTHING.
( chuckles )

00:23:27.619 --> 00:23:30.653
GLAD TO KNOW THAT YOU’RE
STILL THE SAME OLD HARUYUKI.

00:23:30.653 --> 00:23:31.919
WELL...

00:23:31.919 --> 00:23:34.953
I SUPPOSE I NEED
TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF, THEN.

00:23:34.953 --> 00:23:37.353
IT’S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT
FROM MY NICKNAME.

00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:41.086
