WEBVTT

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.140
GET UP, SILVER CROW!

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:13.507
I'LL DEAL WITH THIS ONE.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.340
YOU DEAL WITH YOUR ENEMY.

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:19.440
DEFEAT DUSK TAKER!

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:20.874
RIGHT!

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.240
(laughing)

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:30.740
YOU REALLY ARE
A NAUSEATING GROUP OF PEOPLE.

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:33.807
THIS WHOLE CHARADE ABOUT
THE BONDS OF FRIENDSHIP--

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.740
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU INTEND
TO KEEP BUYING THAT CRAP?

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:38.874
BECAUSE I'VE HAD IT!

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.174
I'M GOING TO SLOWLY
TORTURE EACH OF YOU,

00:00:43.307 --> 00:00:45.674
THEN WATCH YOU DIE...

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:48.074
JUST LIKE I DID TO HIM.

00:00:48.207 --> 00:00:50.440
(laughing)

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:53.874
SORRY, BUT...

00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:55.640
YOU'VE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE, NOMI.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:58.807
AW, IS THAT SO?
AND HOW'S THAT?

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.240
YOU'VE BEEN MISTAKEN
ABOUT EVERYTHING

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:02.974
FROM THE VERY
BEGINNING.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:05.574
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
ON YOUR FIRST DAY
AT SCHOOL

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.640
WAS CHALLENGE
ONE OF US--

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:09.540
ANY OF US--
TO A DUEL

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.807
AND THEN INTRODUCE
YOURSELF.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.774
IF YOU HAD DONE THAT,
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.607
THE ONE THING YOU
HAD ALWAYS WANTED--

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.807
AND THAT'S FRIENDSHIP.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.407
THE REAL WORLD
HAS LEFT SCARS
ON EACH OF US,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.807
AND THE DESIRE
TO HAVE FRIENDS

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.740
IS SOMETHING
WE ALL SHARE.

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:28.290
HOLD ON.
LET ME MAKE SURE

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.023
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:32.523
BECAUSE YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR ME, YOU WANT TO BE
MY FRIEND?

00:01:32.657 --> 00:01:36.657
YOU'RE GONNA WHAT--
REACH OUT AND TRY
AND SAVE ME?

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.257
NO. IT'S CLEAR
THAT YOU AND I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.157
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.323
SO COME ON,
SEIJI NOMI.

00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.123
LET'S FINISH THIS!

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:47.757
I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR
YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.023
YES, HARUYUKI ARITA,

00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:51.990
LET'S END THIS,
SHALL WE?

00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:53.523
BECAUSE THE ONLY
FLYING AVATAR

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:55.923
THIS WORLD TRULY NEEDS
IS ME!

00:01:56.057 --> 00:01:58.823
ARMOR UP!
GALE THRUSTER!

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:10.923
(screaming)

00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:16.823
AAAH! LASER SWORD!

00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:21.623
UHH!

00:02:22.523 --> 00:02:23.790
CREATE THE IMAGE.

00:02:23.923 --> 00:02:26.557
RECHARGE THE THRUSTER!

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.257
(grunting)

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.423
COME ON, VISUALIZE IT!

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:34.257
(screaming)

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.357
OH, NO, YOU DON'T!

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.290
NOW GO!

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.590
LASER SWORD!

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:52.690
AAAAH!

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.057
COME ON, PUSH IT!
JUST A LITTLE MORE!

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.557
ONE MORE PUSH...
AND I'VE GOT HIM!

00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:09.757
(gasping)

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:16.557
KEEP GOING, MR. CROW.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.590
THAT'S RIGHT,
DON'T GIVE UP.

00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:20.757
YOU'RE
ALMOST THERE.

00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:27.457
(bothscreaming)

00:03:32.123 --> 00:03:33.690
NO!

00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:38.623
ONE MORE STRIKE,
AND HE'LL BE FINISHED!

00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:40.023
CITRON...

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:41.690
( gasps)

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:46.157
(grunting)

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.657
CALL!

00:03:56.757 --> 00:03:59.423
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
CHIYU!

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:12.423
(grunting)

00:04:12.557 --> 00:04:15.723
HA HA! HER OBEDIENCE
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE,
RIGHT?

00:04:15.857 --> 00:04:18.323
THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE IN POWER.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:22.523
FRIENDS? FRIENDSHIP?
USELESS.

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:26.423
WHO NEEDS 'EM?!

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.323
HOW I'VE WAITED
FOR THIS MOMENT.

00:04:29.457 --> 00:04:32.223
NOW DIE, SILVER CROW!

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:41.157
(bothgasp)

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.690
MY WINGS!

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.190
(gasps)

00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:04.590
(crying)
WELCOME BACK.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.890
THANK YOU.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.857
HARUYUKI...

00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:24.423
THANK GOODNESS.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.357
IT WORKED.

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.257
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.490
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THIS DONE!

00:05:45.057 --> 00:05:48.990
FULL POWER!

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:51.890
( bothscreaming)

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.357
(shuddering)

00:06:20.723 --> 00:06:23.357
HOW--HOW DID YOU TAKE
MY WINGS?

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.757
Chiyuri: BECAUSE
AS IT TURNS OUT,

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.523
MY ABILITY ISN'T
ACTUALLY HEALING.

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:28.623
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:06:28.757 --> 00:06:30.757
IT ALWAYS DID SEEM
A LITTLE ODD TO ME.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.023
I MEAN, WHY DID MY AVATAR
COME WITH HEALING POWERS?

00:06:34.157 --> 00:06:36.390
BUT WHEN YOU FORCED ME
TO HEAL YOU FOR
THE FIRST TIME,

00:06:36.523 --> 00:06:38.123
I REALIZED SOMETHING,

00:06:38.257 --> 00:06:40.457
AND IT STARTED TO MAKE
A LOT MORE SENSE.

00:06:41.623 --> 00:06:43.757
SEE, NOT ONLY WERE
YOUR WOUNDS HEALED,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.690
BUT YOUR WEAPONS
WERE FULLY RESTORED
AS WELL, WHICH WAS ODD.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:50.557
THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME.
MY ABILITY ISN'T
HEALING AT ALL.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.390
IT'S ACTUALLY THE POWER
TO TURN BACK TIME.

00:06:53.523 --> 00:06:56.123
I KNEW IF I KEPT
USING IT,

00:06:56.257 --> 00:06:58.457
EVENTUALLY HARU WOULD
GET HIS WINGS BACK.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.190
I FIGURED I COULD GET TO
THE POINT IN THE TIMELINE

00:07:01.323 --> 00:07:03.223
BEFORE SILVER CROW
HAD HIS ABILITIES STOLEN

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:05.690
AND MAKE IT LIKE
NONE OF THIS EVER HAPPENED.

00:07:07.023 --> 00:07:09.590
THE ONLY REASON
I OBEYED YOU UP UNTIL NOW

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:11.657
WAS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL
OF MY SPECIAL MOVE

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.590
SO I COULD TURN BACK TIME
EVEN FURTHER.

00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:17.290
EVERYTHING I DID
WAS FOR THIS ONE
SINGLE CHANCE.

00:07:17.423 --> 00:07:19.290
I PLAYED YOU, NOMI.

00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:21.623
I WAS NEVER ON YOUR SIDE
TO BEGIN WITH.

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:27.123
(laughs)

00:07:27.257 --> 00:07:29.123
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:07:29.257 --> 00:07:31.457
YOU GUYS REALLY ARE
RIDICULOUS.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.557
EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF YOU MAKES ME SICK.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.557
I'M LEAVING.
AND ONCE I'M GONE,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.323
THE FIRST THING
I'M GONNA DO

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.490
IS LEAK YOUR REAL
IDENTITIES EVERYWHERE.

00:07:40.623 --> 00:07:43.190
LET SOMEONE ELSE
DEAL WITH YOU.

00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:45.223
VICE! COME ON,
HURRY UP!

00:07:45.357 --> 00:07:47.057
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.323
GIVE THE CURRENT SITUATION,
MR. TAKER,

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:51.223
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:07:51.357 --> 00:07:52.723
WELL, THEN DO
SOMETHING!

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:54.457
IF YOU DON'T, I'LL
SPILL EVERYTHING,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.057
ON BOTH THE
RESEARCH SOCIETY

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.757
AND THE BRAIN
IMPLANT CHIP!

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.290
I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

00:07:59.423 --> 00:08:02.123
ONCE BRAIN BURST
UNINSTALLS ITSELF,

00:08:02.257 --> 00:08:04.190
THE CHIP IS PROGRAMMED
TO SENSE THIS

00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.857
AND DISSOLVE INTO
YOUR CEREBROSPINAL FLUID.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.690
IT'S THIS LITTLE BIT
OF INSURANCE THAT
GUARANTEES A PAST PLAYER

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.623
WILL NEVER REVEAL ANYTHING
ABOUT BRAIN BURST
TO THE WORLD.

00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:16.057
BUT I'M SURE
YOU KNOW THAT.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.723
AND, AS SUCH,
I WILL BE GOING NOW.

00:08:18.857 --> 00:08:21.657
YOU SEE, I HAVE
NO PERSONAL GRUDGE
AGAINST ANY OF YOU,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.457
NOR AM I INTERESTED
IN LEARNING YOUR
REAL IDENTITIES.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.590
BUT MOST OF ALL,
I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON

00:08:27.723 --> 00:08:30.057
THAT MESSING WITH
THE BLACK KING
AND HER PEOPLE

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.157
IS A VERY UNWISE MOVE.

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.790
I BID YOU FAREWELL.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:45.490
HE GOT AWAY.

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:47.957
DAMN IT!

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.723
DAMN IT, DAMN IT!

00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:53.190
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS!

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:55.923
SOMEONE HELP ME!
ANYBODY!

00:08:56.057 --> 00:09:00.390
WHAT DO YOU WANT? POINTS?
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME!

00:09:00.523 --> 00:09:04.257
HARU, I THINK
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

00:09:05.557 --> 00:09:08.157
DAMN IT!NO!NO!

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.890
DON'T! I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE POINTS I HAVE!

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.690
AND IF YOU WANT,
I'LL EVEN JOIN YOUR LEGION!

00:09:18.823 --> 00:09:21.557
JUST PLEASE--OHH!

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.057
NO! PLEASE!

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.923
DON'T TAKE IT AWAY
FROM ME!

00:09:25.057 --> 00:09:26.457
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE
MY POWER!

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.223
MY ACCELERATION--NO!

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:34.023
NO! NO!

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.290
DON'T!

00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:37.690
(grunting)

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.923
AAAAAH!

00:10:14.457 --> 00:10:16.890
Kuroyukihime:
HARUYUKI...

00:10:18.923 --> 00:10:23.490
SENPAI. SENPAI, I--

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:25.690
(crying)

00:10:25.823 --> 00:10:29.323
YOU DID SPLENDIDLY.
WHEN I'M BACK IN TOKYO,

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:31.490
YOU CAN FILL ME IN
WITH ALL THE DETAILS.

00:10:31.623 --> 00:10:34.023
YOU DID WELL YOURSELF,
TAKUMU.

00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:35.857
SAME WITH YOU, KURASHIMA--

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.723
I MEAN...CHIYURI.

00:10:39.823 --> 00:10:41.357
(allsigh)

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.023
YOU HAVE MY HEARTFELT
GRATITUDE.

00:10:45.157 --> 00:10:46.823
IF YOU HADN'T
NOTIFIED ME,

00:10:46.957 --> 00:10:49.923
I WOULD'VE NEVER
BEEN ABLE TO
GET HERE IN TIME.

00:10:50.057 --> 00:10:52.257
HUH?
YOU TOLD HER?

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.723
WELL, YOU SEE,
I WAS WORRIED

00:10:54.857 --> 00:10:56.490
THAT YOU WERE BOTH
BEING SO STUBBORN

00:10:56.623 --> 00:10:58.457
THAT IT WAS GONNA
GET YOU KILLED.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.490
SO WHEN A SUDDEN-DEATH DUEL
WAS DECIDED,

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:03.290
I EMAILED SENPAI
AND TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

00:11:03.423 --> 00:11:04.990
HUH?!
HUH?!

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.290
SHE REPLIED SAYING THAT
AS SOON AS I COULD TELL HER

00:11:07.423 --> 00:11:08.723
THE EXACT TIME AND PLACE,

00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:10.423
SHE'D GET THERE
AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD.

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:12.523
I WAS JUST SITTING THERE
STRESSING OUT,

00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:16.090
UNTIL FINALLY I WAS ABLE
TO SEND HER THE DETAILS.

00:11:16.223 --> 00:11:19.690
I DIDN'T KNOW.
SORRY.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.090
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING!

00:11:23.223 --> 00:11:24.990
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU RODE 15 HOURS

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:26.657
TO COME AND HELP US.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.657
WHEN I SAW YOU
ABOVE THE ROOFTOPS,
I WAS SO HAPPY.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.757
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH THAT
MEANT TO ME.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.990
I MAY HAVE OVERDONE IT A BIT
ON MY ENTRANCE.

00:11:35.123 --> 00:11:36.690
THANKS, CHIYU.

00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:39.357
TAKU AND I WOULD'VE
DEFINITELY LOST
ON OUR OWN.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.257
I MEAN IT.
THANK YOU.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.923
(groans)

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:45.990
OH, JEEZ. ALL RIGHT.

00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:49.390
IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMEONE
NEEDS TO LOOK AFTER
THE TWO OF YOU,

00:11:49.523 --> 00:11:52.290
SO I GUESS I'LL BE
JOINING NEGA NEBULOUS, TOO.

00:11:52.423 --> 00:11:53.523
HUH?
HUH?

00:11:53.657 --> 00:11:55.357
THAT OKAY WITH YOU,
SENPAI?

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.690
OF COURSE.

00:12:00.657 --> 00:12:02.123
(laughs)

00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:04.423
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:08.357
LET'S ALL GET BACK
TO THE REAL WORLD.

00:12:16.154 --> 00:12:18.754
(allsigh)

00:12:20.532 --> 00:12:22.799
I WOULDN'T HAVE
EXPECTED YOU TO COME UP
WITH A PLAN LIKE THAT

00:12:22.932 --> 00:12:25.032
IN A MILLION YEARS.
YEAH, ME, NEITHER.

00:12:25.165 --> 00:12:27.365
IF YOU HAD JUST
TOLD US WHAT YOU WERE
DOING FROM THE START,

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.799
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN SO STRESSED.

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:32.465
I TOLD YOU GUYS--
IF MY PLAN WAS
GONNA WORK,

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:34.832
I ONLY HAD
ONE SHOT AT IT.

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:37.032
IF NOMI HAD PLANTED
SOME KIND OF LISTENING
DEVICE ON ME

00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:38.932
OR A VIDEO CAMERA,
I COULDN'T RISK IT.

00:12:39.065 --> 00:12:40.865
EVERYTHING WOULD'VE
BEEN ALL OVER.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.332
UH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.265
THAT YOU THOUGHT OF
ALL THESE DETAILS.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:46.465
ARE YOU
REALLY CHIYU?

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:48.799
HUH?! WHAT THE HECK
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?!

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:50.232
OH!

00:12:50.365 --> 00:12:52.999
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:56.332
(sobbing)

00:12:56.465 --> 00:12:58.932
TAKU, I DID
MY VERY BEST.

00:12:59.065 --> 00:13:01.565
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DIFFICULT
IT WAS,

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:03.699
BUT I NEVER QUIT.

00:13:03.832 --> 00:13:05.465
WE KNOW.

00:13:05.599 --> 00:13:09.832
AND WE'RE GRATEFUL
THAT YOU DIDN'T,
CHIYU. THANK YOU.

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:12.332
( sobbing )
I LOVE YOU, GUYS!

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:15.432
I LOVE YOU!I LOVE YOU!
CHIYU!

00:13:17.265 --> 00:13:19.665
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
YOU DID FOR ME
DURING THIS TRIP.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.765
I HAD A REALLY
GOOD TIME.

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.865
SEE YOU AT SCHOOL.
YEAH, SEE YA.

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:27.099
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO OPEN YOUR PRESENT
AND SEE WHAT IT IS.

00:13:27.232 --> 00:13:29.065
SAME HERE.

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:42.232
Haru:AND THEN SOMEHOW
I MANAGED TO BREAK FREE

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:43.932
FROM THE GRIP
BLACK VICE HAD ON ME.

00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:46.532
BUT BY THEN,
I WAS COMPLETELY SPENT.

00:13:46.665 --> 00:13:48.665
I THOUGHT, "THAT'S IT,
WE'RE DONE FOR."

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:51.232
THEN I LOOKED UP
AND YOU WERE THERE.

00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:52.865
I SEE. WELL,
I MUST BE HONEST--

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:54.665
WHEN YOU SUMMONED
THAT ENHANCED ARMAMENT

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:56.699
AND IT TURNED OUT
TO BE GALE THRUSTER,

00:13:56.832 --> 00:13:59.199
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
MY HEART WOULD STOP.

00:13:59.332 --> 00:14:00.799
OF ALL PEOPLE,
I NEVER DREAMED

00:14:00.932 --> 00:14:03.032
SHE WOULD TEACH YOU
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM.

00:14:03.165 --> 00:14:06.332
YEAH, I'M SORRY.
I GUESS THAT WAS
KIND OF SELFISH.

00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:08.099
I SHOULD'VE ASKED
YOUR PERMISSION FIRST.

00:14:08.232 --> 00:14:11.065
IT'S FINE. I DOUBT
I WOULD'VE BEEN
A GOOD TEACHER ANYWAY.

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:14.899
CHANCES ARE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
STRICT ENOUGH WITH YOU.

00:14:15.032 --> 00:14:17.565
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
THE THINGS SHE DID TO ME!

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:19.699
WE WERE AT THE VERY TOP
OF THE TOKYO TOWER,

00:14:19.832 --> 00:14:21.832
AND SHE JUST PUSHED ME OFF
WITHOUT A WARNING.

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:24.199
HA! THAT SOUNDS
JUST LIKE HER.

00:14:24.332 --> 00:14:25.999
HA HA HA!

00:14:30.932 --> 00:14:33.065
UM...HUH?

00:14:36.065 --> 00:14:37.565
UHH!

00:14:38.932 --> 00:14:40.399
S-S-S-SENPAI!

00:14:40.532 --> 00:14:42.332
I'VE WANTED TO DO THIS
FOR SO LONG--

00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:45.632
EVER SINCE I HEARD
YOU LOST YOUR WINGS,

00:14:45.765 --> 00:14:47.832
BUT STILL DID YOUR BEST
TO NOT GIVE UP,

00:14:47.965 --> 00:14:49.632
TO TRY AND FACE HIM
REGARDLESS.

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:51.432
I WANTED TO HOLD YOU
JUST LIKE THIS.

00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:54.499
I KNOW HOW HARD
IT MUST'VE BEEN.

00:14:54.632 --> 00:14:56.232
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:59.599
I WISH I COULD'VE BEEN
THERE BY YOUR SIDE
DURING IT ALL.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.699
I'M SO SORRY I WASN'T.

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:04.399
I FAILED YOU
AS A GUARDIAN.

00:15:04.532 --> 00:15:06.599
NO. I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SORRY...

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:08.899
FOR ALL THE WORRYING
I MUST'VE CAUSED YOU.

00:15:09.032 --> 00:15:11.799
I <i>WAS</i> WORRIED!
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
JUST HOW MUCH!

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:13.732
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW SCARED I WAS,

00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:16.665
NOT KNOWING
WHAT I WOULD DO
IF I LOST YOU.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:19.099
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
TERRIFYING!

00:15:19.232 --> 00:15:21.299
(groaning)

00:15:21.432 --> 00:15:26.632
OH, RIGHT. I STILL
HAVE A REWARD
TO GIVE YOU.

00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:29.499
YOU WON TODAY'S
TERRITORY BATTLE,
RIGHT?

00:15:29.632 --> 00:15:31.532
I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

00:15:31.665 --> 00:15:33.265
I SAID I'D GRANT YOU
ONE WISH,

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:36.532
JUST SO LONG AS YOU
PROTECTED SUGINAMI
WITH YOUR LIFE.

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:42.832
(thinking)
<i>SENPAI, I'M GOING</i>
<i>TO GET STRONGER--</i>

00:15:42.965 --> 00:15:45.099
<i>I PROMISE YOU--</i>
<i>SO THAT I CAN PROTECT YOU</i>

00:15:45.232 --> 00:15:47.732
<i>FROM ANY ENEMY</i>
<i>THAT CROSSES YOUR PATH.</i>

00:15:47.865 --> 00:15:49.932
<i>BUT UNTIL THEN,</i>
<i>STAY WITH ME,</i>

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:52.499
<i>KEEP WATCHING OVER ME</i>
<i>AND GUIDING ME--</i>

00:15:52.632 --> 00:15:56.232
<i>AS MY TEACHER,</i>
<i>MY LEGION MASTER AND...</i>

00:15:56.365 --> 00:15:57.932
<i>AS MY GUARDIAN.</i>

00:15:58.065 --> 00:16:00.499
JUST STAY BY MY SIDE.

00:16:00.632 --> 00:16:03.665
ALWAYS BE THERE,
NO MATTER WHAT.

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:08.565
SAY YES! THAT'S ALL I'M
ASKING FROM YOU, SENPAI.

00:16:10.032 --> 00:16:12.265
UH...ARE YOU--

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.765
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?!

00:16:13.899 --> 00:16:15.265
HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?!

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:17.465
HUH?

00:16:17.599 --> 00:16:20.832
AAH!N-N-NO!
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG!

00:16:20.965 --> 00:16:23.832
I D-DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT, I SWEAR!

00:16:27.265 --> 00:16:29.565
OKAY, THEN.

00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:37.932
I PROMISE YOU...

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:40.799
I'LL BE BY YOUR SIDE
NO MATTER WHAT...

00:16:40.932 --> 00:16:43.732
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:49.065
HIT ME, ARITA!
COME ON, DO IT!

00:16:49.199 --> 00:16:50.432
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE!

00:16:50.565 --> 00:16:52.132
THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

00:16:52.265 --> 00:16:54.199
PLUS, THERE ARE
SECURITY CAMERAS
EVERYWHERE.

00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:56.099
ARITA!
I'M SO, SO SORRY!

00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:58.765
IF YOU WANT TO HIT ME,
TOO, THAT'S FINE.
NO, I WANT YOU TO!

00:16:58.899 --> 00:17:01.399
NO, IT'S FINE!
JUST STOP!

00:17:01.532 --> 00:17:03.899
<i>THIS IS ALL SENPAI'S DOING!</i>

00:17:04.032 --> 00:17:06.865
<i>SHE HACKED INTO THE</i>
<i>LOST-AND-FOUND SITE AND ADDED</i>
<i>NOMI'S CAMERA TO THE LIST.</i>

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:09.299
<i>I MEAN, I'M GLAD THAT IT'S</i>
<i>CLEARED MY NAME AND ALL,</i>

00:17:09.432 --> 00:17:12.799
<i>BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD</i>
<i>LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS!</i>

00:17:21.232 --> 00:17:23.732
<i>NOMI.</i>

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.299
HEY, UH...NOMI.

00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:30.932
HMM? YES?

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:33.399
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:36.899
UM, IT'S...ME.
YOU KNOW--ARITA.

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:40.165
HARUYUKI ARITA.
REMEMBER?

00:17:40.299 --> 00:17:43.032
ARITA SENPAI?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:43.165 --> 00:17:45.565
WE PLAYED AN ONLINE GAME
TOGETHER, DIDN'T WE?

00:17:45.699 --> 00:17:48.165
UH, YEAH. EXACTLY.

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:51.699
HMM, LET'S SEE.
THAT GAME...

00:17:51.832 --> 00:17:53.965
WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF IT AGAIN?

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:55.132
(gasps)

00:17:55.265 --> 00:17:56.832
Niko:CRAZY, RIGHT?

00:17:56.965 --> 00:17:59.432
WHEN BRAIN BURST
DISAPPEARS,

00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:01.765
SO DO ALL THE MEMORIES
YOU HAVE THAT ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:03.865
THAT'S ONE OF
THE MAIN REASONS
THE ACCELERATED WORLD

00:18:03.999 --> 00:18:06.232
HAS BEEN ABLE TO HIDE
ITS EXISTENCE FOR SO LONG.

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:09.399
BUT HOW IS THAT
EVEN TECHNICALLY
POSSIBLE--

00:18:09.532 --> 00:18:12.332
AN APPLICATION
THAT'S ABLE TO REMOVE
A PERSON'S MEMORIES?

00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:14.832
BEATS ME.
BUT NOW YOU GUYS KNOW

00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:17.832
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.765
MEGUMI.

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:22.532
YOU ASK ME,
YOU JUST GOTTA FORGET
THE TECHNICAL STUFF

00:18:22.665 --> 00:18:25.032
AND ACCEPT THAT'S
THE WAY IT IS FOR NOW.

00:18:25.165 --> 00:18:27.099
YOU AGREE?
YEAH, BUT--

00:18:27.232 --> 00:18:29.399
NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

00:18:29.532 --> 00:18:31.365
TALKING ABOUT IS USELESS.

00:18:31.499 --> 00:18:33.632
THE ONLY WAY ANYONE CAN
REALLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN

00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:35.532
IS TO REACH LEVEL 10.

00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:38.032
THEN YOU CAN ASK THE CREATOR
OF BRAIN BURST YOURSELF.

00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:41.132
YEP, EXACTLY.

00:18:41.265 --> 00:18:42.899
WE'VE GOTTA REACH THE END.

00:18:43.032 --> 00:18:45.332
I MEAN, WE <i>ARE</i>
BURST LINKERS.

00:18:45.465 --> 00:18:48.265
OKAY, YOU GUYS
CAN FILL ME IN

00:18:48.399 --> 00:18:50.899
ON ALL THE JUICY DETAILS
NEXT TIME.

00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:52.499
BYE.

00:18:52.632 --> 00:18:54.499
WHOO-HOO!

00:18:54.632 --> 00:18:57.599
WHAT ABOUT CHI?
SHOULD WE TELL HER?

00:18:57.732 --> 00:19:00.599
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF SHE DOESN'T
KNOW THIS JUST YET.

00:19:00.732 --> 00:19:02.299
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:04.599
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA
GET GOING NOW.

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:10.965
ONE THING IS FOR SURE--

00:19:11.099 --> 00:19:13.665
EVEN IF I FORGET ABOUT
THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:15.799
I KNOW FOR A FACT,
HARUYUKI,

00:19:15.932 --> 00:19:18.265
THAT I WILL NEVER
FORGET YOU.

00:19:18.399 --> 00:19:19.965
I FEEL THE SAME.

00:19:20.099 --> 00:19:22.232
I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA
FORGET YOU, EITHER--

00:19:22.365 --> 00:19:24.032
EVEN IF I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:25.465
I BELIEVE YOU.

00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:28.132
WELL, THEN...
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:30.365
THIS CASE
IS FINALLY OVER.

00:19:30.499 --> 00:19:32.232
NOT QUITE.
HMM?

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:33.699
I MADE A PROMISE,

00:19:33.832 --> 00:19:36.132
AND I STILL NEED
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

00:19:36.265 --> 00:19:37.865
HUH?

00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:11.767
SO, UM...I HAVE
YOUR WINGS HERE.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.600
I'D LIKE TO GIVE
THEM BACK TO YOU.

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:15.700
THEN YOU'VE REGAINED
YOUR SILVER WINGS--

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:19.534
AND I GUESS, WITH THAT,
YOUR DREAMS AND HOPE.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.367
BURST LINK.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.867
THANK YOU FOR
RETURNING THEM.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.700
MR. CROW,
I HAVE NO DOUBT

00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:30.034
YOU WILL FLY TO HEIGHTS
I COULD NEVER IMAGINE.

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:32.634
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'LL BE ROOTING FOR YOU.

00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:34.734
BEST OF LUCK.

00:20:36.534 --> 00:20:38.267
HEY, UH--

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:53.700
<i>SENPAI.</i>

00:20:55.634 --> 00:20:57.700

COME BACK, FUKO, PLEASE!

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.034
I NEED YOU!
PLEASE COME BACK!

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.500

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.034
SACCHAN!

00:21:10.167 --> 00:21:11.900
FUKO!

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.734
Haru: <i>WE SPEND OUR LIVES</i>
<i>IN A SPACE</i>

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:22.200
<i>THAT LIES SOMEWHERE</i>

00:21:22.334 --> 00:21:24.934
