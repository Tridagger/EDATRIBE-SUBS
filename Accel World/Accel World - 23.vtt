00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.924
(doorbell rings )

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:11.224
TAKU! UH--

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:15.490
CHI-CHIYU.

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:19.324
(singing in Japanese )

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:51.643
NOMI TOLD ME
TO COME HERE.

00:01:51.776 --> 00:01:53.058
HE SAID I SHOULD
MEET YOU GUYS

00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:54.458
AND TELL YOU I PLAN
ON BETRAYING HIM

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.058
AS A WAY TO REGAIN
YOUR TRUST.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.691
AND THEN I WAS TO ASK

00:01:57.824 --> 00:02:00.291
IF I COULD COME TO
THE UNLIMITED FIELD
WITH YOU,

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:02.824
WHERE I COULD HEAL HIM
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:06.358
BUT THEN I FIGURED,
NO MATTER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU TWO,

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:08.324
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.791
SO I DECIDED
THE BEST THING
FOR ME TO DO

00:02:10.924 --> 00:02:13.891
WAS JUST
TELL THE TRUTH
AND BEG YOU GUYS.

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:15.458
HUH?BEG FOR WHAT?

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.358
BEG YOU GUYS...
TO TAKE ME WITH YOU!

00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:21.058
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
BUT I HAVE TO
BE THERE!

00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.158
IF YOU SAY NO,
I WON'T BLAME YOU.

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:26.024
BUT THAT STILL
WON'T STOP ME.

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:28.924
I'LL JUST GO TO
THE OTHER SIDE
AND WAIT FOR YOU...

00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:31.891
NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES--
MONTHS, YEARS!

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:35.658
YOU CAN'T...BE SERIOUS.

00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.591
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?
YOU'RE THE ONE

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:39.658
WHO USED TO SAY THAT
BRAIN BURST WAS JUST A GAME.

00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:42.291
SO WHY GO
TO SUCH EXTREMES NOW?

00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:46.724
OKAY, THEN.
WE'LL GO TOGETHER.

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:48.791
TAKU?

00:02:48.924 --> 00:02:52.358
LISTEN,
REMEMBER WHAT I DID
SIX MONTHS AGO?

00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:55.924
I ATTACKED OUR MASTER.
BUT THEN YOU FORGAVE ME.

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:57.324
YOU BELIEVED IN ME,

00:02:57.458 --> 00:02:59.391
AND I WILL NEVER
FORGET THAT MOMENT.

00:02:59.524 --> 00:03:02.424
SO I'M CHOOSING
TO BELIEVE IN CHI, TOO.

00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:09.191
THANK YOU, TAKKUN.

00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:18.724

00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:29.591
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS BEING TOO CAREFUL.

00:05:29.724 --> 00:05:31.558

THIS IS THE ITEM
THAT WILL TRANSFER

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:41.524
I LOOKED UP THE RULES

00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:43.958
ONCE YOU ACTUALLY
GO AND ACTIVATE IT.

00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:46.258

WITH ALL THE CHANGES
WE MADE TO THE
STARTING VENUE,

00:07:20.546 --> 00:07:21.779
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU

00:07:21.912 --> 00:07:23.146
TO NAIL
A SPECIFIC TIME.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.212
I HAVE TO ADMIT--
YOU GUYS--

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:27.612
YOU SIMPLY NEVER FAIL
TO AMUSE ME.

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:29.712
I'VE LEARNED THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS
BEING TOO CAREFUL

00:07:29.846 --> 00:07:31.579
WHEN IT COMES
TO DEALING WITH YOU.

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:34.979
WELL, APPARENTLY,
YOU DIDN'T LEARN THAT
WELL ENOUGH, DID YOU?

00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:38.246
YEAH, BUT THERE'S NO WAY
YOU COULD'VE BEEN HERE
THIS WHOLE TIME.

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:40.779
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN,
LIKE, MONTHS ON END.

00:07:40.912 --> 00:07:42.979
NO, OF COURSE HE WASN'T.

00:07:43.112 --> 00:07:46.346
YOU KNOW, MAYUZUMI SENPAI,
SOMETIMES YOU'RE HILARIOUS.

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:49.912
I ASSUME YOUR LITTLE FRIEND
HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE CHIP I HAVE?

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:52.579
THEY CALL IT THE B.I.C.--

00:07:52.712 --> 00:07:54.746
THE BRAIN IMPLANT CHIP.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.646
THERE'S A WAY
TO PROGRAM THE CHIP

00:07:56.779 --> 00:08:00.946
SO THAT ITS TERMINAL REACHES
DEEP INTO THE RECESSES
OF YOUR BRAIN.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.946
OF COURSE, THIS IS
VERY DANGEROUS,

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:05.146
AND A NORMAL PERSON
WOULD NEVER DO IT.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.879
BUT THAT GUY UP THERE
LIKES TO LIVE ON THE EDGE.

00:08:08.012 --> 00:08:10.112
HIS TERMINAL REACHES INTO
THE REGION OF HIS BRAIN

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:13.246
THAT CONTROLS
HIS INTERNAL CLOCK.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:16.546
IN REAL-WORLD TIME,
HE DOVE INTO THIS FIELD

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:19.012
AT 8:00 THIS EVENING.

00:08:19.146 --> 00:08:21.079
BUT DON'T BE FOOLED.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:23.612
HE'S BEEN WAITING HERE
FOR MONTHS ON END.

00:08:23.746 --> 00:08:25.146
WITH THE USE
OF HIS B.I.C.,

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:27.779
HE HAS COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER HIS ACCELERATION.

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:29.946
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.979
WHO CAN DECELERATE.

00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:34.912
WHAT? HE CAN--
DECELERATE?

00:08:35.946 --> 00:08:37.912
(sighs)

00:08:43.012 --> 00:08:47.312
YOU KNOW, MR. TAKER,
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOUR GENERAL CHATTINESS

00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:50.879
IS WHAT ALLOWED
THIS SITUATION TO ARISE?

00:08:51.012 --> 00:08:52.812
IN MY OPINION, NO.

00:08:52.946 --> 00:08:54.779
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK OF
SURPRISE ON THEIR FACES?

00:08:54.912 --> 00:08:58.479
PRETTY GREAT, RIGHT?
I BET THEY'VE EVEN LOST
THEIR WILL TO FIGHT.

00:08:58.612 --> 00:09:00.279
I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

00:09:00.412 --> 00:09:04.879
THE THIN ONE THERE
IS PUTTING UP QUITE A FIGHT.

00:09:05.012 --> 00:09:07.346
THAT'S JUST BECAUSE
HE'S A METAL COLOR.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.279
GIVE ME THREE MINUTES,
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE BLUE ONE.

00:09:10.412 --> 00:09:13.812
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
30 SECONDS SHOULD DO IT.

00:09:13.946 --> 00:09:15.979
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE EVERY INTENTION

00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:17.779
OF EARNING MY REWARD.

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:19.946
<i>30 SECONDS?</i>

00:09:20.079 --> 00:09:22.279
<i>YOU THINK IT'S</i>
<i>GONNA BE THAT EASY?</i>

00:09:22.412 --> 00:09:24.346

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:26.346
<i>WHERE'S MY VOICE?!</i>

00:09:26.479 --> 00:09:27.979
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU--

00:09:28.112 --> 00:09:29.646
MY MOVE LOCKS DOWN
YOUR VOICE

00:09:29.779 --> 00:09:31.246
AS WELL AS YOUR MOVEMENT.

00:09:31.379 --> 00:09:33.646
THAT MEANS YOUR VOICE COMMAND
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:36.312
SO BE A GOOD BOY
AND JUST WATCH.

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.612
(laughs)
WELL, NOW...

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.412
I SEE THAT YOU'VE
COME PREPARED.

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:46.279
THIS SHOULD AT LEAST
MAKE THINGS A LITTLE
MORE INTERESTING.

00:09:54.112 --> 00:09:56.746
TELL ME--DO YOU HAVE
A NAME FOR THAT MOVE?

00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:58.612
UGH. DO I LOOK
LIKE THE TYPE

00:09:58.746 --> 00:10:00.746
WHO NAMES STUFF
LIKE SOME STUPID GAMER?

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.979
DIDN'T THINK SO.
I JUST LIKE TO FIND OUT

00:10:03.112 --> 00:10:04.879
AS MUCH AS I CAN
ABOUT MY OPPONENT

00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:07.512
BEFORE I TEACH THEM
A LESSON THEY'LL
NEVER FORGET.

00:10:07.646 --> 00:10:09.079
HEH.

00:10:13.646 --> 00:10:15.812
AAAAH!

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:18.912
CYAN...

00:10:22.346 --> 00:10:24.746
BLADE!

00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:28.779
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

00:10:28.912 --> 00:10:30.979
HEH!I GET IT NOW.

00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:33.779
YOUR LOSS TO ME MUST'VE
REALLY STUNK BADLY...

00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:35.812
IF IT MOTIVATED YOU
TO INCARNATE

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:38.146
A RIDICULOUS SWORD
LIKE THAT.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.846
BUT FINE.

00:10:40.979 --> 00:10:43.012
IF IT'S A SWORDFIGHT
YOU WANT,

00:10:43.146 --> 00:10:45.312
THEN IT'S A SWORDFIGHT
YOU'LL GET.

00:10:49.712 --> 00:10:51.846
TAKU, STAY STRONG!

00:10:51.979 --> 00:10:54.146
YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE
IN YOURSELF!

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.246
(screaming)

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:04.379
WELL, NOW,
I'M MILDLY IMPRESSED.

00:11:04.512 --> 00:11:05.746
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.446
AS LONG AS WE'RE
FIGHTING FAIRLY,

00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:11.079
I'LL ALWAYS BE
STRONGER THAN YOU!

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.446
HA HA HA!
YOU CAN ACT TOUGH,

00:11:13.579 --> 00:11:14.946
BUT IT'S CLEARLY
JUST A FRONT.

00:11:15.079 --> 00:11:17.646

ONE FATAL FLAW!

00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:23.679

00:11:23.812 --> 00:11:25.279
AAH!
HA HA!

00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:27.512
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
AREN'T YOU GONNA
AT LEAST TRY

00:11:27.646 --> 00:11:29.879
AND PROTECT YOUR NECK,
SENPAI?

00:11:30.012 --> 00:11:33.112

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:54.379
ALL RIGHT, YOUR CHOICE.
IF YOU REALLY WANT ME

00:11:54.512 --> 00:11:57.346
TO SLASH A GAPING HOLE
IN YOUR WINDPIPE SO BADLY,

00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:01.312
THEN I GUESS
THE ONLY CHOICE I HAVE
IS TO FINISH YOU!

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:06.979
(grunting)

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:13.212
YOU'RE DONE NOW.
DEMONIC COMMANDEER!

00:12:14.479 --> 00:12:16.112
AAAH!

00:12:17.412 --> 00:12:18.879
UHH!

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:22.479
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:24.746
YOU'RE TOO GREEDY.

00:12:30.077 --> 00:12:33.277
SOMETHING ALWAYS
STRUCK ME AS ODD--

00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:34.811
THE FACT THAT YOU
DIDN'T JUST STEAL

00:12:34.944 --> 00:12:37.244
LIME BELL'S
HEALING ABILITY.

00:12:37.377 --> 00:12:39.277
BUT THE REASON
FOR THAT...

00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:41.511
IS BECAUSE
YOU'RE MAXED OUT.

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.511
THERE'S A LIMIT
TO THE NUMBER OF
ABILITIES

00:12:43.644 --> 00:12:46.277
YOUR DEMONIC
COMMANDEER CAN STEAL.

00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.411
AREN'T THERE?

00:12:48.544 --> 00:12:50.277
THE PERSON WHO
TAUGHT ME INCARNATION

00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:52.111
TAUGHT ME
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:12:52.244 --> 00:12:53.744
CYAN PILE'S
TRUE CAPABILITIES

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:56.244
LIE ENTIRELY WITHIN
ITS PILE DRIVER.

00:12:56.377 --> 00:12:57.944
YOU PROBABLY THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.577
YOU COULD EASILY
TAKE OUT,

00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.411
BUT YOU WERE
SADLY MISTAKEN.

00:13:01.544 --> 00:13:04.544
I SEE. SO THEN,
THAT LITTLE STICK OF YOURS

00:13:04.677 --> 00:13:07.211
MUST'VE BEEN MADE FROM
SOME PARTICULARLY PAINFUL

00:13:07.344 --> 00:13:09.011
AND PATHETIC MEMORIES.

00:13:09.144 --> 00:13:11.544
MY MEMORIES REALLY
AREN'T ALL THAT BAD,

00:13:11.677 --> 00:13:13.711
NOT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT
TO THE SCARS

00:13:13.844 --> 00:13:16.777
THAT PRODUCE AN AVATAR
LIKE YOURS, DUSK TAKER.

00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:21.144
YOU STEAL THINGS
BECAUSE INSIDE YOU,
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT.

00:13:21.277 --> 00:13:24.611
BUT I THINK THAT NOW
YOU MAY HAVE FINALLY
REALIZED

00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:26.344
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU TAKE--

00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:28.311
POWERS, FRIENDSHIP,
LOVE, EVEN HOPE--

00:13:28.444 --> 00:13:29.744
IT'S ALL POINTLESS...

00:13:29.877 --> 00:13:32.377
BECAUSE NOT ONE
OF THOSE THINGS

00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:35.277
WILL EVER TRULY
BELONG TO YOU!

00:13:38.444 --> 00:13:42.211
(laughing)

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:44.344
NOTHING LEFT INSIDE?

00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:47.311
THAT ISN'T ME.
THAT'S HIM.

00:13:47.444 --> 00:13:49.777
HE WAS TWICE MY SIZE,
WITH A MATCHING TEMPER,

00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:52.411
AND EVERY DAY, HE TOOK
MY TOYS AND MY MONEY.

00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:54.411
HE EVEN MANAGED
TO TAKE AWAY

00:13:54.544 --> 00:13:56.811
THE ONLY GIRL
I EVER MADE FRIENDS WITH!

00:13:56.944 --> 00:13:59.277
AND THAT BASTARD
WAS MY OLDER BROTHER!

00:13:59.411 --> 00:14:01.811
YOU LOOKED HIM UP,
DIDN'T YOU?

00:14:01.944 --> 00:14:04.677
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.
MY GUARDIAN WAS MY BROTHER.

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:07.344
HE INSTALLED BRAIN BURST
IN MY NEURO-LINKER

00:14:07.477 --> 00:14:09.677
AND THEN FORCED ME
TO EARN POINTS FOR HIM.

00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:13.544
AND I DID. I WORKED
LIKE A SLAVE FOR HIM.

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:17.044
IF I DIDN'T DO IT,
HE'D BEAT ME TO A PULP
IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:14:17.177 --> 00:14:19.411
HE TOOK EVERYTHING
FROM ME.

00:14:19.544 --> 00:14:22.111
NO MATTER WHAT I DID,
IT WAS NEVER ENOUGH!

00:14:22.244 --> 00:14:25.277
HE EVEN TOOK AWAY
MY SELF-RESPECT.

00:14:26.711 --> 00:14:28.644
BUT IT MADE REVENGE
EVEN SWEETER.

00:14:28.777 --> 00:14:31.844
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
I BUILT UP MY POINTS.

00:14:31.977 --> 00:14:34.477
IT TOOK FOREVER,
BUT EVENTUALLY MY AVATAR

00:14:34.611 --> 00:14:36.444
GOT ITS FIRST
SPECIAL MOVE.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:38.111
I GOT MY HANDS
ON A B.I.C.,

00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:39.944
FIGURED OUT
THE INCARNATE SYSTEM

00:14:40.077 --> 00:14:43.411
AND THEN TOOK BACK
EVERYTHING MY BROTHER
HAD STOLEN FROM ME.

00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:46.344
I AMBUSHED HIM
IN THE UNLIMITED FIELD,

00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:48.911
TOOK HIS ABILITIES,
AND THEN USED INCARNATION

00:14:49.044 --> 00:14:50.711
TO ANNIHILATE HIM.

00:14:50.844 --> 00:14:52.977
EACH TIME HE REVIVED,
I KILLED HIM AGAIN.

00:14:53.111 --> 00:14:56.777
I KEPT ON GOING!
I KILLED HIM OVER
AND OVER AGAIN!

00:14:56.911 --> 00:14:59.011
RIGHT BEFORE I WAS
GONNA FINISH HIM FOR GOOD

00:14:59.144 --> 00:15:00.644
AND TAKE HIS
BRAIN BURST FOREVER,

00:15:00.777 --> 00:15:04.277
I HEARD HIM BAWL
LIKE A BABY.
IT WAS HYSTERICAL.

00:15:04.411 --> 00:15:06.544
YOU KNOW, JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT MOMENT NOW

00:15:06.677 --> 00:15:08.511
STILL MAKES ME LAUGH.

00:15:08.644 --> 00:15:10.911
(laughing)

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.544
HE'S THE ONE WHO TRULY
HAS NOTHING LEFT!

00:15:15.677 --> 00:15:18.911
HE LOST BRAIN BURST
AND THE ABILITY
TO ACCELERATE.

00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.911
I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE
MISERABLE LIFE THAN HIS.

00:15:22.044 --> 00:15:25.677
I'M DIFFERENT.
I'M GONNA TAKE EVERYTHING,

00:15:25.811 --> 00:15:27.711
EVEN THESE DELUSIONS
OF FRIENDSHIP

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:30.277
AND UNBREAKABLE BONDS
YOU ALL BELIEVE IN.

00:15:30.411 --> 00:15:32.644
I'M TAKING
EVERY LAST BIT OF IT!

00:15:34.244 --> 00:15:35.611
AAAAH!

00:15:38.044 --> 00:15:39.744
CHI!

00:15:42.077 --> 00:15:45.611
NOMI! LIME BELL
ISN'T PART OF THIS
SUDDEN-DEATH MATCH.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:48.011
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER
AS A HOSTAGE!

00:15:48.144 --> 00:15:50.211
OH, BUT I BEG
TO DIFFER.

00:15:52.277 --> 00:15:54.344
AAAAH!

00:15:54.477 --> 00:15:57.311
YOU BASTARD!

00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:01.111
CAREFUL THERE.

00:16:01.244 --> 00:16:03.911
I REALLY WOULDN'T
TALK TO ME LIKE THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

00:16:04.044 --> 00:16:05.811
AW, POOR GIRL.

00:16:05.944 --> 00:16:08.177
SHE DIVES INTO
THE UNLIMITED FIELD
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:16:08.311 --> 00:16:10.111
WHERE THE PAIN
IS DOUBLED,

00:16:10.244 --> 00:16:12.844
AND LOOK WHAT SHE
HAS TO ENDURE.

00:16:12.977 --> 00:16:14.677
AAAAH!
STOP IT!

00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:17.011
UNLESS YOU HAVE
A LITTLE ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT,

00:16:17.144 --> 00:16:20.311
THIS IS GONNA KEEP ON GOING.

00:16:20.444 --> 00:16:21.611
STOP IT!

00:16:21.744 --> 00:16:23.977
PLEASE!

00:16:24.111 --> 00:16:25.377
LET HER GO.

00:16:25.511 --> 00:16:28.477
JUST QUIT HURTING CHI.

00:16:30.277 --> 00:16:31.611
AAAH!

00:16:33.244 --> 00:16:36.444
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR BELIEVING
IN YOUR FRIENDS.

00:16:36.577 --> 00:16:38.911
ACTUALLY, IT'S BECAUSE
YOU <i>PRETEND</i>

00:16:39.044 --> 00:16:40.444
TO BELIEVE
IN YOUR FRIENDS

00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:42.711
THAT YOU WILL NOW
LOSE EVERYTHING!

00:16:42.844 --> 00:16:43.877
TAKU!

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:48.811
ADMIT IT--IF YOU REALLY
TRUSTED EACH OTHER,

00:16:48.944 --> 00:16:52.544
YOU COULD'VE
FINISHED ME OFF
ALONG WITH HER!

00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:54.744
<i>YOU'RE WRONG.</i>
<i>YOU'RE WRONG.</i>

00:16:54.877 --> 00:16:56.411
<i>YOU'RE WRONG!</i>
<i>YOU'RE WRONG!</i>

00:16:56.544 --> 00:16:58.211
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!</i>

00:16:58.344 --> 00:17:01.544
<i>YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH</i>
<i>TAKU CARES ABOUT CHIYU.</i>

00:17:01.677 --> 00:17:04.877
<i>THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD!</i>

00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:07.877
<i>DAMN IT,</i>
<i>WHY CAN'T I MOVE?</i> <i>WHY?!</i>

00:17:08.011 --> 00:17:09.911
<i>I HAVE TO GO HELP THEM!</i>

00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:14.477
(screaming)

00:17:18.811 --> 00:17:21.111
<i>IS THIS WHERE</i>
<i>IT'S ALL GONNA END?</i>

00:17:21.244 --> 00:17:25.211
<i>MINE AND TAKU'S TIME</i>
<i>AS A BURST LINKER--</i>

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.844
<i>IS IT REALLY OVER NOW?</i>

00:17:35.877 --> 00:17:39.677
<i>IS THIS ZERO FILL?</i>
<i>IT HAS TO BE.</i>

00:17:39.811 --> 00:17:42.044
<i>WHEN YOU LOSE</i>
<i>ALL SENSE OF WILL,</i>

00:17:42.177 --> 00:17:44.844
<i>WHEN THE FLAME IN YOUR HEART</i>
<i>GOES DARK,</i>

00:17:44.977 --> 00:17:48.644
<i>YOUR AVATAR</i>
<i>BECAUSE NOTHING MORE</i>
<i>THAN A COLD LUMP.</i>

00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:52.477
<i>THIS IS IT.</i>
<i>THIS IS THE END.</i>

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:54.311
Silver Crow:
<i>ARE YOU POSITIVE?</i>

00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:56.377
<i>I CAN'T DO THIS.</i>

00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:59.344
<i>IS THAT YOUR ANSWER,</i>
<i>HARUYUKI ARITA?</i>

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:03.344
<i>BUT...I CAN'T EVEN</i>
<i>MOVE A FINGER.</i>

00:18:03.477 --> 00:18:05.944
<i>SO YOU'RE GOING</i>
<i>TO QUIT?</i>

00:18:06.077 --> 00:18:08.277
<i>JUST LIKE THAT? AFTER</i>
<i>ALL YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED</i>

00:18:08.411 --> 00:18:10.611
<i>THROUGH BRAIN BURST?</i>

00:18:11.877 --> 00:18:13.144
<i>WHAT?</i>

00:18:13.277 --> 00:18:15.477
<i>YOU'RE JUST</i>
<i>GOING TO GIVE UP?</i>

00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:26.844
<i>SENPAI?</i>

00:18:26.977 --> 00:18:31.144
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO
ACCELERATE EVEN FURTHER...

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.344
YOUNG MAN?

00:18:34.511 --> 00:18:37.211
(grunting)

00:18:44.444 --> 00:18:47.277
(screaming)

00:18:47.411 --> 00:18:48.644
HUH?

00:18:52.111 --> 00:18:54.211
(screaming)

00:18:56.711 --> 00:19:00.244
(screamingcontinues)

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:06.344
(gasps)

00:19:08.977 --> 00:19:11.844
YOU SERIOUSLY SHOULDN'T
SURPRISE ME LIKE THAT.

00:19:11.977 --> 00:19:13.444
LETTING YOUR PREY ESCAPE--

00:19:13.577 --> 00:19:15.411
YOU'RE STARTING
TO SLACK OFF.

00:19:15.544 --> 00:19:17.277
THAT'S UNCALLED FOR.

00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:19.711
I WAS GIVING IT MY ALL.

00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:22.611
YOU SHOULD BE COMMENDING
THAT BOY INSTEAD.

00:19:24.377 --> 00:19:26.011
IT LOOKS LIKE,
IN THE END,

00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.644
THIS FAITH YOU HAVE
IN FRIENDSHIP WAS
NEVER OF ANY USE.

00:19:28.777 --> 00:19:33.111
AND NOW IT'S TIME TO
SAY GOOD-BYE, CYAN PILE!

00:19:33.244 --> 00:19:34.544
TAKU!

00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.577
WHAT?NO!

00:19:50.811 --> 00:19:53.977
(allgasping)

00:19:59.177 --> 00:20:02.311
WHAT?NO WAY.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

00:20:02.444 --> 00:20:04.211
THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!

00:20:04.344 --> 00:20:07.577
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!
IT'S THE BLACK KING--
BLACK LOTUS.

00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:10.311
HOW THE HELL WERE YOU
EVEN ABLE TO GET HERE?

00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:12.777
SO YOU'RE DUSK TAKER?

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:15.377
CLEARLY YOU'VE STILL
GOT A LOT TO LEARN.

00:20:15.511 --> 00:20:17.644
THERE ARE WAYS TO FIGHT
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD

00:20:17.777 --> 00:20:20.311
THAT YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN DREAMT OF.

00:20:21.844 --> 00:20:23.744
SENPAI.

00:20:25.311 --> 00:20:28.744
(neighs)

00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:35.711
LET ME REMIND YOU
OF SOMETHING, DUSK TAKER.

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:38.944
UNLIKE NORMAL BATTLEFIELDS
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH,

00:20:39.077 --> 00:20:42.277
THE UNLIMITED NEUTRAL FIELD
LITERALLY HAS NO LIMITS.

00:20:42.411 --> 00:20:44.344
THEREFORE, IN THIS WORLD,

00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:46.911
BOTH TOKYO AND OKINAWA
ARE LINKED...

00:20:47.044 --> 00:20:50.344
WHICH MEANS I COULD SIMPLY
DIVE INTO THIS FIELD
FROM OKINAWA

00:20:50.477 --> 00:20:53.344
AND FLY HERE TO TOKYO.

00:20:53.477 --> 00:20:55.644
FIRST, I TAMED THAT
LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY,

00:20:55.777 --> 00:20:59.344
AND THEN I SPENT 15 HOURS
GETTING ALL THE WAY HERE.

00:20:59.477 --> 00:21:01.844
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD,
THAT ALL TRANSPIRED

00:21:01.977 --> 00:21:03.344
IN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE.

00:21:03.477 --> 00:21:08.518
YOU WHAT?
THAT IS INSANE!

00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:11.951
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD EVEN THINK OF DOING
SUCH A BIZARRE THING?

00:21:12.084 --> 00:21:14.384
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN BOTHER?!

00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:17.318
YOU THERE--
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
HMM?

00:21:17.451 --> 00:21:19.318
I AM BLACK VICE,

00:21:19.451 --> 00:21:22.318
VICE PRESIDENT
OF THE ACCELERATION
RESEARCH SOCIETY.

00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:25.784
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, BLACK KING.

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.551
SO THIS IS A SOCIETY,
NOT A LEGION?

00:21:28.684 --> 00:21:31.918
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A BURST LINKER
CALLED SULFUR POT?

00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:35.918
UH, I THINK THOSE
MIGHT'VE BEEN HIS REINS.

00:21:36.051 --> 00:21:38.651
HEH. NOW I HAVE
ANOTHER REASON TO
DESTROY YOU TWO.

00:21:38.784 --> 00:21:41.518
FOR EVERY BIT OF PAIN
YOU'VE CAUSED MY
LEGION MEMBERS,

00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:44.484
I'M GOING TO RETURN
YOU THE SAME AMOUNT
AND DOUBLE IT.

00:21:44.618 --> 00:21:47.684
ACTUALLY,
MAKE THAT TRIPLE!

00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:50.984
OH. THAT SOUND SCARY.

00:21:52.551 --> 00:21:54.251
LOOK OUT!
HMM?

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:01.018
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,

00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:03.084
PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS
DON'T WORK ON ME.
