00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:09.078
( laughing )

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.206
( laughing )

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:17.006
Senpai:
RIGHT, SHALL WE GO?

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:22.639
<i>OH WOW,</i>
<i>IS THIS FOR REAL?</i>

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:25.972
<i>SPENDING THE MORNING</i>
<i>WITH TWO SUPER CUTE GIRLS.</i>

00:00:25.972 --> 00:00:28.272
<i>IT’S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.</i>

00:00:28.272 --> 00:00:29.706
Niko:
HEY!

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.572
YOU’VE HAD THAT GOOFY SMIRK
ON YOUR FACE ALL MORNING.

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:34.339
YOU’D BETTER NOT BE
HAVING SOME CREEPY FANTASY.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.006
WELL? YA BIG PERV!

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:39.039
NO. IT’S NOTHING
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:44.906
I THINK WE’RE ALL CLEAR
ON TODAY’S MISSION.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:46.772
AND SINCE THE FINE DETAILS
ARE LEFT TO YOU,

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:50.072
I TRUST YOU’LL HAVE NO ISSUES
DETERMINING WHEN AND WHERE

00:00:50.072 --> 00:00:51.806
CHROME DISASTER WILL
APPEAR NEXT?

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:54.106
COURSE NOT.
UNDER CONTROL.
GOOD.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:56.206
THEN WE’LL BE GOING NOW.

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:57.972
SEE YA LATER.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:01:00.272
BYE.
YOU GUYS HAVE A NICE DAY.

00:01:00.272 --> 00:01:03.072
WAIT, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH ME?

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:06.572
IT’S SUPPOSED
TO BE CLOUDY ALL DAY.

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:08.806
I HOPE IT DOESN’T RAIN.

00:01:08.806 --> 00:01:10.439
YEAH, SO DO I.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.906
<i>WOW, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.</i>

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.406
<i>I’M WALKING TO SCHOOL</i>
<i>WITH SENPAI.</i>

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:24.706
HOLD STILL.

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.672
YOUR TIE’S A LITTLE CROOKED.

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:30.206
OH, WELL,
THANKS FOR FIXING IT.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:31.772
( sighing )

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:44.939
HMM?

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:56.906
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD
OH MY GOD, OH MY GOD!

00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:00.139
♪

00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:34.671
YOU SURE LIKE
LIVING DANGEROUSLY,
DON’T YA, HARU?

00:03:34.671 --> 00:03:37.371
NO! NOT AT ALL.
NOTHING COULD BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!

00:03:37.371 --> 00:03:40.238
BUT THANKS.
YOU REALLY DID SAVE
ME THIS MORNING.

00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:42.405
Haru: I’M PRETTY
SURE YOUR WORDS GOT
ME OFF THE HOOK.

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:46.838
SO, SHE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
SENPAI HAD TO STAY
AT HARU’S, SEE?

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.438
COME ON, NOT THAT
STUPID GAME AGAIN.

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:51.505
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
SO INTO THIS THING?

00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:54.671
AND I STILL DON’T GET WHAT
ACCELERATING REALLY MEANS.

00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.571
BUT I SHOWED YOU
THE OTHER DAY, REMEMBER?

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.805
HEY, I KNOW!

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.605
GET ME THAT
BRAIN BURST THINGY,

00:04:00.605 --> 00:04:02.938
AND INSTALL THE GAME
ON MY NEURO-LINKER.

00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:06.871
AND THEN THAT WAY,
I CAN BECOME
A BURST LINKER, TOO!

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.671
Taku: DO YOU GUYS THINK CHI
WAS SERIOUS?

00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:14.105
NO WAY, IT’D NEVER WORK.
CHIYU’S ALWAYS BEEN
BAD AT GAMES.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:16.405
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ON THIS, MASTER?

00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:17.871
HUH?

00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:20.938
ABOUT CHI.
DO YOU THINK THAT
SHE ACTUALLY HAS

00:04:20.938 --> 00:04:23.871
A CHANCE AT
BECOMING A BURST LINKER?
HMM.

00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:26.071
WELL, BEFORE WE CAN ANSWER
THAT, DO WE KNOW IF SHE

00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:27.838
EVEN MEETS
THE FIRST CONDITION?

00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.505
WHAT’S THAT?
OH, WAIT, ARE YOU
ASKING WHETHER OR NOT

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:31.705
CHIYU’S HAD
A NEURO-LINKER

00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:34.171
INSTALLED SINCE
THE DAY SHE WAS BORN?

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:35.671
EXACTLY.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.405
YEAH, I’M PRETTY SURE. I THINK
SHE MEETS THAT REQUIREMENT.

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:40.171
OKAY, THEN.

00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:42.271
WELL, WHEN IT COMES
TO THE SECOND CONDITION,

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.771
CEREBRAL REACTION SPEED,

00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:46.538
THERE REALLY AREN’T
ANY STRICT STANDARDS
TO BE MET.

00:04:46.538 --> 00:04:51.905
SOME WHO’VE BEEN BAD
AT VR GAMES CAN INSTALL
THE PROGRAM WITHOUT ISSUE.

00:04:51.905 --> 00:04:53.805
REALLY?
IS THAT TRUE?

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:57.205
YES. BECAUSE THE MECHANISM
USED TO OPERATE OUR
AVATARS IS IDENTICAL

00:04:57.205 --> 00:04:59.838
TO THE BRAIN CIRCUITRY
THAT CONTROLS OUR BODY.

00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:02.405
SO, WITH THAT SAID,
YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM

00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:03.671
A LITTLE MORE EXERCISE.

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.171
( groaning )

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.305
THOUGH I MUST SAY,
TRYING TO MAKE
SOMEONE A BURST LINKER

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:10.105
WHEN YOU’RE NOT SURE
THEY’RE TRULY SUITABLE,

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:13.405
IS A BIG GAMBLE
FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE.
HOW SO?

00:05:13.405 --> 00:05:16.971
THE ISSUE IS WITH THE CURRENT
BRAIN BURST COPY LICENSE.

00:05:16.971 --> 00:05:19.605
YOU SEE, AS IT STANDS,
THE POWER TO BE A GUARDIAN

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:23.505
CAN BE USED JUST ONCE,
REGARDLESS OF YOUR
PROTEGE’S SUCCESS.

00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:25.471
WHAT?
YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT ONCE?

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.771
YES, AND THIS IS WHY SUCH
A STRONG BOND IS DEVELOPED

00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:31.205
BETWEEN A GUARDIAN
AND THEIR PROTEGE.

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:32.438
SO, TAKUMU...

00:05:32.438 --> 00:05:34.005
UH, YES?

00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.205
IF THIS WORKS
ON KURASHIMA,
INSTALLING THE BRAIN

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:40.105
BURST PROGRAM,
AND YOU BECOME HER GUARDIAN
AND SHE YOUR PROTEGE.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:42.471
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WILL BECOME STRONGER.

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:44.271
THERE CAN BE
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.

00:05:44.271 --> 00:05:47.971
BUT KNOW THAT NOT ALL THESE NEW
DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE POSITIVE.

00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:51.271
THERE WILL ALSO BE ADVERSE
REACTIONS. REMEMBER THAT.

00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:53.571
I’LL DO MY BEST
TO KEEP THAT IN MIND.

00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:56.771
<i>I CAN’T BELIEVE IT, THAT ONE</i>
<i>CHANCE IS SO VALUABLE,</i>

00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.171
<i>AND SHE USED IT ON ME.</i>

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:00.871
<i>NOW THAT I THINK OF IT--</i>

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:03.438
IT LOOKS LIKE BREAK
TIME IS OVER NOW.
IN REGARDS TO

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:07.005
CHROME DISASTER,
WE’LL RESUME THIS
CONVERSATION LATER.

00:06:07.005 --> 00:06:08.338
SURE.

00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:10.605
<i>I WONDER WHO SENPAI’S</i>
<i>GUARDIAN IS?</i>

00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:15.238
HMM?

00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:22.205
<i>SENPAI, CAN WE TALK DURING</i>
<i>OUR NEXT BREAK?</i>

00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.371
SORRY, I’LL MAKE THIS SHORT.

00:06:29.371 --> 00:06:32.871
UM, YOU SEE, WELL,
THERE’S SOMETHING I’M A LITTLE

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.005
CURIOUS ABOUT,
AND I THOUGHT...

00:06:35.005 --> 00:06:37.338
WELL, I THOUGHT MAYBE IF
I JUST ASKED YOU THEN--

00:06:37.338 --> 00:06:42.871
LET ME GUESS, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO MY GUARDIAN IS?

00:06:42.871 --> 00:06:44.871
I’M SORRY,
BUT I CAN’T TELL YOU YET.

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.671
I DON’T WANT YOU COMING
IN CONTACT WITH THIS PERSON,

00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:49.705
NO MATTER HOW SLIM
THAT CHANCE MAY BE.

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:51.838
IT’S BECAUSE
I’M YOUR LEGION MASTER,

00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:53.905
AND A GIRL WHO CARES FOR YOU.

00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:56.405
IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN
PETTY JEALOUSY, BUT...

00:06:56.405 --> 00:06:57.971
SENPAI?

00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:01.205
THERE WAS A POINT IN TIME
WHEN I WAS INCREDIBLY CLOSE

00:07:01.205 --> 00:07:03.838
TO MY GUARDIAN.
SHE WAS THE VERY CENTER

00:07:03.838 --> 00:07:06.005
OF MY WORLD.
I BELIEVED SHE WOULD BRIGHTEN

00:07:06.005 --> 00:07:10.305
MY FUTURE AND KEEP THE DARK
AND COLD FOREVER AT BAY FROM ME.

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:11.971
THIS, I TRULY BELIEVED.

00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:15.371
THAT’S JUST LIKE HOW
I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.938
BUT AS IT TURNS OUT,
THAT WAS AN ILLUSION.

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:23.438
NOW, YOU COULD EVEN SAY THAT
THIS PERSON IS MY GREATEST

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:25.438
AND MOST DESPISED ENEMY.

00:07:25.438 --> 00:07:28.138
I’D LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN
TO FIGHT THIS PERSON

00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:31.271
AND SEVER HER LIMBS,
CLEAN OFF HER BODY.

00:07:31.271 --> 00:07:34.338
I’D SMILE AS SHE BEGGED
FOR HER LIFE...

00:07:34.338 --> 00:07:37.171
AND THEN I’D RUTHLESSLY
CUT OFF HER HEAD.

00:07:38.705 --> 00:07:41.171
BUT THAT DREAM WILL
NEVER COME TRUE.

00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:43.805
LOOK, HARUYUKI,
YOU MUST KNOW HOW DIFFERENT

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:46.938
THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE.
THERE’S A CRITICAL DISTINCTION

00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:49.071
BETWEEN A GUARDIAN
AND A PROTEGE, AND THAT OF YOUR

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.105
TYPICAL BURST LINKER.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

00:07:52.105 --> 00:07:53.738
WELL, UH...

00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:00.405
IS IT THAT WITH THE GUARDIAN
AND THE PROTEGE,

00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:03.538
THE TWO OF YOU KNOW EACH OTHER’S
REAL IDENTITIES?

00:08:03.538 --> 00:08:06.205
YES, EXACTLY.
AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT.

00:08:06.205 --> 00:08:09.238
YOU SEE, EVENTS IN
ACCELERATED WORLD CAN AFFECT

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:12.871
AND MAGNIFY EMOTIONS ELSEWHERE.
LIKE IN THE REAL WORLD.

00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:15.471
AND I DON’T JUST MEAN
LOVE AND AFFECTION,

00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:18.338
BUT FEELINGS OF ANGER
AND HATRED, TOO.

00:08:18.338 --> 00:08:21.138
SO, WHILE THE ALLIANCE BETWEEN
A GUARDIAN AND THEIR PROTEGE

00:08:21.138 --> 00:08:25.005
IS THE STRONGEST BOND IN ALL
OF THE ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:28.271
IT CAN ALSO TURN INTO
AN ENORMOUS CURSE.

00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:30.138
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:08:30.138 --> 00:08:32.838
EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO,
YOU COULDN’T FIGHT THEM.

00:08:32.838 --> 00:08:35.938
THE REAL WORLD IMPLICATIONS
ARE TOO BIG TO BE IGNORED.

00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:38.505
IF THAT’S NOT A CURSE,
THEN TELL ME WHAT IS.

00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:42.071
BURST LINKERS EXIST FOR THE SOLE
PURPOSE OF FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:44.305
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS
IN SPITE OF THAT FACT?

00:08:44.305 --> 00:08:47.571
EVEN IF THINGS GET LIKE
THAT FOR US, I PROMISE,

00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:49.338
I WILL NEVER FIGHT YOU.
EVER!

00:08:49.338 --> 00:08:51.905
IF WE GOT TO THAT POINT,
I WOULD UNINSTALL BRAIN BURST

00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:53.605
BEFORE TURNING AGAINST YOU!

00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:55.238
DON’T BE STUPID.
IF THINGS COME TO THAT--

00:08:55.238 --> 00:08:58.638
NO, I WON’T FIGHT YOU.
I MADE A PROMISE!

00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.771
WELL, I’LL TELL
YOU THIS, HARUYUKI.
NO MATTER WHAT

00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:09.338
THE FUTURE MAY HAVE
IN STORE FOR US,

00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:11.271
I’LL NEVER
REGRET CHOOSING YOU.

00:09:11.271 --> 00:09:13.271
SENPAI.

00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:16.571
Senpai: <i>TAKUMU AND I</i>
<i>WILL GO TO OUR HOMES</i>

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:19.771
<i>AND DROP OFF OUR STUFF BEFORE</i>
<i>HEADING OVER TO YOUR PLACE.</i>

00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.871
<i>THEN WE’LL BEGIN OUR MISSION.</i>

00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:27.905
Haru:
I’M HOME.

00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:30.505
HEY, THERE.
WELCOME BACK.

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:36.038
DON’T WORRY. CHROME DISASTER
HASN’T MADE HIS MOVE YET.

00:09:39.305 --> 00:09:41.838
WHAT’S UP?
OH, WELL, UH...

00:09:41.838 --> 00:09:43.738
JUST SPIT IT OUT.

00:09:43.738 --> 00:09:48.038
WELL, I WAS WONDERING.
DO YOU HATE KUROYUKIHIME SENPAI?

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:49.805
HUH? FOR WHAT?

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:53.038
’CAUSE OF WHAT SHE DID.
I MEAN, SHE WAS THE ONE

00:09:53.038 --> 00:09:55.138
WHO SLAYED
THE PREVIOUS RED KING.

00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:57.438
AND SHE HAS A HUGE BOUNTY
ON HER HEAD.

00:09:57.438 --> 00:09:59.938
OH, YEAH.
RIGHT, THAT STUFF.

00:09:59.938 --> 00:10:02.138
NO, I REALLY CAN’T SAY
THAT I HATE HER.

00:10:02.138 --> 00:10:04.238
IF ANYTHING,
I’M GRATEFUL TO HER.

00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:05.738
HUH?

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:07.571
I GOT TO BE THE RED KING
BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE.

00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:10.138
IF IT WASN’T FOR HER SLAYING
MY PREDECESSOR AND BREAKING UP

00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:12.271
MY LEGION, I WOULDN’T BE
SITTING HERE AS THE KING.

00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:14.471
BESIDES, I HARDLY KNEW
THE FIRST RED KING.

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:16.471
I NEVER EVEN HAD
A CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:18.438
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

00:10:18.438 --> 00:10:20.405
YEAH. AND PLUS...

00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:22.138
WHAT?

00:10:22.138 --> 00:10:24.805
LISTEN, YOU HAD BETTER
NOT GO AROUND BLABBING
THIS TO HER.

00:10:24.805 --> 00:10:26.205
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:27.605
YEAH. OKAY.

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:31.338
THE TRUTH IS, I THINK THAT CHICK
IS ACTUALLY PRETTY AWESOME.

00:10:31.338 --> 00:10:33.138
I RESPECT HER BRAVERY.

00:10:33.138 --> 00:10:34.938
YEAH? HOW’S THAT?

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.271
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING
SHE’S DONE.

00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:39.571
WHILE ME AND THE OTHER KINGS
ARE OUT THERE HALF-HEARTEDLY

00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:41.838
FIGHTING EACH OTHER,
OBEYING THIS STUPID

00:10:41.838 --> 00:10:44.038
NON-AGGRESSION TREATY,
SHE’S THE ONLY ONE WHO’S

00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:47.905
HAD THE NERVE TO DECLARE HER
TRUE GOAL, TO REACH LEVEL 10.

00:10:47.905 --> 00:10:50.905
THOUGH I BET OTHERS ARE SECRETLY
PLOTTING THE SAME THING,

00:10:50.905 --> 00:10:53.138
THEY’RE JUST NOT WILLING
TO ACT ON IT.

00:10:53.138 --> 00:10:54.938
SO, ARE YOU THEN?

00:10:54.938 --> 00:10:56.038
HUH?

00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:59.105
ARE YOU AIMING
FOR THAT, TOO?
FOR LEVEL 10?

00:10:59.105 --> 00:11:02.538
I DON’T KNOW YET.
BETWEEN ALL OF US KINGS,

00:11:02.538 --> 00:11:04.771
THERE’S A THEORY THAT
IF SOMEONE WERE TO BECOME

00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:07.405
A LEVEL 10 BURST LINKER,
WELL, THE RESULT MIGHT TURN OUT

00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.338
TO BE THAT IT WOULD BRING ABOUT
THE END TO THE ENTIRE GAME.

00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:13.905
THEN, BRAIN BURST WOULD
AUTOMATICALLY UNINSTALL ITSELF.

00:11:13.905 --> 00:11:16.471
MEANING EVERYONE WOULD
LOSE THE PROGRAM AT ONCE.

00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.171
WHAT? REALLY?

00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:21.171
I DON’T THINK ANYONE
KNOWS FOR SURE IF
IT’S TRUE OR NOT.

00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:24.571
BUT, TO BE HONEST,
I DON’T EVEN LIKE
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.905
THAT’S HOW ADDICTED I AM
TO THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:11:27.905 --> 00:11:31.171
BUT, YOU KNOW, THE FACT PEOPLE
ARE SO INTO THE GAME

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.371
SHOWS YOU HOW WARPED
THIS WORLD’S BECOME.

00:11:33.371 --> 00:11:36.405
CHROME DISASTER IS
A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT.

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:39.171
THE REASON CHERRY ROOK
GOT AHOLD OF THE ARMOR
OF CATASTROPHE

00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:40.971
IN THE FIRST PLACE
IS BECAUSE HE WAS
PUSHING TO GET

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.738
TO A HIGHER LEVEL
IN A WORLD THAT’S

00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:45.271
GROWN DORMANT FROM
THAT STUPID TREATY.

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.605
IF I WERE TO REALLY
COME CLEAN ABOUT IT,
THE TRUTH IS,

00:11:48.605 --> 00:11:53.538
IT’S MY FAULT.
I MADE HIM DO THIS.

00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:55.071
LOOK, NIKO...

00:11:55.071 --> 00:11:56.871
SHUT UP!
DON’T LOOK AT ME!

00:11:56.871 --> 00:11:59.838
GET AWAY! FORGET EVERYTHING
I JUST SAID! YOU GOT THAT?

00:11:59.838 --> 00:12:03.005
JUST FORGET IT!
IF YOU DON’T I WILL KILL YOU!

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:06.205
HEY! WHAT SORT OF PERVY,
FOOTSIE GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?

00:12:06.205 --> 00:12:08.305
LISTEN, NIKO,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

00:12:08.305 --> 00:12:09.838
HUH?

00:12:09.838 --> 00:12:12.571
NOT WANTING THE GAME
TO END IS NATURAL,
AND I TOTALLY GET

00:12:12.571 --> 00:12:15.871
THAT YOU WANT TO STAY
IN THE GAME WORLD AND
HOPE IT’LL GO ON FOREVER.

00:12:15.871 --> 00:12:19.171
BUT LISTEN, I KNOW THIS
FROM ALL THE GAMES

00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:21.371
I’VE PLAYED BEFORE
ON THE NET,

00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:23.271
Haru: <i>THERE’S NOTHING LONELIER</i>
<i>AND MORE SAD THAN THE FATE</i>

00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:26.071
<i>OF A GAME THAT NEVER</i>
<i>COMES TO AN END.</i>

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:29.471
<i>PLAYERS EVENTUALLY GET BORED</i>
<i>AND MOVE ONTO OTHER GAMES.</i>

00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.505
<i>AND THEN ONE DAY,</i>
<i>EVEN THE GAME’S NPC’S ARE GONE.</i>

00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:35.805
<i>YOU SUDDENLY REALIZE YOUR</i>
<i>FAVORITE WEAPONS DEALER</i>

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:38.271
<i>OR INNKEEPER</i>
<i>HAS DISAPPEARED FOREVER.</i>

00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:40.405
<i>I’VE EXPERIENCED THAT MOMENT</i>
<i>SO MANY TIMES,</i>

00:12:40.405 --> 00:12:42.071
<i>AND IT JUST MAKES ME CRY.</i>

00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:44.438
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU
SHOULD FINISH A GAME.

00:12:44.438 --> 00:12:45.971
EVERYTHING ABOUT
THAT IS WRONG.

00:12:45.971 --> 00:12:48.405
IF BRAIN BURST DOES HAVE
AN ENDING THEN THERE’S NO DOUBT

00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:51.205
IN MY MIND, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT WE SHOULD BE AIMING FOR.

00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:55.505
EVEN IF IN THE END IT MEANS
WE LOSE OUR ACCELERATION POWERS.

00:12:55.505 --> 00:12:57.838
IT’S DEFINITELY THE RIGHT THING
TO DO, I KNOW IT.

00:12:57.838 --> 00:12:59.505
IT’S WAY BETTER THAN
THE ALTERNATIVE:

00:12:59.505 --> 00:13:03.338
Haru: WATCHING THE WORLD WASTE
AWAY INTO SOME FORCED ENDING.

00:13:03.338 --> 00:13:05.105
THE RIGHT THING TO DO,
HUH?

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:08.038
IT’S ODD TO HEAR A BURST LINKER
USE WORDS LIKE THAT.

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.771
YOU’RE A STRANGE ONE.
I HAVE TO ADMIT,

00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:13.105
I’VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY
A TUBBY LITTLE WIMP LIKE YOU

00:13:13.105 --> 00:13:15.905
MANAGED TO CREATE THE ONLY
FLYING AVATAR IN THE GAME.

00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:18.605
BUT NOW I THINK I’M BEGINNING
TO SEE HOW THAT HAPPENED.

00:13:18.605 --> 00:13:20.705
BUT THAT SAID...

00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:23.538
HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN
TO KEEP STANDIN’
THERE FONDLING MY FOOT?

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:26.271
YA BIG PERV!

00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:28.205
( bell ringing )

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.656
Niko:
HE’S ON THE MOVE!

00:13:51.256 --> 00:13:54.156
CHERRY JUST BOARDED THE SEIBU
IKEBUKURO TRAIN LINE.

00:13:54.156 --> 00:13:57.623
IF HE FOLLOWS HIS USUAL ROUTE,
HE’LL BE HUNTING IN IKEBUKURO.

00:13:57.623 --> 00:14:00.790
UNDERSTOOD.
SO, HOW SHALL WE GET THERE?

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.456
DO WE TRAVEL THERE IN
THE VIRTUAL WORLD OR REAL?

00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:05.623
I SAY VIRTUAL.
WITH THE FOUR OF US,

00:14:05.623 --> 00:14:07.923
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID
RUNNING INTO AN ENEMY.

00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:09.856
YES, GOOD POINT.
WHAT ENEMIES?

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:12.656
HARUYUKI, WHEN YOU
REACHED LEVEL 4,
I TAUGHT YOU

00:14:12.656 --> 00:14:14.623
A VOICE COMMAND.
DO YOU STILL
REMEMBER IT?

00:14:14.623 --> 00:14:17.290
UH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT,
VERY WELL THEN.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.756
I THINK IT’S TIME
WE SHOW YOU THE TRUE
BATTLEGROUND FOR

00:14:19.756 --> 00:14:23.223
BURST LINKERS LIKE US.
YOU’LL NEED TO USE
TEN POINTS FOR THIS.

00:14:23.223 --> 00:14:24.623
I ASSUME THAT’S
NOT A PROBLEM?

00:14:24.623 --> 00:14:27.256
UH, NO. NOT IF IT’S
JUST GONNA BE 10 POINTS.

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:29.190
BUT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY A TRUE BATTLEGROUND?

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.390
IT’S EXACTLY AS IT SOUNDS.
THIS IS THE TRUE ESSENCE

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.590
OF WHAT WE CALL
THE ACCELERATED WORLD. LET’S GO.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.990
THE MISSION TO DESTROY THE FIFTH
CHROME DISASTER STARTS NOW.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.990
Computer:
<i>CONNECT TO THE GLOBAL NET?</i>

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.423
All:
UNLIMITED BURST!

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.923
WHERE ARE WE?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.523
WAIT, IS THIS
THE UNLIMITED
NEUTRAL FIELD?

00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:08.790
Senpai: IT IS. THIS IS
THE SAME PLACE WHERE WE

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:12.390
HUNTED DOWN THE PREVIOUS ARMOR
OF CATASTROPHE TWO YEARS AGO.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.190
BY THE WAY,
HAVE YOU NOTICED
ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.490
HUH? LIKE WHAT?

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.056
Haru: HEY!
THERE’S NO TIME LIMIT!

00:15:20.056 --> 00:15:25.823
THAT’S RIGHT. THAT’S WHY
THEY CALL IT UNLIMITED.
COOL.

00:15:25.823 --> 00:15:28.723
ONCE YOU’RE HERE,
IT’S POSSIBLE TO STAY FOREVER.

00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:32.723
OF COURSE, YOU HAVE TO BE LEVEL
FOUR OR HIGHER TO EVEN ENTER.

00:15:32.723 --> 00:15:36.523
WE HAVE ACCELERATED,
RIGHT?
YES, THAT’S CORRECT.

00:15:36.523 --> 00:15:40.790
SO, IF WE’RE TO SPEND AN ENTIRE
DAY HERE USING REAL WORLD TIME,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.690
IN THE ACCELERATED WORLD
THAT WOULD BE THREE YEARS.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.956
THAT’S AWESOME!
WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL
ME THIS SOONER, TAKU?

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:51.390
MAN, JUST THINK OF HOW
MUCH STUFF I CAN GET DONE
IF I STAYED IN THIS WORLD.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.556
IT’S BETTER IF YOU DON’T.

00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:54.590
HUH?

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.690
Senpai:
HE’S RIGHT. IF IT’S JUST

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.590
A FEW DAYS THEN AT WORSE
YOU MISS A FEW APPOINTMENTS.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.556
BUT IF YOU SPEND HALF A YEAR
HERE OR EVEN A MONTH,

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:04.956
YOU’LL COME BACK A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

00:16:04.956 --> 00:16:08.523
IT’S TO BE EXPECTED.
YOUR BODY WON’T HAVE AGED,

00:16:08.523 --> 00:16:10.890
BUT YOUR SOUL WILL MOST
DEFINITELY HAVE.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.256
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:16.390
LET’S STAY FOCUSED.
WE SHOULD GET MOVING.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.490
AT THE MOMENT WE ACCELERATED,
WE HAD TWO MINUTES IN REAL TIME

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.123
BEFORE CHERRY’S TRAIN WAS DUE TO
ARRIVE AT HIS STOP IN IKEBUKURO.

00:16:23.123 --> 00:16:25.656
WE STILL HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO GET THERE, BUT...

00:16:25.656 --> 00:16:27.290
YOU’RE RIGHT.
HUH?

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.356
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET TO IKEBUKURO?

00:16:29.356 --> 00:16:30.856
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON RUNNING THERE?

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:33.923
DON’T BE AN IDIOT!
WHY DO YOU THINK WE BROUGHT YOU

00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:35.890
WITH US IN THE FIRST PLACE?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.423
HUH?

00:16:37.423 --> 00:16:39.956
YOU’LL HOLD ME TIGHT
AND CARRY ME, WON’T YOU?

00:16:39.956 --> 00:16:41.656
WHAT?

00:16:41.656 --> 00:16:43.156
( gasps )

00:16:43.156 --> 00:16:45.323
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE JOKING.
IF HE’S HOLDING ANYONE,

00:16:45.323 --> 00:16:47.290
IT’LL BE ME.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, JUST LOOK

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.390
AT WHAT I HAVE FOR LIMBS.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.990
( gasps )

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:54.256
YOU, RAIN, CAN CATCH A RIDE
BY GRABBING AHOLD OF HIS LEGS.

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:56.790
FORGET THAT!
IT’S YOUR OWN FAULT
YOU HAVE SUCH

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.590
A HUGE DESIGN FLAW.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.956
YOU CAN CATCH UP
WITH US LATER BY TRAIN.
OH, VERY FUNNY.

00:17:01.956 --> 00:17:05.423
RIGHT. WELL HOW ABOUT THIS.
I CAN--

00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:08.756
NO ONE ASKED YOU,
FOUR-EYES!
THAT’S RIGHT, TEACH!

00:17:08.756 --> 00:17:10.956
( gasping )

00:17:10.956 --> 00:17:12.523
Taku:
I MISS CHI.

00:17:12.523 --> 00:17:15.790
YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN,
HARU.
TAKU!

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.423
SO, WHAT’S IT GONNA BE?

00:17:17.423 --> 00:17:21.623
YES, DO TELL US, SILVER CROW?

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:25.290
WELL, I GUESS I’LL
START BY CHARGING UP
MY SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE.

00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.223
Taku:
YOU OKAY, HARU?

00:17:30.223 --> 00:17:33.923
YEAH, I’M FINE.
I JUST CAN’T GO VERY FAST.

00:17:33.923 --> 00:17:35.856
HEY, LOTUS,
YOU HEARD HIM.

00:17:35.856 --> 00:17:38.956
WHY DON’T YOU DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND TAKE THE TRAIN INSTEAD.

00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:40.656
OH, REALLY?
BUT IF YOU TOOK THE TRAIN,

00:17:40.656 --> 00:17:42.356
YOU COULD GET THE KIDDIE FARE.

00:17:42.356 --> 00:17:45.490
PLEASE STOP, OKAY? I’M SCARED
WE’RE GOING TO FALL.

00:17:46.956 --> 00:17:51.256
Haru: AMAZING. IT JUST GOES ON
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE.

00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:55.123
SO, THIS IS WHAT THE ACCELERATED
WORLD REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

00:17:55.123 --> 00:17:57.223
AND IT EXISTS RIGHT NEXT
TO THE REAL WORLD.

00:17:57.223 --> 00:18:00.344
A PERMANENT PLACE,
NOT JUST A TEMPORARY STAGE.

00:18:03.325 --> 00:18:06.365
YES. THIS IS THE TRUE
BURST LINKER BATTLEFIELD.

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:08.498
IF YOU’RE AIMING
TO REACH LEVEL NINE,

00:18:08.498 --> 00:18:10.565
YOU TOO WILL HAVE
TO FIGHT ON THIS BATTLEFIELD

00:18:10.565 --> 00:18:15.498
SOMEDAY AND WIN. HOWEVER,
THAT TIME IS NOT YET HERE.

00:18:15.498 --> 00:18:17.298
( sighing )

00:18:17.298 --> 00:18:19.098
( distant screaming sound )

00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:20.865
WHAT’S THAT NOISE?

00:18:20.865 --> 00:18:22.465
Senpai:
OVER THERE, HARUYUKI.

00:18:22.465 --> 00:18:24.098
TAKE A LOOK.

00:18:24.098 --> 00:18:25.998
( screaming sound )

00:18:25.998 --> 00:18:27.532
Haru:
WHAT IS THAT?

00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:29.898
Senpai: IT’S THE ENEMY.
AN INHABITANT OF THIS WORLD

00:18:29.898 --> 00:18:32.265
WHICH IS CREATED
AND OPERATED BY THE SYSTEM.

00:18:32.265 --> 00:18:34.298
Haru:
BUT WHAT ARE THEY FOR?

00:18:34.298 --> 00:18:36.198
Senpai:
YOU’LL SEE.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.932
THE HUNT.
IT’S ABOUT TO START.

00:18:37.932 --> 00:18:39.898
Haru:
HUH?

00:18:52.098 --> 00:18:54.198
THAT’S THE HUNT?

00:18:54.198 --> 00:18:56.865
Senpai: YES.
Niko:
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:59.432
ASIDE FROM THE USUAL DUELS,
THE ENEMIES HERE ARE THE ONLY

00:18:59.432 --> 00:19:02.398
OTHER WAY TO EARN POINTS.
BUT THAT SAID,

00:19:02.398 --> 00:19:04.532
EVEN IF YOU DEFEAT
THESE HUGE MONSTERS,

00:19:04.532 --> 00:19:06.832
YOU’LL ONLY GET
ABOUT 10 BURST POINTS.

00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:08.965
WHAT? THAT’S ALL?

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:11.198
Senpai: IT’S BECAUSE THE HUNT
IS ONLY A MINOR COMPONENT

00:19:11.198 --> 00:19:14.632
OF BRAIN BURST, WHICH IS FIRST,
AND FOREMOST, A FIGHTING GAME.

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:17.398
HOWEVER, AS IT STANDS,
THE HUNT HAS BECOME ABOUT

00:19:17.398 --> 00:19:20.332
THE ONLY WAY FOR A PLAYER
TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVELS.

00:19:20.332 --> 00:19:22.965
RIGHT. THE NON-AGGRESSION
TREATY...

00:19:22.965 --> 00:19:27.365
BUT THERE ARE STILL OTHER WAYS
TO LEVEL UP, RIGHT, MASTER?

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:28.165
YES.

00:19:28.165 --> 00:19:29.998
Haru:
WELL, LIKE WHAT?

00:19:29.998 --> 00:19:32.365
Taku: LET’S JUST SAY THERE ARE
OTHER THINGS TO HUNT HERE

00:19:32.365 --> 00:19:34.798
BESIDES THE ENEMIES.
AND THE BEST PART

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:36.898
IS THEY’RE WORTH
A TON OF POINTS.

00:19:36.898 --> 00:19:42.065
I GET IT. IT’S NOT THE ENEMIES
BUT THE OTHER BURST LINKERS!

00:19:42.065 --> 00:19:44.065
Taku:
EXACTLY.

00:19:44.065 --> 00:19:47.232
HIGH-LEVEL BURST LINKERS
RARELY VENTURE OUTSIDE

00:19:47.232 --> 00:19:49.665
THEIR OWN TERRITORIES.
THIS IS ALL A RESULT

00:19:49.665 --> 00:19:52.565
OF THE NON-AGGRESSION TREATY.
BUT WHEN THEY DO LEAVE

00:19:52.565 --> 00:19:55.032
AND THEY COME HERE TO HUNT,
THEY CAN FIGHT ONE ANOTHER

00:19:55.032 --> 00:19:58.198
FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT.

00:19:58.198 --> 00:20:00.598
Niko:
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT
CHERRY ROOK,

00:20:00.598 --> 00:20:04.365
OR I GUESS I SHOULD
SAY CHROME DISASTER,
IS DOING HERE.

00:20:08.098 --> 00:20:10.098
WE’RE ALMOST AT IKEBUKURO.

00:20:10.098 --> 00:20:12.532
Senpai: YES,
BUT IT’S A VERY BIG PLACE.

00:20:12.532 --> 00:20:15.232
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT APPEAR?

00:20:15.232 --> 00:20:17.332
Niko: WELL, IF HE FOLLOWS
HIS USUAL ROUTE,

00:20:17.332 --> 00:20:19.565
IT’LL BE SOMEWHERE
AROUND SUNSHINE CITY.

00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:21.132
SO, LET’S START
FROM THERE--
LOOK OUT!

00:20:22.532 --> 00:20:24.898
Senpai: IS THAT HIM?
IS THAT CHROME DISASTER?

00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:27.365
CAN’T BE. I TIMED IT SO
WE’D GET HERE BEFORE HIM.

00:20:27.365 --> 00:20:29.565
AND PLUS, HE DOESN’T HAVE
LONG-RANGE ATTACKS!

00:20:29.565 --> 00:20:31.132
I’VE GOTTA LAND.

00:20:35.265 --> 00:20:37.932
Niko: THOSE MISSILES,
THEY’RE COMING BACK!

00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:44.532
SHIT!

00:20:46.532 --> 00:20:47.932
Haru:
( groaning )

00:20:57.998 --> 00:21:00.098
( screaming )

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:04.365
( grunting )

00:21:09.865 --> 00:21:11.598
EVERYONE OKAY?

00:21:11.598 --> 00:21:13.265
YEAH.

00:21:15.598 --> 00:21:17.398
THAT WAS CLOSE.

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:36.665
Taku:
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?

00:21:36.665 --> 00:21:40.832
Niko: I DON’T KNOW,
BUT I’M PRETTY SURE
THEY’RE NOT OUR FRIENDS.

00:21:46.132 --> 00:21:47.665
Haru:
A CLOWN?

00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:49.698
Niko:
YELLOW RADIO?

00:21:49.698 --> 00:21:51.432
Haru:
HUH?

00:21:51.432 --> 00:21:53.998
WHAT? WHY IS
THE YELLOW KING HERE?

00:21:53.998 --> 00:21:56.432
WAIT, HE’S A KING?

00:21:56.432 --> 00:21:58.132
IF HE’S THE LEADER
OF THE YELLOW LEGION,

00:21:58.132 --> 00:22:00.465
THEN HE’S A LEVEL NINE
BURST LINKER!

00:22:00.465 --> 00:22:03.265
BUT THE YELLOW LEGION’S
TERRITORY IS NOWHERE NEAR HERE.

00:22:03.265 --> 00:22:05.598
IT’S FROM UENO
TO AKIHABARA.

00:22:05.598 --> 00:22:08.732
SO, WHAT’S HE’S
DOING IN IKEBUKURO?
NOW, I GET IT.

00:22:08.732 --> 00:22:10.398
YA BASTARD!

00:22:10.398 --> 00:22:15.465
YOU SET THIS UP YELLOW RADIO.
THIS WAS ALL YOU!
