WEBVTT

00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:13.048
CRIMSON KINGBOLT: WELL, IT
ALL STARTED WITH MY PARENTS
SUDDENLY GETTING DIVORCED.

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:15.848
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
I ENDED UP IN OKINAWA.

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:19.448
I KNEW BEFORE I EVEN MOVED
HERE THAT FINDING A BURST LINKER
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE,

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:21.248
BUT I COULDN’T
FIND ONE ANYWHERE.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:23.681
AND THAT THREW ME
INTO A MAJOR FUNK.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.514
I SEE.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:29.048
WELL, C.K., I COMMEND YOU
FOR REMAINING A BURST LINKER
THROUGH ALL OF THIS.

00:00:29.048 --> 00:00:33.781
(LAUGHS) YEAH, WELL, MOST
OF IT WAS JUST ME LETTING
THINGS RUN THEIR NATURAL COURSE.

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.014
SEE, THIS KID HERE IS A
RELATIVE OF MINE, SO I ENDED
UP STAYING AT HER PLACE.

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:40.414
ONE DAY, I DECIDED
TO TAKE A GAMBLE.

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:43.848
I KNEW IF I COULD GET
A COPY OF THE PROGRAM
TO INSTALL IN RUKA,

00:00:43.848 --> 00:00:49.048
THEN I’D BE ABLE TO GIVE HER ALL
THE BURST POINTS I HAD AT THE
TIME AND GET HER UP TO LEVEL 4.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.948
IT WOULD SEEM
YOUR GAMBLE PAID OFF.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:55.548
YEP, AND THE TWO OF US
SCRAPED TOGETHER ENOUGH POINTS
AND ROLLED THE DICE AGAIN.

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:59.548
MIRACULOUSLY, WE WERE
ABLE TO INSTALL BRAIN
BURST INTO MANA AS WELL.

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:02.514
AND HERE WE ARE.
A HAPPY LITTLE TRIO.

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:05.381
I GUESS THIS MEANS
THAT HUNTING THE ENEMY

00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:07.581
IS A REAL LIFELINE
AROUND HERE.

WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:22.681

ABOUT, NEE-NEE.

LOTUS, I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR.

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.544
TAKE RUKA AND MANA BACK TO
THE HOTEL’S LEAVE POINT AND
GET OUT OF HERE WHILE YOU CAN.

00:03:21.544 --> 00:03:23.544
IS THAT
REALLY NECESSARY?

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:25.277
YEAH, I’M
AFRAID IT IS.

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:27.944
THIS ISN’T JUST SOME ORDINARY
ENEMY WE’RE GOIN’ UP AGAINST.

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.810
IT’S A LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.777
AND EVEN WORSE,
SOMEONE HAS
TAMED IT.

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.577
"TAMED" AN ENEMY?!
THAT’S UNHEARD OF!

SUCH A THING?

WHAT?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.644
WHOEVER IT IS, THEIR NAME
DOESN’T APPEAR ON
THE MATCHING LIST.

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:45.377
AND THAT’S WHY
WHOEVER’S RIDING IT
MUST BE A MAJIMUN TOO.

IF THE THREE OF YOU
ARE GOING TO ESCAPE,
YOU SHOULD DO IT NOW.

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:01.244
I’VE GOT A FEW
THINGS TO SAY
TO THIS MAJIMUN.

00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:05.310
AND BESIDES, RETREATING
WITHOUT CROSSING SWORDS
ISN’T MY STYLE.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.777
HEH. YOU HAVEN’T
CHANGED A BIT,
WORLD END.

00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:09.977

COUNT ME IN.

00:04:09.977 --> 00:04:12.177
LUCKY FOR US,
WE’RE INSIDE
THE WEATHERED STAGE,

00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:14.510
WHERE THERE’S A TON
OF SCRAP METAL
LYING AROUND.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.177
AND WITH THE BLACK KING
ON OUR SIDE,

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:19.044
WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE
OF WINNING AGAINST
THOSE MONSTERS.

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.210

THE OFFICIAL NAME FOR THIS
LEGEND-CLASS ENEMY IS NEEZHOG.

CALL HIM NICK.

00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:39.977
YOU THERE,
WHO ARE YOU?

00:04:39.977 --> 00:04:44.744
IT’S AGAINST OUR RULES TO
REVEAL OUR NAMES WITHOUT
ANY REAL PROVOCATION.

00:04:44.744 --> 00:04:49.710
BUT THAT SAID, IT’S NICE
TO MEET YOU, BLACK KING
AND THE THREE LOCALS.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.544
I AM SULFUR POT.
IT’S A PLEASURE TO
MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:58.044
THE BACK
DOOR PROGRAM.

00:04:58.044 --> 00:04:59.577

00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:01.077
DROP THE ACT.

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:03.377
THAT PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DISABLED WITH AN UPDATE.

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:07.577
BUT WHATEVER YOU’RE USING,
IT’S DESIGNED FOR CHEATING.
NOTHING ELSE.

00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:09.377
HMM? WHAT?

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:12.777
WHICH MEANS, YOU
PROBABLY AREN’T EVEN
IN OKINAWA RIGHT NOW.

00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:15.744
I BET YOU’RE DOING A REMOTE DIVE
FROM SOMEWHERE IN TOKYO.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.777
WELL, LOOK
AT YOU.

00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:28.377
EVEN THOUGH YOU’VE BEEN LYING
LOW FOR A FEW YEARS, YOU’RE
JUST AS SHARP AS EVER.

00:05:28.377 --> 00:05:30.344
GUESS I HAVE
NO CHOICE,
BLACK KING.

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:32.310
I’LL HAVE TO
FINISH YOU HERE.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.210
I CAN’T HAVE YOU DERAILING
OUR LITTLE FRONTIER
FARMING EXPERIMENT.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.944
THAT WOULD
REALLY SUCK.

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:39.777
WHAT THE HELL’S
HE TALKING ABOUT?!

00:05:39.777 --> 00:05:42.844
HE’S PROBABLY USING SOME
SORT OF CHEAT TOOL THAT
ALLOWS HIM TO CREATE

00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:47.144
A HUNTING A GROUND FOR
THE LOW-CLASS ENEMIES HERE
IN THE HENOKO AREA.

00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:51.377

BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY
TO THE BLUE KING.

00:05:57.277 --> 00:05:59.844
I’M GOING TO SLICE THAT
RIDE OF YOURS TO PIECES

00:05:59.844 --> 00:06:02.910

OF YOUR DEVIOUS LITTLE TRICKS.

00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:08.177
SUCH STRONG WORDS.

00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:11.510

FOR YOU WON’T BE ENOUGH.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.544

EVERY LIMB ON YOUR BODY!

MAXIMIZE THE FULL EXTENT OF
YOUR POWERS HERE, AM I RIGHT?

OH YEAH.
LISTEN UP!

DIG THROUGH THE RUBBLE FOR ANY
METAL OBJECT YOU CAN FIND,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.410
BRING IT TO THIS INTERSECTION
AND PILE IT ALL HERE.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.344
AW!
BUT WE WANNA
FIGHT TOO!

00:06:31.344 --> 00:06:33.077
YES, MASTER!

00:06:33.077 --> 00:06:36.344
WE’LL GATHER ALL THE
SCRAP METALS THERE IS.
JUST LEAVE IT TO US!

00:06:36.344 --> 00:06:38.310
CHIBARIYOO!

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.510
THE OUTCOME OF THIS BATTLE
WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH
METAL YOU CAN FIND.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.977
HERE IT COMES!

00:06:42.977 --> 00:06:44.444

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:50.210
CHEW ON THIS,
YA BASTARD!
TAPPING SCREW!

W-WHAT THE?

C.K.!

00:06:58.044 --> 00:06:59.110

A FEW FLYING SCREWS
ISN’T GOING TO STOP

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.977
A HEAVILY ARMORED
ENEMY LIKE THAT!

00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:05.144
HEY, CUT ME SOME
SLACK HERE, LOTUS.

00:07:05.144 --> 00:07:09.944
IT’S BEEN 3 YEARS
SINCE I’VE HAD TO
FIGHT IN A REAL BATTLE.

00:07:09.944 --> 00:07:14.810
COME ON, PUT ON A BETTER FIGHT,
OR I’LL JUST HAVE NICK TRAMPLE
YOU BOTH TO DEATH AND BE DONE!

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.644
I’D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY
AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

DID IT!

RUNNING AWAY?

YOU DIDN’T KNOW?

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.910
HIGH-LEVEL ENEMIES THAT HAVE
BEEN TAMED COME WITH THEIR
OWN SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.777
AND NOW HIS
IS FULLY CHARGED.

00:08:23.777 --> 00:08:27.277

YOU’RE DOING IS POINTLESS.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.777

00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:41.710
BEFORE THE CURRENT
RED KING CAME ALONG,

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.544
YOUR MASTER HAD THE GREATEST
LONG-RANGE FIREPOWER

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:47.177
IN THE HISTORY OF
THE ACCELERATED WORLD.

00:10:47.177 --> 00:10:50.177

YOU SON

00:10:57.377 --> 00:10:59.177
CHARCOAL SMOKE!

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:06.510

(LAUGHING)

00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:44.310
I HAVE TO SAY, I DIDN’T THINK
THIS FIGHT WAS GONNA FORCE ME
TO REVEAL THAT LITTLE TRICK.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.444
BUT IT’S NOT LIKE WE DIDN’T
TAKE SOME DAMAGE OURSELVES.

00:11:47.444 --> 00:11:50.777
AS YOU CAN SEE, NICK DID
EXACTLY AS HE WAS ORDERED.

00:11:50.777 --> 00:11:52.710
SO I HOPE YOU GET IT NOW.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.044
WE’VE CREATED
THE ULTIMATE PARTNERSHIP.

00:11:55.044 --> 00:12:00.177
THE TWO OF US WORKING
TOGETHER AS ONE.
WE ARE AN INVINCIBLE DUO.

00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:01.810
I WOULDN’T
BE SO SURE.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.144
I THINK THAT DRAGON
HAS SOMETHING HE’D
LIKE TO TELL YOU.

00:12:05.144 --> 00:12:07.644
(LAUGHS)
YOU’RE A KING,
ALL RIGHT.

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:10.044
YOU’RE A SORE LOSER
OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.

00:12:10.044 --> 00:12:15.544
I FEEL SLIGHTLY OBLIGATED TO
WARN YOU THAT NICK’S SPECIAL
MOVE GAUGE ISN’T QUITE EMPTY.

00:12:19.177 --> 00:12:22.110
MANA: IT’S OKAY.
DON’T WORRY.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.710
IT’S COMING.

00:12:39.752 --> 00:12:42.752
KUROYUKIHIME:
<i>THAT OTHER WORLD,</i>
<i>IT IS A PLACE I ESCAPE TO.</i>

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:47.186

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:49.152
MEGUMI: IF I
UNPLUG THIS...

00:12:49.152 --> 00:12:51.519
THEN HIME WILL
COME BACK TO ME.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:56.286
SHE’LL COME BACK TO A PLACE...
WHERE I CAN REACH HER.

00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:58.952
YOUNG MEGUMI:
NO, DON’T!

00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:05.986
THAT CABLE
IS THE DOORWAY.

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:10.419
IF YOU PUT IT ON, IT WILL
TAKE YOU TO THAT OTHER
WORLD FOR ONE LAST TIME.

00:13:10.419 --> 00:13:11.752
GO.

00:13:17.886 --> 00:13:19.152
(MEGUMI GASPS)

00:13:25.586 --> 00:13:27.619
UNLIMITED BURST.

00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:29.319
(SURPRISED GRUNT)

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:41.752
HELLO, HIME.
I’M HERE.

00:13:41.752 --> 00:13:45.386
THAT VOICE...
MEGUMI, IS THAT YOU?!

00:13:45.386 --> 00:13:48.552
I DON’T BELIEVE IT.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?

00:13:48.552 --> 00:13:53.986
WAS MEGUMI ONCE
A BURST LINKER, LONG
BEFORE WE EVEN MET?

00:13:53.986 --> 00:13:59.552
BUT THAT STILL DOESN’T EXPLAIN
HOW, OR EVEN WHY, SHE WAS
SUMMONED BACK INTO THIS WORLD.

00:13:59.552 --> 00:14:02.752
ANOTHER ONE?
HOW MANY MORE OF
YOU PESTS ARE THERE?!

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:06.819
ENOUGH!
I’M REDUCING YOU ALL
TO CINDERS RIGHT NOW!

00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:08.886
CHARCOAL STORM!

00:14:11.752 --> 00:14:13.619
(HORRIFIED GASP)
MEGUMI!

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:16.919
IT’S ALL RIGHT.
DON’T WORRY, HIME.
I’LL PROTECT YOU.

00:14:19.352 --> 00:14:23.519
PARADIGM REVOLUTION!

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.386
THAT AURORA.
IT CAN’T BE...

00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:34.119
A FORCED
TRANSITION...

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:37.486
GET ’EM, NICK!
BLOW ’EM ALL TO PIECES!

00:14:37.486 --> 00:14:39.252

(GASPING)
THE OCEAN STAGE?

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:56.252
HIME.
MY MAGICAL MOMENT
HERE IS NEARLY OVER.

00:14:56.252 --> 00:14:59.819
IT’S TIME FOR ME TO STOP
LIVING IN THE PAST, AND MOVE ON.

00:14:59.819 --> 00:15:01.219
SO PLEASE, HIME.

00:15:01.219 --> 00:15:03.752
LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY
YOU THINK IS BEST.

00:15:03.752 --> 00:15:06.419
I WILL.
THANK YOU, MEGUMI.

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:20.619
(SPUTTERING)
A LITTLE HELP, PEOPLE?

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:24.619
IN CASE YOU DIDN’T
NOTICE, I’M DROWNING HERE!

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:27.752
SORRY C.K., BUT YOU’RE
GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BIT.

00:15:27.752 --> 00:15:29.952
BY THE WAY, YOU DID
GREAT BACK THERE.

00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:32.852
NJI-MENSOORE,
MASTER!

00:15:32.852 --> 00:15:36.319
OKAY, DOLPHIN, MERROW,
WE’RE ON THE BRINK
OF VICTORY RIGHT NOW.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:40.786
LET’S FINISH THIS MISERABLE
CHEATER FOR GOOD BEFORE HE CAN
ESCAPE OFF TO SOME ISLAND.

00:15:40.786 --> 00:15:42.086
OKAY!

00:15:42.086 --> 00:15:43.286
HERE’S WHAT WE
NEED TO DO.

00:15:43.286 --> 00:15:45.386
I’LL ATTACK THE
DRAGON HEAD ON.

00:15:45.386 --> 00:15:48.019
WHILE I’M DOING THAT,
YOU TWO ATTACK
FROM THE SIDES.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:50.886
BE CAREFUL NOT
TO GET HIT.

00:15:50.886 --> 00:15:52.486
DON’T WORRY
ABOUT US, NEE-NEE.

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:54.319
WE’RE IN THE OCEAN NOW!

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:57.819
WHENEVER WE’RE IN
THE WATER, WE’RE
ALWAYS AT OUR BEST!

00:15:57.819 --> 00:15:59.652
BOTH:
READY, GO!

00:15:59.652 --> 00:16:03.286
SHAPE CHANGE!
MARINE MODE!

00:16:06.552 --> 00:16:07.819
ANNOYING LITTLE PESTS!

00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:14.586
(GASPS)
WHAT THE HELL?!

00:16:14.586 --> 00:16:17.219
(SCREAMING)

00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:20.486
NOW’S YOUR CHANCE!
CUT THE DRAGON’S REINS!

00:16:20.486 --> 00:16:23.252
ALL RIGHT.
LEAVE IT TO ME!

00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:26.852
DEATH BY PIERCING!

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:28.886
(BATTLE CRY)

00:16:37.152 --> 00:16:39.786
SULFUR POT:
THAT’S IT, NICK,
OVER HERE.

00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:42.252
NOW GO AND SWALLOW
THE LITTLE TWERPS WHOLE!

00:16:46.619 --> 00:16:48.419
WAIT.
WHAT’RE YOU DOING?

00:16:48.419 --> 00:16:50.152
NICK, I’M
YOUR MASTER.

00:16:50.152 --> 00:16:54.852
NO! NO, STOP IT!
NO! NO! NO!!

00:17:06.419 --> 00:17:09.019
THAT’S IT. GOOD JOB,
DOLPHIN AND MERROW.

00:17:09.019 --> 00:17:11.286
YOU FOUGHT
BRILLIANTLY.

00:17:11.286 --> 00:17:12.952
NEE-NEE.

00:17:12.952 --> 00:17:15.652
I’M GONNA
GET STRONGER.
I PROMISE.

00:17:15.652 --> 00:17:19.319
I’M GONNA PRACTICE
AND STUDY A WHOLE
LOT HARDER.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.352
AND THEN, SOMEDAY...

00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:23.486
I THINK THAT’S
AN EXCELLENT PLAN.

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:27.652
AND I’LL BE WAITING.
FOR WHEN WE MEET
AGAIN IN THIS WORLD.

00:17:27.652 --> 00:17:30.419
ME TOO!

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:34.152
WAIT A MINUTE.
I FEEL LIKE WE’RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING.

00:17:36.152 --> 00:17:40.086
GARGLING
STILL NEED A LITTLE HELP.

00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:44.186
WHATEVER.
IT’S FINE.

00:17:44.186 --> 00:17:47.752
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, I AM
JUST A CRUMMY OLD SCREW!

00:17:47.752 --> 00:17:50.486
SORRY, IT JUST TOTALLY
SLIPPED MY MIND.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:52.519
WASSAIBIIN,
MASTER.

00:17:52.519 --> 00:17:54.686
YOU’RE
ALL HEARTLESS!

00:17:54.686 --> 00:17:56.686
HMM?

00:17:56.686 --> 00:18:00.352
I THINK IT’S ABOUT TIME
FOR THE THREE OF YOU
TO START HEADING BACK.

00:18:00.352 --> 00:18:01.752
GIRLS:
OKAY.

00:18:01.752 --> 00:18:06.319
HEY, LOTUS.
BEFORE WE GO,
TAKE THIS.

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:08.852
I FOUND IT JUST
LYING THERE ON THE
FLOOR OF THE OCEAN.

00:18:08.852 --> 00:18:13.452
CONSIDER IT A LITTLE
TOKEN OF MY GRATITUDE.

00:18:13.452 --> 00:18:15.119
HMM?

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:18.419
AN ENHANCED ARMAMENT.
MYSTICAL REINS.

00:18:18.419 --> 00:18:20.352
I SEE.

00:18:20.352 --> 00:18:24.319
BUT...I DON’T THINK
I’LL HAVE ANY USE FOR IT.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:25.919
WELL, DON’T SAY THAT.

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:29.752
I HEAR THERE ARE SOME PRETTY
COOL ENEMIES IN THE NORTHERN
AREA OF OKINAWA.

00:18:29.752 --> 00:18:31.919
LIKE FLYING
HORSES AND STUFF.

00:18:31.919 --> 00:18:33.552
PLEASE,
TAKE IT.

00:18:33.552 --> 00:18:36.552
THERE WILL BE
A TIME WHEN YOU’LL
NEED IT. OKAY?

00:18:36.552 --> 00:18:38.352
A MESSAGE FROM YUTA?

00:18:38.352 --> 00:18:42.286
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I’LL ACCEPT.
THANK YOU.

00:18:42.286 --> 00:18:44.019
WELL, I’M OFF.

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:45.852
BUT TRY TO GO
EASY ON HIM.

00:18:45.852 --> 00:18:47.452
I’LL TRY.

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:54.486
NOW THEN, SULFUR POT.

00:18:54.486 --> 00:18:59.052
ONCE YOU REVIVE, I’M GOING
TO FORCE YOU TO COUGH UP
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.

00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:04.752
(CASUAL CHATTER)

00:19:04.752 --> 00:19:06.452
RUKA:
NEE-NEE!

00:19:06.452 --> 00:19:08.086
HMM?!

00:19:08.086 --> 00:19:09.919
OVER HERE!

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:12.586
COME TO UCHINAA
AGAIN, OKAY?!

00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.419
TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF!

00:19:16.986 --> 00:19:18.619
BOTH:
READY, GO!

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:21.719
GUBURII-SABIRA!

00:19:21.719 --> 00:19:23.152
(CHUCKLES)

00:19:32.786 --> 00:19:38.819
ONLY YOU COULD MAKE SUCH
CUTE FANS ON A SCHOOL
TRIP. WAY TO GO, HIME.

00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:41.286
I WOULDN’T QUITE
CALL THEM MY FANS.

00:19:41.286 --> 00:19:44.119
IT WAS ACTUALLY MORE OF
A CULTURAL EXCHANGE THING.

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:45.286
YEAH, SURE.

00:19:45.286 --> 00:19:46.919
THEN I GUESS I SHOULD GO AHEAD
AND WRITE THAT DOWN

00:19:46.919 --> 00:19:48.519
IN THE STUDENT
COUNCIL JOURNAL.

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:51.052
EH, WELL,
I WOULDN’T
DO THAT.

00:19:51.052 --> 00:19:52.819
(LAUGHS)

00:19:52.819 --> 00:19:56.952
HIME (voice over):
AFTER THAT FIGHT, MEGUMI
WOKE UP IN THE DIVE CAFE.

00:19:56.952 --> 00:19:59.286
BUT DIDN’T
REMEMBER
A THING.

00:19:59.286 --> 00:20:02.719
HER MEMORY ABOUT WHY
SHE HAD COME THERE,
BRAIN BURST...

00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:04.852
ALL OF IT, GONE.

00:20:04.852 --> 00:20:06.786
I’VE DECIDED TO
JUST LET IT BE.

00:20:06.786 --> 00:20:09.352
EVERYONE’S LIFE
HAS THEIR OWN STORY.

00:20:09.352 --> 00:20:16.352
IT’S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT
AT ONE TIME, MEGUMI HAD HER
OWN STORY IN THAT WORLD...

00:20:16.352 --> 00:20:19.419
AND THAT’S ALL
I REALLY NEED TO KNOW.

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:22.086
COMPUTER:
<i>INCOMING MAIL.</i>
<i>YOU’VE GOT MAIL.</i>

00:20:22.086 --> 00:20:25.419
CRIMSON KINGBOLT: I FOUND
IT IN THAT DIVE CAFE, JUST
LIKE YOU SAID IT WOULD BE.

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.686
IT’S A NEURO-LINKER THAT’S
BEEN ILLEGALLY MODIFIED

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:30.352
SO THAT SOMEONE COULD
LINK UP WITH WITHOUT
ACTUALLY WEARING IT.

00:20:30.352 --> 00:20:35.252
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEMORY HAD
A SELF-DESTRUCT TRIGGER, AND
THAT WAS ALL WE COULD FIND OUT.

00:20:35.252 --> 00:20:39.519
IF BRAIN BURST HAD BEEN
INSTALLED ON IT, ALONG WITH
SOME KIND OF BACK DOOR PROGRAM,

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:44.186
THEN, IN THEORY, THAT WOULD HAVE
MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SULFUR POT
TO PULL OFF WHAT HE DID.

00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:47.586
IF SOMEONE REALLY DID DO
THAT THOUGH, THEY’RE
SOME SERIOUS LOWLIFES.

00:20:47.586 --> 00:20:49.886
MAYBE THAT’S THE GROUP
HE WAS TALKIN’ ABOUT.

00:20:49.886 --> 00:20:51.586
HIME (voice over):
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:54.752
IN THE END, SULFUR POT DIDN’T
TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

00:20:54.752 --> 00:20:59.286
AND I’M SURE THE DAY WILL
COME WHEN THAT GROUP IS
SOMEONE WE’LL HAVE TO FIGHT.

00:20:59.286 --> 00:21:03.752
AND WHEN WE DO,
WE WILL CRUSH
THEM MERCILESSLY.

00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:05.219
HEY, WHAT’S
GOING ON, HIME?

00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:07.086
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU’RE HAVING FUN.

00:21:07.086 --> 00:21:08.719
OH.
I DO, DO I?

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:10.719
HEY, HIME...

00:21:10.719 --> 00:21:15.486
I THINK WHEN WE GET BACK
TO TOKYO, I’M GONNA WRITE
A STORY AND SET IT IN OKINAWA.

00:21:15.486 --> 00:21:18.019
IT’S ABOUT A DRAGON,
A MERMAID, AND THE SEA.

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:21.186
AND THE HERO WILL BE THIS
WARRIOR DRESSED ALL IN BLACK.

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:23.886
I HAD THIS CRAZY DREAM
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

00:21:23.886 --> 00:21:28.986
I LIKE IT. CAN I BE THE
FIRST PERSON TO READ
THIS STORY OF YOURS?

00:21:28.986 --> 00:21:32.552
OKAY, BUT BE READY.
I THINK IT’LL BE
ONE EPIC STORY.

00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:34.819
GREAT.
I’M LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:39.052
AND PLUS, I ALSO CAN’T
WAIT TO GET THE PRESENT
THAT YOU BOUGHT FOR ME.

00:21:39.052 --> 00:21:42.452
LET’S SEE NOW,
WHAT COULD IT BE?
HMM...

00:21:42.452 --> 00:21:45.519
IF I WERE TO USE PSYCHIC
INTUITION, I’D SAY...

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:47.086
(GASPS)
NO, DON’T, HIME!

00:21:47.086 --> 00:21:49.852
IF YOU SOMEHOW MANAGE TO GUESS
WHAT IT IS, YOU’LL SPOIL IT!

00:21:49.852 --> 00:21:52.786
HMM,
I SEE IT!
AND IT’S A...

00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:54.486
AW, COME ON,
I SAID STOP!

00:21:54.486 --> 00:21:57.652
IF YOU DON’T LET IT BE,
THEN IT’S MASSAGE TIME!
