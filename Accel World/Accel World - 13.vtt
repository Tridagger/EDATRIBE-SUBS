MIGHT HAVE NOTICED SOMETHING.

00:08:41.742 --> 00:08:43.809

THAT DOESN’T REALLY ADD UP.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:54.075
USUALLY A BURST LINKER
GOES TO THE SAME SCHOOL
AS THEIR GUARDIAN DOES.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.642
YEAH, BUT WE CAN’T BE SURE.

00:08:55.642 --> 00:08:57.609
I MEAN, THERE’S
ALWAYS THE EXCEPTION.

00:08:57.609 --> 00:09:00.342
YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK INTO IT.

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:02.875
NEW STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE
RECEIVED THEIR LOGIN ACCOUNTS.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:06.675

SHOULD START LOGGING ON
TO THE SCHOOL’S NET.

YOU TWO ARE BEING ALL

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.175
HUH?
LET ME GUESS.

00:09:16.175 --> 00:09:18.475
YOU GUYS WERE JUST ABOUT
TO GO INTO THE ACCELERATED

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.575
YEAH, WELL--
I TOLD YOU BOTH:

00:09:20.575 --> 00:09:23.209
I GOT INTO THIS
SO I COULD SHOW YOU GUYS

00:09:23.209 --> 00:09:25.509
HOW TO ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME
YOU’RE EACH SO INTO.

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:28.509
BUT IF WE DON’T ALL DO IT
TOGETHER, IT’S POINTLESS.

00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:29.775
CHIYU...

00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:31.842
YOU’RE SO RIGHT.

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:33.609
SORRY.

00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:35.509
HEY, LISTEN.
LET’S DO THIS:

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:37.475
TAKU, YOU LOG IN
AS A SPECTATOR.

00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:39.142
I’LL LOG IN
AND CHALLENGE CHIYU TO A DUEL.

00:09:39.142 --> 00:09:41.175
SINCE WE’LL ALL USE UP
ONE BURST POINT ANYWAY,

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:43.542
IT’LL BE A GOOD CHANCE
TO CHECK OUT WHAT HER DUEL
AVATAR’S LIKE.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:46.109
UM, OKAY THEN,
WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

00:09:46.109 --> 00:09:47.642
YOU JUST STAY PUT
FOR A SECOND.

00:09:47.642 --> 00:09:50.242
I’LL MAKE SURE TO CHALLENGE YOU
TO A DUEL STRAIGHT AWAY.

00:09:50.242 --> 00:09:52.642
LET’S DO IT.
HMM.

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:53.642
HMM.

00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:54.742
BURST LINK.

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:08.242
Chiyuri: WOW.

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:09.742
IS THIS ME?

00:10:12.909 --> 00:10:15.775
WHOA. SO THAT’S
YOUR DUEL AVATAR,

00:10:15.775 --> 00:10:16.742
HUH, CHIYU?

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:21.775
THE MATCHING LIST SAYS YOUR
NAME IS LIME BELL.

00:10:21.775 --> 00:10:23.475
LIME BELL?
I DON’T KNOW.

00:10:23.475 --> 00:10:25.342
IT LOOKS A LITTLE
TOO COLORFUL.

00:10:25.342 --> 00:10:27.309
AW, COME ON.
STOP COMPLAINING.

00:10:27.309 --> 00:10:30.109
IT’S REALLY RARE TO GET A COLOR
AS PURE AS THAT ONE.

00:10:30.109 --> 00:10:32.075
WAIT. IS THAT YOU, HARU?

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:33.509
UH, YEAH.

00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:36.809
SO...YOUR AVATAR’S
A REFLECTION OF THINGS

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:38.442
WHICH TRAUMATIZED YOU.

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:39.442
OH, I GET IT.

00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:41.375
WAIT! I KNOW WHAT
YOU’RE THINKING.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:42.809
JUST DON’T SAY IT.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:44.409
AND...IS THAT TAKKUN?

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:45.842
HE LOOKS REALLY STRONG.

00:10:45.842 --> 00:10:48.275
WAY BETTER THAN <i>YOU,</i> HARU.
( chuckles )

00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:50.775
UH, HARU, I CHECKED
AND IT DOESN’T LOOK LIKE

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.775
THERE ARE ANY BURST LINKERS
AMONG THE NEW STUDENTS.

00:10:52.775 --> 00:10:56.009
YOU’RE RIGHT. THE ONLY
NAMES ON THE LIST WERE...

00:10:56.009 --> 00:10:59.142
SILVER CROW, BLACK LOTUS,

00:10:59.142 --> 00:11:01.175
CYAN PILE,

00:11:01.175 --> 00:11:02.909
AND LIME BELL.

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:04.475
NO ONE ELSE.

00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:06.509
HEY, AREN’T ME AND HARU

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:09.775
SUPPOSED TO BE IN SOME KIND
OF DUEL RIGHT ABOUT NOW?

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:11.275
HOLD ON! NOT SO FAST!

00:11:11.275 --> 00:11:13.209
YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE RULES ARE YET.

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:14.875
TAKKUN GAVE ME THE BASICS.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.942
YOU WANNA GET AS MANY POINTS
AS YOU CAN BY WINNING TONS
OF FIGHTS.

00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:20.609
AND WHEN YOU GET TO LEVEL TEN,
YOU’VE CLEARED THE GAME, RIGHT?

00:11:20.609 --> 00:11:23.875
UH, WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT,
IT SUDDENLY SOUNDS SO SIMPLE.

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:26.809
HEY, AREN’T I SUPPOSED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF SPECIAL MOVE?

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:28.542
AH, GEEZ.

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:31.409
OKAY, YOU SEE THAT H.P. GAUGE
OVER THERE ON YOUR SCREEN?

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:33.342
THAT’S WHERE YOU CAN CHECK OUT
YOUR LIST OF SKILLS.

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:35.709
BUT YOUR SPECIAL MOVES
WON’T BE READY FOR--

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:37.075
AH, FOUND IT!

00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:40.609
OKAY. CITRON CALL!

00:11:41.675 --> 00:11:43.042
( ringing )
HUH?

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:45.509
YEAH. IT HELPS IF YOU LET ME
FINISH EXPLAINING.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:48.075
YOUR SPECIAL MOVE GAUGE
HAS TO BE FULLY CHARGED FIRST.

00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:51.542
IF YOU GET DAMAGED
OR INFLICT DAMAGE ON ONE
OF YOUR OPPONENTS...

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:52.642
OR...

00:11:52.642 --> 00:11:54.742
UH...EVEN IF YOU DESTROY

00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:57.009
ONE OF THOSE OBJECTS
OVER THERE.
REALLY?

00:11:57.009 --> 00:11:59.642
( giggles )

00:11:59.642 --> 00:12:01.142
( yelling )

00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:02.875
THIS FEELS AWESOME!

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:04.509
UH--SHE’S RUTHLESS.

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:07.475
ODD--HER H.P. GAUGE
ISN’T GOING DOWN.

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.175
IN THE FACTORY STAGE,
IF YOU DESTROY AN OBJECT,

00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:11.875
YOU SHOULD
TAKE SOME DAMAGE, AS WELL.

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:14.209
I GUESS SHE’S SUPER-RESILIENT.
TAKE THAT!

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:16.309
UH...CHIYU?

00:12:16.309 --> 00:12:18.475
( sighs )
WHAT?!

00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:20.442
( groans )
I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT

00:12:20.442 --> 00:12:22.509
THAT YOUR GAUGE IS FULL,
SO IT MIGHT WORK NOW.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.109
THAT’S ALL.
Chiyuri: WELL WHY
DIDN’T YOU SPEAK UP SOONER?

00:12:26.109 --> 00:12:28.075
ALL RIGHT THEN.
HERE GOES.

00:12:28.075 --> 00:12:31.342
CITRON...CALL!

00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:33.475
( gasps )

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.609
HUH?

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:38.209
WHAT THE HECK?!
NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:40.075
NO, THAT CAN’T BE RIGHT.

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:42.342
MAYBE IT ENCHANTS PEOPLE
OR SOMETHING.

00:12:42.342 --> 00:12:45.209
WELL IF THAT’S MY SPECIAL MOVE,
THEN IT’S TOTALLY LAME.

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:48.409
THIS SUCKS! LET ME HAVE ONE
OF YOUR SPECIAL MOVES, HARU.

00:12:48.409 --> 00:12:51.909
WHAT?! YOU’RE CRAZY!
NO WAY! I CAN’T DO THAT.

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:55.509
HER GAUGE HAS GONE DOWN
A WHOLE LOT IF IT’S JUST
SOME KIND OF ENCHANTMENT.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:57.342
BUT...HARU HASN’T
TAKEN DAMAGE

00:12:57.342 --> 00:12:59.109
OR GOTTEN WEAKER,

00:12:59.109 --> 00:13:00.809
WHICH MEANS--

00:13:00.809 --> 00:13:02.342
NO WAY!

00:13:02.342 --> 00:13:03.675
( grunting )
Taku: CHI!

00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:04.742
WHAT?!

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.209
TAKE THAT BELL
AND HIT HARU WITH IT.

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:08.242
( yells )

00:13:08.242 --> 00:13:09.242
OKAY. SURE.

00:13:09.242 --> 00:13:10.675
I WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT ANYWAY.

00:13:10.675 --> 00:13:11.742
WHAT?!

00:13:11.742 --> 00:13:13.109
( grunts )

00:13:13.109 --> 00:13:14.675
( yells, groans )

00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:16.009
EH...NOT ENOUGH.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:17.409
DO IT A COUPLE MORE TIMES.

00:13:17.409 --> 00:13:18.375
WHAT?!

00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:20.009
( voice breaking )
OH, COME ON!

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:21.675
( grunts )
( yells )

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:23.275
( groaning )

00:13:23.275 --> 00:13:24.475
( gasps )
( grunts )

00:13:24.475 --> 00:13:25.609
( screams )

00:13:25.609 --> 00:13:28.075
( gasps )

00:13:28.075 --> 00:13:29.575
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:33.309
CHI, TRY YOUR SPECIAL MOVE
ONE MORE TIME.

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:37.309
Chiyuri: ALL RIGHT.

00:13:38.809 --> 00:13:40.209
CITRON...

00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:42.209
( deep bell ringing )

00:13:44.542 --> 00:13:46.342
CALL!!!

00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:48.675
UH...

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:50.209
( screams )

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:52.675
IF MY GUESS
IS CORRECT, THEN...

00:13:52.675 --> 00:13:53.675
( groans, gasps )

00:13:53.675 --> 00:13:55.075
WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:58.942
MY H.P. GAUGE
IS FULLY RECOVERED.

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:01.075
IT’S JUST AS I THOUGHT.

00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:03.242
LIME BELL...

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:05.075
IS A HEALER!

00:14:05.075 --> 00:14:06.642
A HEALER?

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:08.842
THIS IS GONNA
CAUSE SOME MAJOR TROUBLE.

00:14:08.842 --> 00:14:10.442
HUH?

00:14:16.253 --> 00:14:19.935
Kuroyukihime: SHE’S A HEALER?
Haru: THAT’S RIGHT.
TAKU WAS JUST AS SURPRISED.

00:14:19.935 --> 00:14:23.057
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT TO TELL
ANYONE BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT’LL CAUSE AN UPROAR.

00:14:23.057 --> 00:14:25.390
THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT
IT’S GOING TO DO.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.823
IF WORD OF THIS GETS OUT,
BURST LINKERS
FROM ALL OVER TOKYO

00:14:28.823 --> 00:14:30.323
WILL START
OVERFLOWING SUGINAMI.

00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:32.990
AND BEFORE LONG,
A SCOUTING BATTLE WILL BEGIN.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.823
ARE HEALERS
REALLY THAT AMAZING?

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:35.990
WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL?

00:14:37.323 --> 00:14:40.257
IN THE SEVEN YEARS
ACCELERATED WORLD HAS EXISTED,

00:14:40.257 --> 00:14:43.357
THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IT’S
SEEN WITH HEALING ABILITIES

00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:44.790
IS A GRAND TOTAL OF TWO.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.257
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:48.490
ONE OF THEM GOT SO TIRED
OF BEING FOUGHT OVER,

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.557
THE LEFT THE ACCELERATED WORLD
FOR GOOD.

00:14:50.557 --> 00:14:54.257
SO THEN, ASIDE FROM LIME BELL,
THERE’S JUST ONE OTHER HEALER
OUT THERE?

00:14:54.257 --> 00:14:58.457
YES, AND THAT PERSON
IS CURRENTLY ONE
OF THE SIX KINGS.

00:14:58.457 --> 00:14:59.990
A KING?! WOW!

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:01.257
SO WHAT COLOR ARE THEY?

00:15:01.257 --> 00:15:03.857
UM, SENPAI?

00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:06.023
I’M SORRY, BUT I’D PREFER

00:15:06.023 --> 00:15:08.757
NOT TO EVEN TELL YOU
WHAT THAT PERSON’S NAME IS.

00:15:08.757 --> 00:15:11.490
THE LAST THING I WANT,
HARUYUKI,

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.690
IS FOR YOU
TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST
BIT OF INTEREST IN THEM.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.490
YEAH, BUT...

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.857
( groans softly )
IT’S NOT THAT
I DON’T TRUST YOU.

00:15:18.857 --> 00:15:20.623
I KNOW YOU AREN’T INTERESTED
IN THE OTHER KINGS

00:15:20.623 --> 00:15:23.090
AND WILL MOST LIKELY
NEVER BE TEMPTED BY THEM.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.890
BUT I CAN’T STOP
WORRYING ABOUT IT.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.823
( whimpers )

00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:31.157
HARUYUKI,

00:15:31.157 --> 00:15:33.490
WHERE YOU BELONG’S WITH ME.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.923
( whimpering )
YOU ALWAYS HAVE,
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL.

00:15:36.923 --> 00:15:40.590
FOR ALL ETERNITY,
I’LL NEVER GIVE YOU UP.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.390
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.757
WE GOT A LITTLE OFF-TRACK.
ALL RIGHT, AS I WAS SAYING,

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:49.723
HAVING THE ABILITY TO HEAL
IS EXTREMELY RARE
IN ACCELERATED WORLD,

00:15:49.723 --> 00:15:52.157
WHICH MAKES HEALERS
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.

00:15:52.157 --> 00:15:53.090
I SEE.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.690
SO THEN, WHERE IS KURASHIMA?

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.823
WELL IF I WERE TO GUESS,

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:58.123
SHE’S BEING LECTURED BY TAKU

00:15:58.123 --> 00:15:59.823
ON WHY SHE SHOULD
KEEP A LOW PROFILE

00:15:59.823 --> 00:16:01.090
AND NOT DO ANYTHING RASH.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.223
SHE AND I SHOULD
PROBABLY MEET, TOO.

00:16:03.223 --> 00:16:06.523
I THINK A HEART-TO-HEART CHAT
WOULD DO BOTH OF US GOOD.

00:16:06.523 --> 00:16:08.190
YEAH, I GUESS YOU’RE RIGHT.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.657
( thinking )
<i>THOSE TWO HAVING</i>
<i>A HEART-TO-HEART CHAT?</i>

00:16:11.657 --> 00:16:14.090
<i>THAT IS SO GONNA GET MESSY.</i>

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.290
( birds chirping )

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.357
Chiyuri: <i>LEGIONS?</i>

00:16:16.357 --> 00:16:17.357
Taku: YEAH.

00:16:17.357 --> 00:16:19.423
AND THE LEGION THAT HARU
AND I BELONG TO

00:16:19.423 --> 00:16:21.090
IS CALLED THE NEGA NEBULOUS.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.557
AND YOUR LEADER
IS KUROYUKIHIME?

00:16:24.557 --> 00:16:27.390
YES.
WELL, OKAY.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.690
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.823
I AM.
THAT WAY THE THREE OF US
CAN BE TOGETHER AGAIN

00:16:31.823 --> 00:16:33.057
LIKE WE USED TO BE.

00:16:33.057 --> 00:16:35.390
IT’LL BE JUST
LIKE OLD TIMES.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.990
BUT CHI...

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.057
WE <i>CAN</i> GO BACK, RIGHT?

00:16:39.057 --> 00:16:41.590
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE?

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.923
WE’LL TALK AGAIN TOMORROW.

00:16:44.923 --> 00:16:47.490
OH, BY THE WAY, LET ME KNOW
IF THERE’S SOMETHING

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.390
YOU WANT ME TO BRING BACK
FOR YOU FROM OKINAWA.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.557
OKINAWA?
YOU’RE GOING AWAY?

00:16:52.557 --> 00:16:54.023
DIDN’T YOU KNOW THIS?

00:16:54.023 --> 00:16:55.890
IT’S A SCHOOL TRIP
